Video-Based Coaching as an Educational Platform for Urological Residency Training: A Pilot Study	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						instructional film and video; mentoring; teaching rounds; urologic surgical procedures	GENERAL-SURGERY; IMPLEMENTATION; BARRIERS; ERRORS; SKILLS	Introduction: Surgical experience requires skills traditionally taught through real- time operating room education and a variety of supplemental educational strategies. Video-based coaching is a modality that may offer potential advantages of immediate, direct and targeted feedback. The objective of this study was to demonstrate and evaluate the utility and educational value of videobased coaching in urology by conducting a qualitative analysis with a coding schema. Methods: Residents and attendings were recorded operating during randomly selected cases in the operating room. Video-based coaching sessions were held during urology grand rounds and required residents to describe a selected portion of the operating room video and attendings to provide teaching points. Audio recordings from the operating room and video-based coaching sessions were reviewed by 2 independent coders. A coding scale classifying surgical educational goals into 5 categories (information, operative technique, questioning, response to resident interaction and unrelated commenting) was used to identify the interactions and was adjusted for time. Results: Four urological cases were selected for recording. In the video-based coaching sessions compared to the operating room, attendings made more teaching points per hour, provided more information to residents (mean teaching points 7.7 for video-based coaching vs 2.9 for operating room, p < 0.005), emphasized operative skills and technique (mean teaching points 10.5 for videobased coaching vs 4.1 for operating room, p < 0.005), and were more likely to ask open-ended discussion leading questions (mean teaching points 28.5 for video-based coaching vs 4.4 for operating room, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Video-based coaching delivered in short time frames offers an easily implementable additional learning opportunity for resident education to further enhance skills learned in the urological operating room.

Multidisciplinary Approach Study C	A Mobile Phone Application for Assessing Daily Variation in Pain Location and Pain Intensity in Patients with Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome: A MAPP Network Study	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						prostatitis; mobile applications; ecological momentary assessment; data collection	MOMENTARY	Introduction: We created and tested a mobile app that facilitates the ecological momentary assessment of pain intensity and pain location and identifies heterogeneous patient pain phenotypes. Methods: A mobile app was created with patient, clinician and researcher input. A sample of 20 participants with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome were then asked to complete a 14-day pain assessment using the app. Data were analyzed to assess compliance, usability and the ability for the app to capture variation in pain intensity and pain location. Ecological momentary assessment pain data were then compared to end-of-week pain summary questions to determine construct validity. Results: Mean compliance was 70 +/- 8%, higher earlier in the study period (p <0.0005) and better in older individuals (p <0.0001). During the 14-day assessment, 90% of participants reported daily variation in pelvic pain intensity (SD 0.64-3.02; out of 10), 95% reported variation in their nonpelvic pain (SD 0.17-3.63; out of 10) and 100% reported variations in number of sites with pain (SD 0.22-1.44; out of 7). Pelvic pain and nonpelvic pain intensity, as determined by cumulative app scores, were associated with patient reported end-of-week scores; worst pain (r(pelvic)=0.67; r(numpelvic)=0.53) and average pain (r(pelvic)=0.78; r(numpelvic)=0.73). Conclusions: The easy-to-use app captured unique patterns of pain not fully captured by traditional end-of-day/week summary questions or by traditional in-office assessments. Mobile apps for assessing chronic conditions will become increasingly important as telehealth becomes more commonplace.

Increasing Comorbidity and Frailty is Not Associated with Early Postoperative Complications among Men Undergoing Artificial Urinary Sphincter or Sling Implantation: A Real-World Application of NSQIP (R) Data to Reconstructive Urology	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						urinary incontinence; stress; frailty	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; POSTPROSTATECTOMY INCONTINENCE; PATIENT SATISFACTION; MORBIDITY; CONTINENCE; MORTALITY; INDEX	Introduction: Urologists may be hesitant to surgically treat urinary incontinence in comorbid genitourinary cancer survivors. We assessed the relationship between comorbidities and 30-day perioperative outcomes following artificial urinary sphincter and sling implantation. Methods: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, patients with CPT codes for artificial urinary sphincter and sling implantation were identified between 2007 and 2015. The patient's Charlson comorbidity index and Frailty Index scores were calculated based on ICD-9 codes. The primary outcome was presence of perioperative complications. The association between Charlson comorbidity index and Frailty Index and each primary outcome was investigated using multivariate logistic regression models. Results: We queried 1,370 and 1,018 records with artificial urinary sphincter and sling implantation, respectively. The median Charlson comorbidity index for artificial urinary sphincter patients was 4.0 (Q1 3, Q3 5), while for sling patients it was 3.0 (Q1 3, Q3 4). In the artificial urinary sphincter cohort, 47% had 1 Frailty Index condition, whereas 25% had 2 or more Frailty Index conditions. In the sling group, 42% had 1 Frailty Index condition, while 19% had 2 or more Frailty Index conditions. The event rate for overall complications was 5.4% and 3.0% in the artificial urinary sphincter and sling cohort, respectively. After adjusting for covariates in both the artificial urinary sphincter and sling cohort Charlson comorbidity index or Frailty Index was not associated with the odds of having a complication. Conclusions: The presence of increased comorbidities or frailty is not associated with short-term postoperative complications among men undergoing artificial urinary sphincter or sling implantation.

However, this phenomenon is not well understood. The purpose of this review is to offer an update in the evolving hypothesis of how benign prostate hypertrophy may be protective in prostate cancer. Methods: A literature search was conducted on PubMed limited to articles published within the past 10 years with the search criteria of "interaction" AND "benign prostate hypertrophy" AND "prostate cancer" as well as the key words of this paper. Results: Nine articles from the literature search met inclusion criteria. The articles analyze the prostate on parameters of peripheral zone volume, glandular tissue density and prostate capsule thickness. All 9 articles described peripheral zone atrophy and transition zone hypertrophy in benign prostate hypertrophy patients. Conclusions: As the transition zone grows in benign prostate hypertrophy, volume and glandular density of the peripheral zone as well as the prostate capsule undergo significant changes. The disease processes outlined in this review support the hypothesis that the growing transition zone compresses the peripheral zone against the prostatic capsule causing secondary atrophy, apoptosis, and necrosis of the peripheral zone's glandular tissue. If this hypertrophy-induced disease process of glandular tissue atrophy within the peripheral zone is confirmed in future studies, it will have relevant clinical implications on the diagnosis and treatment of benign prostate hypertrophy and prostate cancer.

The Association of Medicaid Insurance and Affordable Care Act Expansions with Survival among Patients with Testicular Cancer	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						testis; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Medicare; policy; socioeconomic factors	HEALTH; DISPARITIES; OUTCOMES	Introduction: Following passage of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid access was expanded in several states beginning in 2014. We sought to determine the oncologic implications by comparing outcomes between testicular germ cell tumor patients with Medicaid and those without insurance, and by assessing for changes in outcomes after 2014. Methods: A total of 18,506 men with seminomatous or nonseminomatous germ cell tumors were identified within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2007-2016). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards, Fine and Gray competing-risks regression, propensity score matching, cumulative incidence plots and segmented Poisson regression models were used. Results: Compared to no insurance, Medicaid insurance was not associated with differences in all-cause mortality or cancer-specific mortality among seminoma patients (all-cause mortality: HR=1.24, p=0.87; cancer-specific mortality: HR=0.92, p=0.75) or nonseminoma patients (all-cause mortality: HR=1.13, p=0.33; cancer-specific mortality: HR=1.10, p=0.51). Among matched Medicaid and uninsured patients, there was again no difference in cancer-specific mortality for those with seminoma (p=0.81) or nonseminoma (p=0.23). There was a 99% increase in Medicaid enrollment in expansion states in the post-Affordable Care Act era. There was no difference in post-expansion all-cause mortality between expansion states and nonexpansion states for men with seminoma (p=0.42) or nonseminoma (p=0.53). Conclusions: Medicaid enrollment increased in expansion states following the Affordable Care Act. However, there was no difference in survival between Medicaid patients and uninsured patients, or between patients in expansion states versus nonexpansion states, highlighting the need for population-level policy interventions to improve access and quality of care among testicular cancer patients with Medicaid.

Primary Care Physician Perspectives on Low Risk Prostate Cancer Management: Results of a National Survey	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						physicians; primary care; urologists; watchful waiting; attitude; prostatic neoplasms	ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE; PATIENT PREFERENCES; DECISION-MAKING; FOLLOW-UP; INVOLVEMENT; PROVIDERS	Introduction: Primary care providers can collaborate with urologists to ensure men with low risk prostate cancer on active surveillance receive followup testing and adhere to the management strategy, yet primary care provider attitudes about active surveillance and their roles remain unknown. Methods: We surveyed 1,000 primary care providers (347/741 eligible primary care providers responded). We assessed primary care provider support for and beliefs about active surveillance, and attitudes about and preferences for their role in various aspects of low risk prostate cancer management. We then examined associations between 1) primary care provider support for and primary care provider beliefs about active surveillance; and 2) primary care provider attitudes and preferences for their role. Results: Nearly 50% of primary care providers strongly supported active surveillance for all low risk men, and 81% strongly agreed that active surveillance allows men to avoid side effects, while 57% strongly agreed it caused worry. Primary care providers who strongly supported active surveillance were less likely to strongly agree that active surveillance contributes to worry (50.3% vs 63.7% respectively, p=0.01). Half of the primary care providers strongly agreed that primary care providers can provide cancer-related care (50.5%), and the majority preferred a shared care model to ordering prostate specific antigen tests (60.1%). Primary care providers who strongly agreed that primary care providers can provide cancer-related care were more likely to prefer a primary care provider-led (79.3% vs 20.7%) or shared care (53.9% vs 46.1%) model vs urologist-led for ordering prostate specific antigen tests (p <0.01). Conclusions: While many primary care providers supported active surveillance for low risk prostate cancer, primary care providers still had concerns with it as the primary management strategy.

Clinical Utility of Postneoadjuvant Chemotherapy Computerized Tomography for Muscle Invasive Urothelial Bladder Cancer	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						urinary bladder neoplasms; neoadjuvant therapy; tomography; emission-computed; cystectomy	NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY; CT; CYSTECTOMY; CARCINOMA; SURVIVAL	Introduction: For muscle invasive bladder cancer, computerized tomography scans are often used before cystectomy to optimize surgical decision planning. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical value of postneoadjuvant chemotherapy computerized tomography in patients with localized bladder cancer before cystectomy. Methods: All T2-3N0 patients with urothelial bladder cancer who completed cisplatin based neoadjuvant chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. On postneoadjuvant chemotherapy computerized tomography patients with tumor progression, nodal involvement, metastatic disease and noncancer findings were determined, and subsequent surgical decision making was evaluated. Results: Of 79 cases 21.5% had a new finding on postneoadjuvant chemotherapy scan of which false-positive rates for nodal and metastatic disease were 100%. The frequency of novel findings on postneoadjuvant computerized tomography were 4 (5.1%) with tumor progression, 6 (7.6%) newly discovered enlarged nodes, 8 (10.1%) suspicious for distant metastases and 3 (3.8%) noncancer related conditions. Only 3.8% (3) had alterations in original cystectomy plans exclusively due to tumor progression and 100% of the cohort underwent cystectomy. Overall survival was not associated with new findings (3-year OS 77.4% vs 74%, p=0.473). Median time from postneoadjuvant chemotherapy scan to cystectomy was statistically delayed for patients with new radiographic findings vs those with consistent preneoadjuvant chemotherapy scans (29.5 vs 51 days; p=0.014). Conclusions: Compared to the preneoadjuvant chemotherapy scans, our data suggests that postneoadjuvant chemotherapy computerized tomography scans discover new findings in approximately 21.5% of cases, but this rarely changes preoperative plans, is not associated with overall survival and is frequently associated with false-positive results.

Methods: We proposed an innovative clinic systems redesign-"shared medical appointments" (SMAs)-in which multiple patients were seen in a group format at the same time by the health care team led by a urologist leading the Institution's AS program. Results: We piloted four SMAs during July-November 2019. Running the SMAs was feasible and improved the contact time for each patient while at the same time being time and resource efficient for the health care providers and using the standard billing processes. The group dynamic was open and pleasant. The majority of patients rated their overall experience with SMA as excellent. Almost all patients responded that they were likely or very likely to attend another SMA in the future. All patients said that they would either definitely or probably recommend this visit type to a friend of family member with prostate cancer. Most patients rated their overall satisfaction with the SMA as extremely high. Conclusions: Utilizing SMAs for AS followup visits was feasible and acceptable. Our promising findings suggest that SMAs can ensure high-quality patient care. Well-controlled studies comparing SMAs to individual usual care visits should be conducted with end points including knowledge, patient and staff satisfaction, anxiety and quality-of-life outcomes, AS adherence, process measures and resource utilization.

There are conflicting reports regarding whether these procedures should be combined into 1 surgical setting or staged. We sought to evaluate the safety of performing these procedures in the same operative setting. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization (HCUP) State Inpatient Database (SID) and State Ambulatory Surgery Database (SASD) for the states of California (2007-2011) and Florida (2009-2014). ICD-9-CM diagnosis and CPT codes were used to identify adult males who underwent both PP and AUS implantation and outcomes regarding readmissions, emergency room (ER) presentations, and complications were reviewed. Results: Patients undergoing synchronous PP-AUS implantation had significantly higher 90-day readmission rates (13.9% vs 7.2%, p <0.001), suffered higher rates of device complications (6.1% vs 3.4%, p=0.021), and were more likely to have minor complications (8.89% vs 2.35%, p <0.001) compared to nonsynchronous device placement. No differences in major complications or 90-day ER visits were observed. Conclusions: Synchronous PP and AUS implantation is feasible but may be associated with higher readmission rates, device complications and postoperative complications compared to a staged approach. This further validates findings from prior studies.

Although vasectomy techniques and outcomes have steadily improved, postvasectomy semen analysis compliance remains a significant challenge. The aim of this study was to assess if home testing improved postvasectomy semen analysis compliance. Methods: Data were collected prospectively but retrospectively reviewed between 2007 and 2019 from a single surgeon's high volume practice. Subjects were divided into 2 groups based on postvasectomy semen analysis method (home vs office) and further subdivided by compliance status. Patients were considered compliant if they provided at least 1 semen sample postvasectomy. Statistical analysis was completed to determine factors predictive of compliance. Results: A total of 364 patients were included. Median age for the home group vs the office group was similar (42 years [IQR 39-46] vs 41 years [IQR 38-46]). Median number of children for both groups was 2 (IQR 2-3). In all, 109 men (30.0%) opted for at-home testing. No significant difference in compliance was found (59.6% of home test vs 58.8% of laboratory patients, p=0.89). No statistically significant difference in patient demographics (age, partner age, number of children, smoking and alcohol) was observed, and there were no demographic factors predicting compliance with regression modeling. Conclusions: At-home semen analysis kits did not significantly improve compliance. Clinicians should be aware that this may be a reasonable alternative for those who are unable to obtain a postvasectomy semen analysis in-office.

Patient and Provider Experience with Telemedicine in a Urology Practice: Identifying Opportunities for Improvement	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						telemedicine; personal satisfaction; urologists; pilot projects; prospective studies	METHODOLOGY	Introduction: As a result of COVID-19, several clinics have adopted telemedicine to safely deliver care. However, the introduction of a new technology into an already complex system creates new challenges that have the potential to negatively impact patient and provider experience. We aimed to use a human factors approach (the science concerned with understanding the interactions between humans and other elements in a complex system) to identify where systemic vulnerabilities may exist throughout the patient/provider experience with telemedicine. Methods: A total of 23 patients scheduled for telemedicine consults were observed during visits with providers. A trained human factors observer documented disruptions to system efficiency (eg communication breakdowns, connectivity problems and interruptions) and invited patients and providers to take a survey investigating perceptions of telemedicine technology usability, satisfaction with the experience and opportunities to improve the process. Results: Visits lasted an average of 17 minutes, 20 seconds and each visit had an average of 6 disruptions. Inefficiencies were categorized into 13 categories consisting mainly of interruptions (21, 15.22%), Internet connectivity issues (21, 15.22%), nonoptimal device setup (19, 13.77%) and repeat communication (18, 13.04%). Provider satisfaction with the system was 3.72/5.00 and perceived usability was 63.15 (68 is considered acceptable). Patient satisfaction was 4.80/5.00 and perceived usability was 85. Conclusions: These findings highlight opportunities for a multifaceted intervention, including the development of an informational sheet/video for patients, a telemedicine "best practices" guideline for physicians, a standardized training process and checklist for front office staff and an in-service training for the entire care team.

Use of Lean Methodologies in Outpatient Urology Clinic	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						quality improvement; ambulatory care facilities; time and motion studies; appointments and schedules		Introduction: Our objective was to apply lean methodologies to identify and improve processes in the urology clinic. Methods: A total of 85 appointments in provider and procedure clinics were observed and analyzed using time studies, spaghetti diagrams and process mapping tools. The team determined wait times and rework as areas for quality improvement. Rework is defined as the technician or provider having to see the patient multiple, separate times during a visit. We implemented assigning 1 technician to 1 provider, prepping patient charts in advance, and daily huddles. The team performed a PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act) cycle and observed 53 more appointments. Results: Through these interventions the clinic saw improvements in all areas of concern. In the provider clinic, the initial wait times decreased by 63%. Rework decreased by 48%. The overall number of technician rework decreased by 17% and overall provider rework decreased by 50% saving a median of 6 minutes per visit. The procedure clinic saw improvements including up to a 43% decrease in the initial wait time, the chance of all rework decreasing by 55% and the technician rework decreased by 36%, saving 16 minutes per visit. Conclusions: These interventions proved beneficial in reducing waste and operating a more effective and efficient clinic.

Studies have shown correlation between nonmodifiable patient attributes and satisfaction scores. This study aims to investigate potential patient bias in survey scores associated with payer type in an academic urology outpatient clinic setting. Methods: The survey results of 20,944 patients seen in an academic urology clinic were analyzed, and the weighted mean +/- SD scores of patient experience in 6 major payer categories were compared: 1) commercial insurance, 2) Medicare, 3) Medicaid, 4) other government plans, 5) workers' comp and 6) self-pay/uncompensated. ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer Honestly Significant Difference were utilized to assess statistical significance. Results: Medicare patients reported the highest satisfaction scores (93.03), followed by other government coverage (91.49), commercial insurance (91.32), workers' comp (90.72), Medicaid (89.21) and self-pay/uncompensated (89.00). ANOVA analysis resulted in an F value of 40.198 (p <0.001). Tukey-Kramer demonstrated statistical significance in the difference between the means of the following groups: commercial vs Medicaid (p <0.001), commercial vs Medicare (p <0.001), commercial vs self-pay/uncompensated (p <0.01), other government vs Medicaid (p <0.001), other government vs Medicare (p <0.01), Medicaid vs Medicare (p <0.001), Medicare vs self-pay/uncompensated (p <0.001). Conclusions: Our data suggest that patient experience scores are impacted by the type of coverage the patient carries and not only by the quality of care provided. Urology clinicians should be aware of these nuances when selecting MIPS quality reporting metrics. Currently, these biased scores may have an impact on physicians' reimbursement, and policymakers should consider adjusting reimbursement according to payer-mix.

UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						prostatic neoplasm; prostatectomy; blood grouping and crossmatching; costs and cost analysis	TRANSFUSION; IDENTIFICATION; INFORMATION; POPULATION; ANTIBODY; PATIENT	Purpose: Despite low rates of transfusion associated with robotic prostatectomy, surgeons routinely obtain preoperative blood typing. Here we aim to understand the cost savings associated with eliminating blood typing prior to prostatectomy. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of our single surgeon radical prostatectomy database was performed. Patients receiving blood transfusions within 3 days of prostatectomy were identified and clinical characteristics were recorded. Cost information was obtained, and descriptive statistical analysis performed. Results: 1,581 patients underwent prostatectomy from 2000 to 2019. Thirty-two patients (2.02%) received a transfusion within 3 days of surgery. The transfusion rate for open prostatectomy was 3.21% vs 1.37% for robotic prostatectomy. The cost of preoperative blood typing for all radical prostatectomies was $113,832, or about $5,812.70 per year. Conclusions: Transfusion rates for prostatectomy are low and decline with experience. Significant cost savings is possible by avoiding routine preoperative blood typing in most patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.

We sought to determine whether a pay gap existed in urology and explore potential associated factors. Methods: We used 2,323 responses to the 2017 American Urological Association census to represent all 12,517 U.S. urologists. We limited analysis to ages 34 to 65 and matched on years in practice. We explored the association between self-reported salary (more than $350,000 vs less than $350,000) and gender using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age and practice. Results: On bivariate analysis males were more likely to make more than $350,000 (56.9% vs 39.7%, p=0.01). There were no gender differences in weekly clinical (43.1 female vs 46.9 male, p=0.13) or nonclinical hours (7.9 female vs 9.1 male, p=0.23). Men do more inpatient procedures per month (7.8 vs 5.6, p=0.02) and more patient visits per week (78.4 vs. 68.4, p=0.04). Women spent more time with each patient (17.6 vs 14.9 minutes, p <0.01). On unadjusted logistic regression men were more likely to earn more than $350,000 (OR 2.01, p=0.02). On multivariable regression, gender was no longer significant (OR 1.59, p=0.11). Factors associated with earning more than $350,000 include more clinical/fewer nonclinical hours, shorter/more office visits, more inpatient surgeries, private practice, subspecialty training, Northeast location and nonWhite race. Conclusions: This analysis suggests a gender pay gap. While men and women work equal hours, women urologists are more likely to work in less profitable settings, perform fewer inpatient procedures and see fewer patients. Future research needs to understand whether women choose these practices or whether external factors compel them to do so.

Methods: Data on third line overactive bladder procedure volume was obtained from the American Board of Urology annualized case logs between 2010 and 2016. Entries from certifying, recertifying, and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery applying urologists were considered. Statistical analysis was then performed to identify trends and surgeon characteristics that predicted the number of procedures performed. Results: Case log reported procedures of third line therapies increased from 1,822 in 2010 to a peak of 6,143 in 2013. From 2010 to 2016, 25% (1,375/5,499) of all urologists logged at least 1 chemodenervation or neuromodulation procedure, while only 2 urologists logged percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation cases. In total, 26,874 neuromodulation or chemodenervation procedures were logged. Neuromodulation usage peaked in 2013, the year of U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for chemodenervation, and has since been declining. Chemodenervation procedures increased each year after 2013 until declining in 2016. Female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery surgeons performed significantly more procedures than all other specialty categories (p <= 0.01). Gender, practice region, practice size and practice setting were also significant predictors of the number of procedures performed. Conclusions: Chemodenervation and neuromodulation have increased considerably in the past 6 years. There are differences in the types of procedures being performed based on gender, sub-specialty, certification status, practice region, practice size and practice setting.

We employed an online, interactive decision aid for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia as a routine part of care with a urologist and tracked subsequent treatment choice. We further evaluated the role of patient preferences on treatment selection. Methods: Men scheduled for a new patient visit with a urologist for benign prostatic hyperplasia at a single tertiary care center were invited to use a decision aid prior to their visit. We compared treatment patterns in men who used the decision aid to a usual care group identified prior to the decision aid's introduction. Latent class analysis identified clusters of patients by their treatment preferences, which were then compared to their treatment choice. Results: The rate of procedures in the decision aid group was significantly lower than in the usual care group (6% vs 15%; p=0.0250), matching the rates reporting a procedure as their preferred treatment choice in the post-consult questionnaire (5% vs 15%; p=0.0082). Of the patients in our project 36% had never tried an alpha blocker prior to their urology consult. Latent class analysis found 2 clusters of patient preferences but without a significant association with final treatment selection. Conclusions: Use of a decision aid was associated with a significant decrease in procedural management of benign prostatic hyperplasia. A high proportion of patients were evaluated by urologists without exhausting primary care management options.

Virtual Urology Education in the Epicenter of COVID-19: Development and Outcomes of the Educational Multi-Institutional Program for Instructing REsidents (EMPIRE) Lecture Series	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						education; medical; COVID-19; internship and residency	SPACED EDUCATION; HEALTH-PROFESSIONS; MEDICAL-STUDENTS	Introduction: Sustaining resident education efforts during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic required innovative, virtual didactic programs. This article reviews the authors' collaborative experience with launching the Educational Multi-institutional Program for Instructing REsidents (EMPIRE) lecture series in the New York Section of the American Urological Association. Methods: From April 13, 2020 to May 29, 2020, there were 68 EMPIRE lectures delivered via Zoom videoconferencing that were based on a variety of topics highlighted in the AUA Core Curriculum. Tracking tools from Zoom, Google Analytics from the New York Section website and YouTube Analytics were used to assess participant access of didactic materials. Additionally, a survey regarding the content and impact of the series was distributed and advertised to those who had attended the lecture series. Results: The average number of participants was 159 +/- 68 per lecture (range 77 to 334) and the recordings received 9,086 total video views (range 42 to 443 views per video) at the time of survey completion. The survey received 170 total responses. The majority of speakers (77%) and participants (58%) were from the New York Section. Half of the participants were residents (50%) and others were attending urologists (35%), fellows (5%), medical students (9%), and advanced practice providers (1%). Survey respondents reported consistently high ratings of the EMPIRE series. Overall, 99% of respondents said that they would recommend the EMPIRE series to a colleague and 98% requested that the series continue after COVID-19 abates. Conclusions: The EMPIRE didactic series was well received, with the majority of participants positively endorsing its value. Further initiatives pertaining to virtual education for urology trainees should continue to be explored.

J	Golan, R; Haas, C; Shah, O				Golan, Ron; Haas, Christopher; Shah, Ojas			After-Hours and Weekend Phone Calls by Urological Subspecialty at a Tertiary Care Institution	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						ambulatory care; call centers; after-hours care	ON-CALL; FATIGUE; SKILLS; SLEEP; WORK	Introduction: Many urology practices offer after-hours answering services through which patients or outside providers may access an on-call provider. These lines of communication are often unfiltered, allowing for a combination of urgent and non-urgent matters to reach the provider. The objective of this study was to evaluate the nature and frequency of after-hours phone calls among urological subspecialties. Methods: Phone calls occurring after-hours during the week (5 pm-7:59 am), weekends, and federal holidays were captured over 2019. The patient's provider and reason for calling were captured. The adult subspecialties included were endourology, oncology, reconstructive urology, female urology/voiding dysfunction, andrology/sexual medicine, and multispecialty/general. The reason for calling was categorized as either urgent/non-avoidable or non-urgent/avoidable, and the volume of after-hours and overnight calls was compared amongst subspecialties using the number of calls per 100 unique patients. Results: There were 2,224 after-hours calls over the 1-year period; 48% of telephone calls were regarding urgent matters, while the remainder were non-urgent or potentially avoidable. Reconstructive and endourology had the highest number of after-hours calls (34.8 calls and 17.3 calls per 100 patients, respectively). Reconstructive received the most urgent overnight phone calls at 3 calls per 100 patients, followed by oncology (1.55 per 100 patients) and endourology (1.35 per 100 patients). Conclusions: Each urological subspecialty has varying acuity, which may influence the number of after-hours calls. Providers and their staff should optimize their work flow through triaging, counseling, and education in order to reduce the number of non-urgent after-hours calls.

Impact of Enhanced Recovery after Surgery Protocols on Opioid Prescriptions at Discharge after Major Urological Cancer Surgery	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						enhanced recovery after surgery; opioid epidemic; pain management; medication therapy management; analgesics, opioid		Introduction: Enhanced recovery after surgery protocols are designed to limit the use of opioids during inpatient stay to facilitate recovery and early discharge. It is not clear whether the enhanced recovery after surgery related limitations on opioids are associated with opioid prescribing at discharge. We wished to evaluate whether the enhanced recovery after surgery efforts had an impact on opioid prescriptions given after discharge following major urological cancer surgery. Methods: We reviewed the opioid prescription data following hospital discharge after major urological cancer surgery from 2016 to 2018, including cystectomy, renal surgery (total, partial) and prostatectomy. Patient calls and refill requests were recorded for 30 days after discharge. Multivariable analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of various factors on normalized opioid tablets given at discharge. Results: A total of 409 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 207 before and 202 after ERAS protocols. Following enhanced recovery after surgery, potent opioid (oxycodone, hydrocodone) prescriptions decreased by 53% while tramadol use increased by more than four-fold (p <0.001). Reduction in opioid prescriptions was noted for prostatectomy (30%, p <0.001), cystectomy (27%, p=0.02) and all renal procedures (32%, p <0.001) after enhanced recovery after surgery protocol. On multivariable analysis, enhanced recovery after surgery protocol was an independent predictor of reduced opioids given at discharge. Conclusions: Enhanced recovery after surgery protocol implementation was associated with a significant decrease in the opioid prescriptions at discharge after all major urological cancer procedures. Prescribing patterns shifted away from more potent opioids. These findings provide a benchmark for further interventions and reduction in the outpatient opioid prescriptions after open and minimally invasive surgery.

The aim of our study is to employ time driven activity based costing to characterize institutional costs of 3 management pathways for vesicoureteral reflux. Methods: We developed process maps for vesicoureteral reflux management based on practice guidelines applicable to a hypothetical female patient with vesicoureteral reflux index with grade 3 unilateral reflux without bowel bladder dysfunction at our institution. The costs of 3 management pathways were described, including watch and wait, minimally invasive endoscopic surgery with dextranomer/hyaluronic acid and open re-implantation surgery. Costs for each pathway were calculated using the capacity cost rate ($/minute) for institutional resources and time estimates of resource use captured through direct observation and electronic medical record data. Clinical outcomes such as the breakthrough urinary tract infections or renal scarring were not addressed in this cost description. Results: A substantial range of total costs ($CAD) was observed for all pathways including watch and wait ($1,683.58 to $2,041.12), minimally invasive endoscopic surgery ($2,616.35 to $4,012.89) and open re-implantation surgery ($3,317.76 to $3,924.82). Total costs for a single dimercaptosuccinic acid scan accounted for 8% to 15% of any pathway's overall costs. Material costs for voiding cystourethrogram imaging and endoscopic surgery were high at 59% and 64% to 76% of their individual total costs, respectively. For open re-implantation surgery, high costs were attributable to the longer use of operating room space and inpatient postoperative stay. Conclusions: Time driven activity based costing demonstrates significant cost variability in vesicoureteral reflux treatment modalities and identified local cost drivers to target. Results from this study may be used to inform future cost-effectiveness analyses.

Methenamine Prophylaxis for Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections in a Tertiary Referral Center	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						methenamine; urinary tract infections; retrospective studies	EFFICACY	Introduction: Methenamine hippurate (MH) is a urinary antiseptic, indicated for prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) but with only few and limited studies regarding its efficacy. To help address this knowledge gap we reviewed our experience with MH for UTI prophylaxis, focusing on women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs. Methods: The University of Kentucky electronic health record was queried to identify adults who were prescribed MH from the urology clinic between January 2013 and January 2019. Charts were reviewed to assess patient-reported UTI frequency, demographics and relevant health factors. Treatment success was defined as 0-1 UTI in 6 months or 0-2 UTIs in 1 year. Results: Of 670 patients prescribed MH, 508 did not meet inclusion criteria. The most common reasons for exclusion were complicated UTI, no return visit, treatment nonadherence and insufficient followup time. The primary study population was 162 women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs: 41 premenopausal and 121 postmenopausal. Success rates with MH were 83% and 77%, respectively. Success rates were not significantly associated with age, diabetes, immune suppression, high-tone pelvic floor dysfunction or (if postmenopausal) vaginal estrogen use. Exploratory study of patients using intermittent catheterization showed success in 20 of 30 patients (67%). Conclusions: MH had high success rates for premenopausal and postmenopausal women with recurrent uncomplicated UTIs. Patients using catheters had lower success rates. Prospective trials would strengthen the evidence to guide decisions for treatment and insurance coverage.

Yearly Trends of Overactive Bladder Medication Usage	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						urinary bladder; overactive; urinary bladder; neurogenic	PRESCRIBING HABITS; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; PERSISTENCE; MIRABEGRON; EFFICACY; SAFETY	Introduction: Anticholinergics are associated with cognitive side effects and dementia. Agents such as trospium, fesoterodine and darifenacin have been shown to be less likely to cross the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, in 2012, mirabegron was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as the first beta-3 adrenoreceptor agonist to treat overactive bladder (OAB). This study aims to examine prescribing patterns of OAB medications in the United States over time. Methods: The 2013-2017 Medicare Part D Public Use File was used to identify prescribers of OAB medications including oxybutynin, tolterodine, trospium, darifenacin, solifenacin, fesoterodine and mirabegron. The number of claims and total annual expenditure for each medication for all prescribers, nonurologists and urologists were analyzed from 2013 to 2017. Results: Oxybutynin was consistently the most prescribed OAB medication each year, comprising 53.9% of all OAB medication prescriptions in 2017. From 2013 to 2017, mirabegron claims increased from 140,401 to 1,617,439, making it the second most prescribed OAB medication. Solifenacin usage decreased each year. Trospium, darifenacin and fesoterodine were the least prescribed agents each year. These trends were similar for those >= 65 years old. Total annual expenditure for mirabegron increased yearly, and it had the highest total expenditure of OAB medications, with $658.6 million in 2017. Conclusions: Oxybutynin was consistently the most prescribed OAB medication every year. Mirabegron utilization steadily increased each year. Anticholinergic medications associated with fewer cognitive adverse effects, such as trospium, darifenacin and fesoterodine, were among the least prescribed.

Disposable versus Reusable Cystoscopes: A Micro-Costing Value Analysis in High-Volume and Low-Volume Urology Practices	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						cystoscopes; costs and cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; disposable equipment; equipment and supplies; hospital	URETERAL STENT REMOVAL; FLEXIBLE CYSTOSCOPE; ANTIBIOTIC-PROPHYLAXIS; URETEROSCOPY; QUALITY	Introduction: Disposable single-use cystoscopes have become increasingly available, demonstrating comparable quality to reusable cystoscopes while eliminating the need for reprocessing and repairs. However, high costs remain a concern. To clarify the role for these scopes, we performed a cost analysis comparison between the single-use Ambu (R) aScope (TM) 4 cystoscope and reusable Olympus (R) CYF-VHR and V2 cystoscopes in 2 clinical settings: a high- volume multi-provider practice and low-volume single-provider practice. Methods: The number of cystoscopies at each center was recorded between January and December 2019. Elements in the micro-costing analysis included the original purchasing price of the cystoscopes plus accessory equipment, sterilization supplies, repair costs, and personnel. Costs were amortized over 5 or 10 years and calculated on a per-case basis. An annual total cost analysis was performed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each device for each facility. Results: In 2019, 1,984 and 245 cystoscopic procedures were performed at the high and low-volume clinics, respectively. At the high-volume multi-provider practice, per-case cost for reusable cystoscopy amounted to $65.98 compared to $227.18 for single-use cystoscopy, with reusable equipment more cost-effective after 294 cystoscopies. At the low-volume single-provider practice, the per-case cost for reusable cystoscopy was $232.62 compared to $461.18 for single-use cystoscopy, with reusable equipment more cost-effective after 19 cases. Conclusions: Based on this micro-costing analysis, per-case costs favor reusable cystoscopes. While single-use cystoscope pricing may be prohibitive for large and small facilities at this present time, these instruments are powerful adjuncts to urologists' armamentaria when portability and efficiency are prioritized.

Mandated Opioid Online Training Course-Does it Impact Opioid Prescription Patterns for Outpatient Endoscopic Urological Surgeries?	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						analgesics,opioid; opioid epidemic; opioid substitution treatment; analgesics,non-narcotic; urologic surgical procedures		Introduction: Opioid addiction is a rising public health crisis. We evaluated if a New York State-mandated online opioid awareness course impacted our urology opioid prescription practices for outpatient endoscopic surgeries. Methods: We completed a retrospective review of all ambulatory endoscopic cases identified by CPT codes for all adult urology faculty between February 2016 and January 2018. Patients were divided into 2 cohorts, ie pre-mandated and post-mandated training. Patient demographics, procedure details, psychiatric history and postoperative pain prescriptions were collected. Changes in opioid prescription practices prior to and after the mandated online course were reviewed. Chi-square and linear regression analyses were performed. Results: A total of 356 cases were analyzed. After the training course, overall frequency of department opioid prescriptions did not change significantly (47.9% vs 47.5%, p=0.95). However, the percentage of patients receiving an oxycodone/acetaminophen prescription decreased from 90.2% to 63.0% (p <0.001) and the average number of tablets prescribed decreased (8.6 vs 16.9, p <0.001). On multivariate analysis, placement of a ureteral stent, older patient age and higher body mass index were predictors of an opioid prescription. In those patients who had a stent placed, nonopioid prescriptions increased from 42% to 88% (p <0.001). Conclusions: Overall, the New York State-mandated education session did impact opioid prescription practices for outpatient urological endoscopic surgery at our institution. The largest impact was seen within patients undergoing procedures requiring stent placement, with a decrease in total number of oxycodone/acetaminophen prescriptions and number of tablets prescribed per prescription. These data begin to demonstrate effective interventions that may impact physician practice patterns within opioid research.

A 30-Year Review of Cystectomy Litigation	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Review						cystectomy; urinary bladder neoplasms; defensive medicine; malpractice	MEDICAL MALPRACTICE; LIABILITY	Introduction: Annually the U.S. spends approximately $55.6 billion on malpractice and medical liability, with urology ranked 11th out of 25 specialties for number of malpractice claims. Our objective was to identify common causes for filing claims associated with cystectomy as well as corresponding payout outcomes. Methods: Using the Westlaw (R) legal database, a search was conducted using the keywords, "cystectomy," "cystoprostatectomy" and "bladder removal" between January 1, 1990 and January 1, 2020. Each case was evaluated for plaintiff demographics, alleged malpractice claim, defendant specialty, resulting clinical outcome, resulting legal outcome including verdict and monetary award. Alleged malpractice claims were further subdivided based on whether the claimed negligence of duty was preoperative, perioperative or postoperative. Data were analyzed using Microsoft (R) Office Excel (R). Results: After accounting for irrelevant and duplicate cases the Westlaw search returned 42 unique cases. The most common indication for cystectomy was bladder cancer (69%). Preoperative negligence resulted in the highest average payout ($2,062,204.00) and accounted for 76% of filed claims, with delay in diagnosis accounting for the most common complaint (47%). Urologists made up the highest percentage of defendants sued, at 62%. Conclusions: The bulk of alleged malpractice in cystectomy cases is due to preoperative negligence, most predominantly in the delay of cancer diagnosis. Alleged cases of preoperative negligence also return the highest award for the plaintiff. This study sheds light on areas of concern that urologists should be aware of associated with cystectomy litigation.

J	Pyun, S; Malik, RD				Pyun, Seongjoon; Malik, Rena Deep			Assessing the Quality of Online Patient Decision Aids for Urological Conditions	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						comprehension; readability; consumer health information; decision support techniques; decision aids	HEALTH INFORMATION; READABILITY; LITERACY	Introduction: A growing number of patients use online patient decision aids (PtDAs) due to their easy accessibility. However, PtDAs found on the internet are not regulated and vary in quality and readability. The aim of this study is to assess urological PtDAs for their readability, quality as consumer health information and quality as decision aid. Methods: Searches were conducted on Google, PubMed (R), Embase (R) and decision aid repositories for patient decision aids on pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, benign prostatic hyperplasia and overactive bladder. The decision aids were screened for relevance and patient directed nature. They were then evaluated using 4 readability formulas, the validated DISCERN quality criteria and the International Patient Decision Aids Standards v4.0 minimum standards criteria. Results: Our search revealed 23 patient decision aids, of which 14 were ultimately included for analysis. The mean grade level readability score calculated by the 4 readability formulas was 11, far exceeding the 6th grade reading level recommended by the National Institutes of Health. The average DISCERN score was 57.6 (SD 6.7), which indicates "good" quality as online health information. The average International Patient Decision Aids Standards v4.0 minimum standards criteria score was 8.3 (SD 1.5), with none meeting all 12 minimum requirements of a patient decision aid. Conclusions: Online patient decision aids for pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, benign prostatic hyperplasia and overactive bladder require a higher reading level than recommended by the National Institutes of Health. While decision aids are acceptable as online health information, none meets all 12 international standards for patient decision aids.

Our objective was to evaluate the quality and safety of an established APP-led AS clinic by comparing outcomes with urologist-led biopsies, defined in terms of adherence to scheduled visits and biopsy complications. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 2,341 consecutive patients treated in an AS clinic at a high-volume referral center between 2000 and 2019. We examined the rate of no-show or same-day cancellation of visits for APPs versus urologists and compared the risk of biopsy complications between these providers. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for repeated visits and biopsies. Results: There were significantly more no-shows at APP visits (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.16-1.70; p <0.001); however, this only amounted to 1 no-show every 41 visits. There was no evidence of increased biopsy complications with APPs (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.05-2.49; p=0.3). Patients were not prospectively assigned to APP or urologist management; therefore, unmeasured patient differences could bias our results. Conclusions: We demonstrated that in an established APP-led AS clinic at a high-volume center, APPs achieved acceptable patient adherence to scheduled visits and biopsy complications. Because patients were not continuously managed by one type of provider, further prospective studies are needed to establish equivalent pathological outcomes in APP-managed AS.

Association of the 2012 American Urological Association Vasectomy Guidelines with National Trends in Vasectomy Followup in the United States	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						vasectomy; infertility; guideline adherence; semen analysis; data analysis	CLEARANCE; IMPACT	Introduction: The American Urological Association Vasectomy Guidelines published in 2012 defined vasectomy success as either azoospermia or rare nonmotile sperm (<= 100,000 nonmotile sperm/ml). We sought to characterize nationwide practice patterns surrounding vasectomy followup before and after publication of the guidelines. Methods: Data were collected using the MarketScan (R) database. We identified men 18 to 64 years old undergoing vasectomy between 2007 and 2015 with at least 12 months of followup to track post-vasectomy semen analysis claims. Demographic data including age, vasectomy provider type and regionality were also queried. We compared the likelihood of men obtaining multiple post-vasectomy semen analyses before vs after the guidelines release with multivariate logistic regression. Linear regression was used examine time to first postvasectomy semen analysis association with observed post-vasectomy semen analysis frequency trends. Results: We identified a total of 87,201 patients who underwent vasectomy between 2007 and 2015 and had at least 1 post-vasectomy semen analysis claim. Men undergoing vasectomy in the post-guideline years of 2013 to 2015 were at lower risk for requiring any repeat post-vasectomy semen analysis (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.66-0.71) and less likely to have had >= 3 post-vasectomy semen analyses (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.77-0.88) than those in the pre-guideline (2007 to 2012) cohort. Mean time to first post-vasectomy semen analysis was shorter in men who submitted multiple analyses (p <0.001). Conclusions: Within a nationally representative patient cohort, men required fewer repeat post-vasectomy semen analyses after publication of the 2012 guidelines. Further research on patient and provider characteristics affecting variations in vasectomy followup patterns and guideline adherence is needed.

In urology, 2 of the guidelines state bone scans and pelvic computerized tomography scans are unnecessary in low risk prostate cancer. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on patients diagnosed with low risk prostate cancer between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2017 at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. All demographics and imaging data were obtained. Patients with symptoms concerning for metastatic disease or with other malignancies were excluded by chart review. Statistical analysis was employed to compare the use of bone scans and computerized tomography scans in this population before and after the Choosing Wisely guidelines were published. Results: Of the 6,996 patients, 121 (1.7%) and 96 (1.4%) underwent a bone scan and computerized tomography scan, respectively. A Cochran-Armitage test showed no change after implementation of the statements. Logistic regression analysis revealed that for every point increase in prostate specific antigen, the odds ratio was 1.09 for ordering both a bone scan and computerized tomography scan. When compared to Whites, the odds ratio of having a bone scan and computerized tomography scan were 0.35 and 0.37 for Blacks, 0.30 and 0.38 for Hispanics, and 0.47 and 0.61 for Asians, respectively. Conclusions: Over the study period, there were low rates of inappropriate imaging for low risk prostate cancer. There was no change in trend after publication of the Choosing Wisely. Higher prostate specific antigen levels and White ethnicity were predictors for ordering inappropriate imaging.

Online Kidney Stone Educational Materials Do Not Meet Recommended Readability Standards	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						kidney calculi; health literacy; comprehension; patient education as topic	FUNCTIONAL HEALTH LITERACY; KNOWLEDGE; DISEASE	Introduction: The prevalence of kidney stones is rising and there is an increasing demand for reliable, easy to understand information for patients. To evaluate the readability of common Internet-based resources for kidney stones, we examined whether the most popular online educational materials may be contributing to decreased health literacy for this chronic condition. Methods: Websites for readability analysis were chosen based on a Google.com search using the search term "kidney stones." The top 10 websites were chosen for analysis and their quality was assessed by the presence or absence of a HONcode certificate. Readability was determined using 6 readability assessment tools: Flesch Reading Ease, FORCAST, Fry, Gunning Fog, Raygor Estimate and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook. Each website was then analyzed by subsections, with emphasis on the treatment and prevention of kidney stones. Results: Of the 10 websites analyzed 8 had HONcode certification. Grade level calculations ranged from 7-13.9. All 10 websites were found to have readability levels above the recommended sixth-grade reading level. Mean Flesch Reading Ease score was 59 (range 47-73). With respect to treatment and prevention sections, 6/10 and 5/10 websites had readability levels above a tenth-grade level, respectively. Conclusions: The most commonly accessed websites regarding kidney stones have readability scores above what is comprehensible to the general public, with most exceeding grade level recommendations from the American Medical Association. Websites pertaining to kidney stones need to be simplified to facilitate patient understanding, especially with respect to the treatment and prevention of kidney stones.

Opioid Prescribing Practices of U.S. Urology Trainees after Urological Surgery	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						analgesics; opioid; practice patterns; physicians'; internship and residency; endoscopy; kidney calculi	PATTERNS; URETEROSCOPY; FEASIBILITY; EFFICACY; PAIN	Introduction: We surveyed U.S. urology trainees to determine current prescribing practices after common endourological procedures. Methods: An institutional review board approved, 22-item survey was distributed to all U.S. urology residents through the Society of Academic Urologists. The survey was divided into demographics including American Urological Association section, prescribing patterns after ureteroscopy, shockwave lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy and transurethral prostate procedures, as well as attitudes surrounding opioid prescription. Results: A total of 148 U.S. urology residents completed the survey (response rate 13%). All American Urological Association sections were represented, including Northeastern (12.8%), New England (8.1%), New York (6.1%), Mid-Atlantic (3.4%), Southeastern (19.6%), North Central (29.05%), South Central (10.1%) and Western (10.8%). By procedure, 72.3% of respondents prescribe opioids after ureteroscopy, 37.8% after shockwave lithotripsy, 93.9% after percutaneous nephrolithotomy, and 53.4% after transurethral prostate procedures. By procedure, the average number of tablets prescribed, were 7.5 (range 0-30) for ureteroscopy, 4.2 (0-20) for shockwave lithotripsy, 14.1 (0-40) for percutaneous nephrolithotomy and 6.7 (0-30) for transurethral prostate procedures. The average number of tablets prescribed by region varied significantly for ureteroscopy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy and transurethral prostate procedures (all p <0.0001), but did not vary significantly for shockwave lithotripsy (p=0.067). Conclusions: Opioid prescribing practices among U.S. urology residents for common urological procedures varied by regional American Urological Association section, and attitudes surrounding opioid dispensing influenced prescription patterns. While attitudes regarding opioid prescriptions after urological surgery are improving, residents may benefit from additional training, best practice policies and/or society guidelines.

J	Hayward, D; de Riese, W; de Riese, C				Hayward, Dan; de Riese, Werner; de Riese, Cornelia			Potential Bias of Patient Payer Category on CG-CAHPS Scores and Its Impact on Physician Reimbursement	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						physicians; insurance; health; reimbursement; patients; bias; insurance	SATISFACTION	Introduction: Patient satisfaction scores play an ever increasing role in physician reimbursement. Positive scores contribute to a physician earning up to 9% reimbursement bonuses, while negative scores may contribute up to 9% reduction in reimbursement. This method of reimbursement modification is already standard within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and is quickly catching on with commercial payers. We suspect patient satisfaction scores will eventually influence reimbursement for all payers. Incentivizing patient satisfaction calls into question whether patient-specific variables exist that inherently impact survey scores without any physician input. Methods: This review specifically assesses the effect insurance status has on CG-CAHPS (R) scores since the survey was first implemented in 2007. Peer-reviewed articles that met inclusion criteria were graded on a scale of 0-3 according to significance of patient bias observed. Results: Commercial insurance and Medicare are associated with higher patient satisfaction survey scores, while Medicaid and Workers' Compensation are associated with lower scores. Conclusions: Because most physicians have no control over the type of insurance that covers their patients, we recommend augmenting reimbursement models to account for payer mix.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients undergoing surgery for testicular masses between 2003 and 2015. We included patients with unilateral testicular tumors, normal preoperative serum tumor markers and no preoperative evidence of metastatic spread. Demographic and clinical information were extracted. The primary outcome studied was tumor pathology, germ cell tumor histology vs nongerm cell histology. We compared patients in these cohorts based on the testicular tumor size. Results: A total of 48 patients met study criteria, 18 (37.5%) of whom had a final pathology consistent with nongerm cell histology. In general, the median tumor size was less in the nongerm cell group (11 mm vs 27 mm, p=0.001). Tumor size less than 2 cm was associated with increased likelihood of nongerm cell histology (p=0.003) with 61.9% of those with tumors less than 2 cm harboring nongerm cell tumors and therefore likely appropriate for organ-sparing surgery. A receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated a maximum sensitivity and specificity for selecting masses with normal tumor markers as having nongerm cell histology at a size cutoff of 18 mm. Conclusions: It appears that a majority of patients with localized small testicular masses and nonelevated tumor markers will have nongerm cell histology, which makes them potentially eligible for testicular sparing surgery at centers with expertise in intraoperative frozen section analysis.

Informing the Management of Asymptomatic Nephrolithiasis: Markov Decision Analysis for the 1 cm Renal Stone	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						ureteroscopy; Markov chains; decision analysis; extracorporeal shockwave therapy; quality-adjusted life years	SHOCK-WAVE LITHOTRIPSY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; NATURAL-HISTORY; KIDNEY-STONES; URETEROSCOPY; PREVALENCE; FRAGMENTS	Introduction: The management of an incidentally discovered, asymptomatic renal stone includes watchful waiting, shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy with basket extraction of fragmented stones (URS-B) or ureteroscopy with laser "dusting" (URS-D). Each intervention has varying stone-free rates, requirements for ureteral stenting, and variable impact on a patient's quality of life. Decision analysis was used to assess the optimal quality adjusted life-years associated with each treatment option. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to represent potential outcomes for a single 1 cm renal stone after treatment. The cohort was followed for 1-month cycles over 3 years and toll penalties for receiving a stent and undergoing surgery were standardized and incorporated into each subtree. Probabilities, utilities and toll penalties were derived from existing literature or clinical extrapolation when no published data were available. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to determine threshold probabilities/utilities that may alter preferred options. Results: Watchful waiting was the preferred intervention, preserving 2.82 quality adjusted life-years over 3 years. The remaining options had similar but decreasing quality adjusted life-years: URS-B provided 2.78 quality adjusted life-years; shock wave lithotripsy provided 2.72 quality adjusted life-years, and URS-D provided 2.67 quality adjusted life-years. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that URS-D was preferred when stone-free rates from URS-B dropped below 37%. Shock wave lithotripsy was preferred over URS-B when stone-free rates from URS-B dropped below 62%. As stents became progressively less bothersome, watchful waiting is preferred, followed by URS-B, shock wave lithotripsy and URS-D. Conclusions: Watchful waiting is the preferred management decision for asymptomatic renal stones. However, these results are sensitive to both actual stone-free rate and individual stent tolerance.

Fusion biopsy has an expanding role at major academic centers. However, the reproducibility of outcomes in the community setting is unknown. Our goal was to determine if there are significant differences in the yield of clinically significant prostate cancer upon implementation of fusion biopsy in the community setting. Methods: We compared biopsy results from the first consecutive 175 patients undergoing fusion biopsy at an academic setting to the first 175 patients undergoing fusion biopsy at a community practice. Patients treated at an academic setting were matched to nonacademic setting treated patients using Mahalonobis distance matching. A treatment effects model was used to evaluate the effect of practice setting on the rate of clinically significant prostate cancer detection. Results: The matching model resulted in 160 community based patients matched to 150 academic based patients. Balance was verified by reduction in standardized differences and variances ratios between samples. Standard errors and the 95% CI were calculated from 3,000 bootstrap samples. Practice setting had no significant effect on clinically significant prostate cancer detection, clinically significant prostate cancer detection by fusion biopsy, upgrading by fusion cores, upgrading by template cores, clinically significant prostate cancer missed by template cores or clinically significant prostate cancer missed by fusion cores. Conclusions: A sample-matched analysis of the first consecutive patients enrolled in fusion biopsy at an academic versus a community setting indicates that practice setting did not have a significant effect on the overall detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.

Methods: Clinical encounters with a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) where cystoscopy with and without hydrodistention was performed were identified in the Vizient (R) Clinical Data Base between January 2009 and February 2020. Demographic and clinical information such as patient age, gender, race, treating physician specialty, insurance type and type of hospital (teaching vs nonteaching) was recorded. Descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon 2-sample test and chi-square test were used to compare variables. An interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the change in CH rate following the June 2011 AUA guideline. Results: From January 2009 to February 2020, 69,983 encounters were identified to have an IC/BPS diagnosis and to have undergone outpatient cystoscopy, of which 7,502 (10.7%) were CH. Compared to those not undergoing CH, subjects with IC/BPS undergoing CH were younger, predominantly female, Caucasian and had commercial insurance. Before the guideline, across all medical specialties, the base rate of CH was rising from 16.6% at a rate of 0.12% per month. Following guideline release, the CH rate dropped by 6.8%, declining 0.07% per month until February 2020. This pattern was most pronounced in urology relative to all other medical specialties. Conclusions: The monthly average rate of CH among individuals with IC/BPS undergoing an outpatient CH dropped from nearly 17% before the 2011 AUA guideline to less than 10% in early 2020.

Predictive Factor of Preresidency Publication on Career Academic Achievement in Urologists	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						publications; financing; oraganized; publishing; schools; medical; intership and residency	MEDICAL-STUDENT RESEARCH; PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS; RESEARCH TRAINING LEAD; RESIDENT CHOICE; PRODUCTIVITY; SUCCESS	Introduction: Publications at any point in training can impact future academic interest and achievement. Implications of publishing scholarly work prior to residency on accomplishments during and after residency are understudied. Methods: We obtained publication output before, during and after residency for urologists graduating between 2002 and 2008 from the 36 training programs affiliated with a top 50 urology hospital nationwide. Additional collected information included fellowship training, current appointment, total and R01 National Institutes of Health grants, and h-index. We compared urologists' preresidency scholarship with residency and career achievements. Results: We retrieved data from 543 urologists, of whom 161 (29.7%) and 92 (16.9%) published 1 or more total and first author manuscripts before residency, respectively. A total of 269 (49.5%) urologists went on to pursue fellowship and 183 (33.7%) entered academic practice. Urologists with a first author publication before residency had increased odds of entering academics (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.1), obtaining National Institutes of Health grants (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.3) and acquiring National Institutes of Health R01 grants (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.7-9.7). Those with more first author manuscripts prior to residency were also more likely to pursue fellowship (p=0.0002), have a higher h-index (p <0.0001) and publish more during (p <0.0001) and after residency (p=0.0002). However, those with more total publications before residency were only associated with greater h-index (p=0.002) and publications in residency (p=0.001). Conclusions: Preresidency scholarly endeavors, particularly first author publications, are associated with future scholarly achievement, which may inform both resident selection procedures and medical education curricular development.

Characteristics of Participants in the American Urological Association Quality (AQUA) Registry and Early Impact of Participation on Quality of Care	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						health services; quality of health care; urology; registries; electronic health records	RECOMMENDATIONS	Introduction: The American Urological Association Quality Registry (AQUA) is an approved Qualified Clinical Data Repository that was created in 2013 to serve as a platform of quality assessment and improvement. Little is known about how such specialty specific platforms are adopted and used. We describe AQUA participants and report early impact on quality metrics. Methods: We compared characteristics of practices and urologists participating in AQUA from 2014-2017 to those of the broader urologist workforce as reported in the 2017 American Urological Association Census, and examined pass rates of 4 measures reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services after participation in AQUA. Results: Participation increased during the first 4 years and included >125 practices and 1,148 urologists (9.2% of practicing U.S. urologists). Of AQUA participants 97.6% were in private practice, 1.9% were in academic practice and the rest (0.5%) were employed by private or public hospitals, compared to 59.1%, 25.5% and 11.2%, respectively, of urologists nationally. Among AQUA participants 95.9% lived in metropolitan areas, compared to 89.9% of urologists nationally. A total of 17 quality measures were reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services through AQUA, of which 4 were urology specific and 13 were crosscutting. The average pass rate across the 4 select urological measures was 31.1% prior to AQUA dashboard access and 48.8% after access was gained, a 56.9% improvement (17.1% absolute difference). Conclusions: Early participants in AQUA were mostly community practitioners. Participation in AQUA seemed to facilitate quality score improvements, although whether this was due to improved measurement vs clinical care is unknown at this time.	[Shelton, J. B.; Wood, E.

A New Paradigm for Outpatient Diagnosis and Treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Utilizing a Mobile App/Software Platform and Remote and In-Office Visits: A Feasibility Study	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						mobile applications; diary; questionnaire; patient reported outcome measures; remote consultation; telemedicine	HEALTH; TELEMEDICINE; VALIDATION; CARE	Introduction: This pilot/feasibility study evaluated a new diagnostic and treatment paradigm for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms using a software platform comprised of a mobile app, validated patient reported outcome questionnaires, bladder diaries and remote patient monitoring. Methods: New urology referrals for lower urinary tract symptoms completed validated lower urinary tract symptoms questionnaires and 24-hour bladder diaries on a mobile app. Patients were triaged based on symptom severity into an urgent or routine office visit or a remote visit. Outcome metrics assessed include acceptability, practicality, implementation and integration. Results: Of 500 urology consults there were 226 (45%) patients with new lower urinary tract symptoms referrals of whom 201 (89%) had email addresses. In all there were 182 men and 19 women, aged 18 to 87 years (mean 59, SD 17), of whom 71/201 (35%) registered, 57/71 (80%) completed the app and 41/57 (72%) elected remote visits. Mean time from urology referral to initiation of a remote or in-office diagnostic and treatment plan was 7.4 days (SD 5.9) and 7.7 days (SD 7.6), respectively. Conclusions: Of patients who completed the app 72% were triaged to a remote visit. Time from urology referral to initiation of remote or in-office diagnostic and treatment plan averaged 1 week. This paradigm for management of lower urinary tract symptoms has potential to optimize the clinical workflow, improve health care outcomes and reduce costs.	[Li, Eric S.

We designed and implemented a simulation curriculum for urology residents. The objective of this study was to assess its impact on trainee confidence and knowledge. Methods: This was a prospective nonblinded case series analyzing the use of simulation education with entrance and exit surveys. We developed and implemented monthly workshops featuring fundamental urological procedures and skills. Residents from a single academic urology residency program received didactic instruction as well as supervised simulation training from an expert faculty member. Results: The majority of residents highly rated all topics and affirmed that they would repeat the simulation topic in the future. Overall, junior residents averaged a 27% gain in base knowledge (p <0.001), and senior residents reported a 15.5% gain in base knowledge (p <0.001). Didactic and mentored simulation portions of the sessions were considered equally valuable (p >0.5). Of the residents 84% felt the sessions better prepared them to be in the operating room and 94% reported that they would recommend the simulation sessions to a peer (p <0.001). Conclusions: Simulation is a valuable tool that prepares residents for operating room experiences. We have developed a robust simulation curriculum that serves as a feasible and valuable model for other training programs, and has led to increased resident confidence and knowledge in urological procedures and skills.

In an attemp to reduce transmission, patients were advised to avoid in-person medical evaluations when possible. Accordingly, we hypothesize that fewer patients have sought care and undergone treatment for emergent urological conditions such as nephrolithiasis. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing emergent ureteral stent placement for obstructive nephrolithiasis from March 15, 2020 through May 31, 2020 and compared them to similar patients from a year earlier. We found that notably fewer patients underwent emergent stent placement during the COVID-19 era and that these patients were notably sicker. These findings suggest that indirect sequelae of the pandemic include delays in seeking care for conditions unrelated to the virus. Strategies such as increased use of in-office stenting and improved patient counseling may help reduce delays in care and improve clinical outcomes for patients with nephrolithiasis during subsequent peaks in the ongoing pandemic.

Washington State Surgeon Perspectives on Quality Measures in the Surgical Care of Stress Urinary Incontinence in Women	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						urinary incontinence,stress; quality of healthcare; treatment outcome	PREVALENCE	Introduction: No consensus exists on outcomes that define high quality care in female stress urinary incontinence management. A working group of surgeons from diverse health care settings in Washington State who treat stress urinary incontinence was convened through a state level quality collaborative. Preliminary questions were developed and focus groups conducted to obtain surgeon input and perspectives on stress urinary incontinence surgery quality measures to guide future research. Methods: Washington State surgeons who perform sling surgery were recruited via email. Focus groups were convened via teleconference using preliminary questions as discussion points. Participants were surgeons from a variety of locations and practice types. Focus groups were led by a trained moderator, recorded and transcribed verbatim, and qualitatively analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results: Eight urologists and 6 gynecologists from 5 academic, 4 private practice and 5 hospital based settings participated in 3 focus groups. The 4 emergent concepts derived, were a perceived need to individualize rather than standardize the management approach to recurrent and persistent stress urinary incontinence, a need to establish and validate shared decision making tools for synthetic mesh procedures, a need to define risk factors and treatment strategies for unique populations, including those with mixed urinary incontinence, younger patients and those with concomitant prolapse, and an enthusiasm to identify practical and clinically meaningful quality measures. Conclusions: Focus groups with clinical experts on quality of stress urinary incontinence care identified several priority topics for future study. Further work is needed to refine research prioritization on this important area of women's health.

Results: Of the 29,192 men surveyed 1,043 (3.6%) reported undergoing a vasectomy. Of the men reporting vasectomy, 4.4% (95% CI 3.2-6.0) underwent the procedure without having had children. Compared to men with children, men without children were less likely to have ever been married and were more likely to not identify with any religion. Whereas 1.2% (95% CI 0.5-2.4) of men with children underwent vasectomy reversal during the followup, 0% of men without children underwent reversal. Conclusions: Men who undergo vasectomy without having children constitute a small but distinct population of men. During 7-year followup after vasectomy, men who have not fathered children do not express higher rates of postvasectomy regret.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of a prospectively maintained IRB-approved LRM database. The database was queried for patients treated with microwave ablation or partial nephrectomy from 2015 to 2020. Allocated costs related to the procedural encounter and related to complications were collected. Allocated cost was calculated using ratio of cost-to-charges cost accounting methodology. Total cost was the sum of medical center cost and physician related cost. Statistical analysis was performed in SAS using Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: A total of 279 patients were identified, of whom 165 underwent percutaneous MWA and 114 underwent RA-PN. All partial nephrectomies were robot-assisted. The mean total cost was $20,536 for RA-PN and $6,470 for percutaneous MWA (p <0.0001). Five patients (3%) who underwent MWA and 7 (6%) who underwent RA-PN experienced complications. Patients who underwent MWA and did not have a major complication had an average medical center cost of $5,174, compared to $8,990 for those with a major complication (p=0.36). Among patients who underwent RA-PN, those who did not have a major complication had an average medical center cost of $15,138, compared to $28,940 for those who did have a major complication (p=0.008). Conclusions: MWA demonstrates lower perioperative cost and lower cost of complications than RA-PN for treatment of LRM. Further cost-effectiveness studies for LRM treatment should be performed with this updated cost information.

Houston			A Survey of Urology Residency Program Directors Assessing Criteria to Interview Applicants during the COVID-19 Pandemic	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						urology; internship and residency; COVID-19; interview	MEDICAL-SCHOOL; PREDICTORS	Introduction: We aimed to determine criteria of interest to urology residency program directors when selecting applicants for residency interviews during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An anonymous survey was sent via email to all urology residency program directors across the United States. Program directors were asked to assign the degree of importance (1-5, with 5 being very important) of selected factors in deciding which applicants to interview. Surveys were distributed and study data were managed using REDCap. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Results: In total, 130 urology residency program directors were contacted and 64 (49.3%) responded to the survey. Urology letter(s) of recommendation based on nonvirtual rotation(s), urology clerkship grades, research experience, and visa status of the applicant were cited as the most important factors in selecting applicants for interview with median importance ratings of 5, 4, 4, and 5, respectively. Urology letter(s) of recommendation based on virtual rotation(s), virtual subinternship(s), and participation in social media activities were the least important in selecting applicants for interviews with median importance ratings of 2 for each. Notably, urology letter(s) of recommendation based on nonvirtual rotation(s) and visa status were consistently ranked as the most important factors by more than 50% of program directors. Conclusions: Urology program directors value urology letter(s) of recommendation from non-virtual rotation(s), urology clerkship grades, research experience, and applicant visa status as the most important factors in selecting applicants for interviews during the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual rotation( s) and social media activity were ranked the lowest among criteria that influence the selection process for interviews.

Initial Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy versus Ureteroscopy: A Re-treatment and Cost Analysis Using a Longitudinal, Population-Based Database	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	114th Annual Meeting of the American-Urological-Association (AUA)	MAY 03-06, 2019	Chicago, IL	Amer Urol Assoc		lithotripsy; ureteroscopy; cost-benefit analysis	RETROGRADE INTRARENAL SURGERY; WAVE LITHOTRIPSY; PERCUTANEOUS NEPHROLITHOTOMY; URETERAL CALCULI; RENAL STONES; METAANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT	Introduction: We sought to compare re-treatment rates between shockwave lithotripsy and ureteroscopy to evaluate the effectiveness of these modalities. Additionally, we aimed to compare costs associated with re-treatment. Methods: The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Ambulatory Surgery Database for Florida from 2009 to 2015 was used to identify patients who underwent shockwave lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. Patients were tracked for subsequent stone surgeries within 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. Costs of care were estimated and descriptive analyses were performed. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine predictors of a second procedure. Results: A total of 98,011 patients underwent initial shockwave lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. Of those who underwent initial shockwave lithotripsy 21.2% had a second surgery (shockwave lithotripsy or ureteroscopy) within 3 months compared to 10% of patients who underwent initial ureteroscopy (p <0.01). On multivariable analysis, patients who underwent initial shockwave lithotripsy were more than twice as likely (OR 2.4, 95% CI 2.3-2.5) to undergo a second procedure within 3 months. Older patients were also more likely to undergo a second surgery, while African Americans, Hispanics, uninsured patients and patients with more comorbidities had decreased odds of undergoing a second surgery (all p <0.05). The per patient cost of the initial procedure plus re-treatment at the 3-month mark was $6,239 for initial shockwave lithotripsy and $5,319 for initial ureteroscopy (p <0.01). Conclusions: Patients undergoing shockwave lithotripsy are more likely than those undergoing ureteroscopy to have additional stone procedures, making shockwave lithotripsy a more expensive intervention.

We evaluated the potential of an examination based tumor staging template embedded within the electronic medical record to improve consistency and clarity of clinical tumor staging. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis before template implementation (January to March 2017), followed by prospective analysis after implementation (April to August 2017). Physicians were educated on use and importance of the staging template prior to implementation. Assessment of digital rectal examination clarity included confident-explicit (cT stage documented), confident-implicit (stage inexplicit, cT stage interpreted) and unconfident (inability to discern cT stage). Clarity and consistency of tumor staging before and after template implementation were compared using a chi-square test. Results: A total of 573 biopsies were analyzed: 234 before template use (40%) and 339 after (60%). In men at risk for prostate cancer explicit staging increased from 16% to 60% (p <0.001) following implementation of the staging template. Overall staging (explicit plus implicit) increased (from 74% to 92%, p <0.001), while unconfident staging decreased (from 26% to 8%, p <0.001) after implementation. In men with positive biopsies (309) explicit staging increased (from 29% to 64%, p <0.001) and overall staging increased (from 76% to 92%, p <0.001), while unconfident staging decreased (from 24% to 8%, p <0.001). Conclusions: Accurate prostate cancer clinical staging is important in risk stratification and treatment. We demonstrate the ability of a standardized, electronic medical record embedded, American Joint Committee on Cancer based template to improve the consistency and clarity of clinical staging in prostate cancer.

The aim of this study was to describe development, implementation and outcomes of a newborn circumcision clinic for boys where concern about anatomical circumcision suitability exists. Methods: The workflow of a pediatric urology outpatient clinic was modified and a circumcision clinic implemented. Staff educational materials and electronic medical record referral templates were created. Circumcision suitability was assessed via checklist, and suitable patients circumcised on the same day. Clinical data were reviewed to evaluate initial implementation and patient outcomes. Results: Of 833 boys evaluated from January 2014 to April 2018, 657 (79%) were suitable to circumcise, all of whom underwent a circumcision. Of those suitable 244 (37%) had normal anatomy. The remaining 413 (63%) had minor anatomical abnormalities, most commonly penoscrotal web (297/657, 45%) and penile raphe deviation (60/657, 9%). No short-term complications were noted. Most (595/657, 91%) returned for followup within 6 weeks after circumcision. Success was achieved in 593/595 boys (99.7%), and 2 boys (0.3%) required acquired buried penis repair. Of the 176 boys with anatomy unsuitable for clamp circumcision (buried penis, chordee or hypospadias), 144/176 (82%) elected for surgical reconstruction. Conclusions: Implementing a newborn circumcision clinic for boys with possible anatomical abnormalities is feasible. Most boys are circumcised safely and successfully without general anesthesia. Operative circumcision under general anesthesia is reserved for boys requiring surgical reconstruction for significant anatomical abnormalities.

Methods: A decision tree model compared cost of biopsy for all men with previous negative biopsy and rising prostate specific antigen (standard arm) vs initial IsoPSA with biopsies performed only in cases of abnormal IsoPSA. Study endpoints were cost, number of biopsies and cancers detected. Cost was based on Medicare reimbursement and peer reviewed literature. Cost of sepsis, complications and loss of work were incorporated into the analysis. Sensitivity analyses were performed varying model assumptions. A separate analysis incorporated cost of treatment for patients with cancer. Results: Using the baseline model with 20.5% prostate cancer incidence yielded an overall cost for 100 men of $197,700 and $165,300 for the standard and IsoPSA arms, respectively, including the cost of the IsoPSA assay, herein assumed to be $350. The IsoPSA arm detected 0.8 fewer Gleason 7-10 prostate cancers (12.6 vs 13.4) but generated 34% fewer biopsies. The IsoPSA arm was less expensive if overall biopsy cost is more than $1,027, if IsoPSA cost is less than $674 or cancer rate was less than 70%. In the model incorporating treatment of men with a cancer diagnosis the IsoPSA arm was also less expensive, generating savings of $53,300 per 100 men. Conclusions: The use of IsoPSA to select patients for repeat biopsy reduced the number of biopsies needed by 34% and generated significant cost savings.

J	Kraft, H; Colon-Sanchez, K; Ellsworth, P				Kraft, Heather; Colon-Sanchez, Kaity; Ellsworth, Pamela			Neonatal Circumcision Trends from a Pediatric Urology Perspective: Results from a Survey of Members of the Societies for Pediatric Urology	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						circumcision; male; urology; infant; newborn		Introduction: Neonatal circumcision remains controversial, with rates varying over the years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics acknowledge the health benefits of neonatal circumcision and support access to the procedure for families who choose it. Although more commonly performed by nonurological providers, pediatric urologists are often involved with pre-procedural or post-procedural concerns. Neonatal circumcision trends and perspectives were evaluated as determined by members of the Societies for Pediatric Urology nationwide. Methods: A 20-question survey was distributed electronically via SurveyMonkey to members of the Societies for Pediatric Urology. The survey was developed to assess pediatric urologists' roles in and criteria for neonatal circumcision as well as attitudes towards nonurological provider circumcisions. Of the 20 questions 16 formed the basis of this study. Four questions evaluated "perceptions" and were excluded from study analysis due to subjectivity. Results: Of the surveys 223 (37.2%) were returned. Most responders (80.1%, 177) perform neonatal circumcision. Significant differences exist across geographical regions nationally including common practices, techniques, and financial coverage of neonatal circumcision. However, 70.6% of responders noted a maximum age at time of circumcision of 12 weeks or younger and 48.9% noted a maximum weight of 12 pounds (5.44 kilograms) or less. Conclusions: This study assessed pediatric urologists' roles in and criteria for neonatal circumcision. The development of universal best practices as determined by pediatric urologists, as experts in the field, may prove beneficial for optimizing patient care and nonurological circumcision provider education and training.

Advanced analytics are rarely applied to address operational challenges in health care. We sought to develop a machine learning model that predicts the time pediatric urologists require to create a more efficient clinic schedule. Methods: We prospectively collected data from January to April 2018. Variables included demographics and visit level covariates. The primary outcome was defined as in-room doctor time spent. Univariate analysis was performed. Data were split into train/test in a 4:1 ratio. Separate models using random forest were created for new and return visits. Two out-of-sample clinic days were used to compare the patient wait time between fixed-time visits and machine learning model. Patient punctuality simulation was performed 1,000 times for each day. Results: A total of 256 visits (113 new/143 return) were included. Mean age at visit was 6.47 years. In univariate analysis, longer visits were significantly associated with new patients (p <0.01), testing (p <0.01), older patients and diagnoses like voiding dysfunction and neurogenic bladder. Conversely, morning clinic, previous urological surgery (p <0.01), recent postoperation (p <0.01) and diagnoses like penile complaints and hydrocele were associated with shorter visits. On average, our machine learning model predicted doctor time accurately to 3.6 (new patients) and 5.0 minutes (returning patients). In 1,000 simulated days with random patient punctuality machine learning reduced the wait time by 24% to 54%. Conclusions: Pediatric urologists' clinic time can be accurately predicted with machine learning models. This insight can be incorporated into a robust scheduling model to minimize patient wait time, increase clinical efficiency and likely improve family satisfaction.

Patient Perpetrated Sexual Harassment of Urologists: A Survey Based Study	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						urology; sexual harassment; health policy; workforce	ABUSE	Introduction: Patient perpetrated sexual harassment has been studied with family physicians, surgical residents and dermatologists with the prevalence ranging from 27% to 77%. To our knowledge this phenomenon has not yet been studied in urology. Methods: We surveyed urologists in the United States about their age, employment/training status and their experiences of patient perpetrated sexual harassment. Surveys were anonymous and hosted on a web based platform. Pearson chi-square analysis was used to assess risk factors and descriptive statistics were used to describe prevalence. Results: A total of 190 urologists completed the survey. Patient perpetrated sexual harassment was reported by 49.5% of respondents. Women were more likely to report patient perpetrated sexual harassment when compared with men, at 69% and 23%, respectively (p <0.0001). Being a resident/fellow portended higher rates of patient perpetrated sexual harassment compared to staff/attendings, at 69% and 44%, respectively (p=0.004). Respondents 40 years or younger were more likely to have reported patient perpetrated sexual harassment when compared to those 41 years old or older, at 65% and 39%, respectively (p=0.001). Conclusions: The results of this survey study suggest that the prevalence of patient perpetrated sexual harassment in the field of urology may be high. Professional societies should perform further investigation into this matter. We suggest proactive development of guidelines and protocols to address patient perpetrated sexual harassment in urology.

Failure to Attend Urology Appointments: A Retrospective Analysis of a Single Urban Academic Practice	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						no-show patients; urology; appointments and schedules; practice management	NO-SHOW; FOLLOW-UP; VISITS; CARE	Introduction: We sought to examine why patients miss appointments in a large academic urology practice. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 83,983 patient appointments in our faculty urology group between May 1, 2017 and December 1, 2020. Appointment data from 17 providers were included. Data were collected on diagnosis, age, gender, insurance type, nonattendance history, lead time between scheduling and appointment, clinic location and outpatient procedures vs general office visit or telehealth visit. Results: A total of 7,592 (9.0%) appointments were missed. Patients seen for oncologic diagnosis had the lowest missed appointment rate (4.5%), as compared with benign urology (9.6%) and pediatrics (13.0%). Previous nonattendance history within the last year was associated with nonattendance again (OR 2.47, 95% CI 2.29-2.66). Patients with Medicaid had the highest rate of missed appointments (17.2%; OR 2.16, 95% CI 2.02-2.32). Increased lead time between appointments increased the odds of nonattendance (OR 1.018/week, CI 1.016-1.020). Patients undergoing procedures had the lowest nonattendance rate (3.4%), compared with both new (11.4%) and followup (10.5%) visits, while both telephone (2.9%; OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.32-0.53) and video (2.8%; OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.71) visits had lower rates of nonattendance when compared to inperson visits. Conclusions: We found a nonattendance rate of 9% in our practice. Those patients with oncologic diagnoses and those having procedures or telemedicine visits had the lowest rates. Those who have missed an appointment in the past are at the highest risk nonattendance and should be targeted to improve patient health as well as practice efficiency.

Underutilization of Surgical Standard of Care for Insured Men with Invasive Penile Cancer	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						penile neoplasms; standard of care; lymph node excision; healthcare disparities; urologic surgical procedures, male	PROSTATE-CANCER; DISPARITIES	Introduction: Prior studies of mixed insurance populations have demonstrated poor adherence to surgical standard of care for penile cancer. We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry linked to Medicare to calculate standard of care adherence to surgical treatment of penile cancer in insured men over the age of 65, focusing on potential social and racial disparities. Methods: This is an observational analysis of patients with T2-4 penile cancer of any histologic subtype without metastasis in the SEER-Medicare database (2004-2015). Standard of care was defined as penectomy (partial or radical) with bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. We calculated proportions of those receiving standard of care and constructed multivariate models to identify factors associated with receiving standard of care. Results: A total of 447 men were included. Of these men 22.1% (99/447) received standard of care while 18.8% (84/447) received no treatment at all. Only 23.3% (104/447) had inguinal lymph node dissection while 80.9% (362/447) underwent total or partial penectomy. Race and socioeconomic status were not associated with decreased standard of care. Increasing age (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.96), Charlson Comorbidity Index score >= 2 (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.97) and T3 to T4 disease (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18-0.65) were associated with not receiving standard of care on adjusted analysis. Conclusions: Rates of standard of care are low among insured men 65 years of age or older with invasive penile cancer, regardless of race or socioeconomic status. This finding is largely driven by low rates of inguinal lymph node dissection. Strategies are needed to overcome barriers to standard of care treatment for men with invasive penile cancer.

Methods: Veterans Health Affairs electronic medical records were used to analyze 240 men treated for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy plus either docetaxel ("docetaxel cohort," 208 patients, selected to be overrepresented, July 2014 to August 2018) or abiraterone ("abiraterone cohort," 32 patients, December 2016 to September 2018) who received at least 1 treatment after progressing to castrate resistance. Results: For docetaxel and abiraterone cohorts, respectively, mean age at androgen deprivation therapy initiation was 65 and 72 years, and median followup was 2.2 and 1.4 years. Overall, the maximum number of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer treatment lines was 6; 106 patients (44%) had 1, 71 (30%) had 2, and 63 (26%) had 3 or more lines. Most patients received an androgen receptor targeted agent for initial metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer treatment (94% vs 78% in docetaxel vs abiraterone cohort). Androgen receptor targeted agents were given consecutively to 62% of the docetaxel cohort receiving second line therapy, and to 78% of the abiraterone cohort. Across all metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer treatment lines 72 (30%) received a taxane (47 docetaxel and 41 cabazitaxel). Conclusions: Most patients received androgen receptor targeted agents as first metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer treatment regardless of initial metastatic hormone-sensitive treatment. Moreover, a large proportion were treated with consecutive androgen receptor targeted agents. Given recent evidence suggesting poorer outcomes with this treatment in some patients, longer followup is needed to assess the association between treatment sequence and optimal outcomes.

Evaluating the Quality of Online Health Information about Prostate Cancer Treatment	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						prostatic neoplasms; Internet; comprehension	PATIENTS EXPERIENCE; READABILITY; WEBSITES	Introduction: Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men. It is common for patients to search the Internet before and after urological consultation to better understand their diagnoses. Unfortunately, online health information is largely unregulated and may be difficult for patients to comprehend. This study aims to evaluate the readability and quality of websites describing prostate cancer treatments. Methods: Three search engines were used to search the terms "prostate cancer" and "prostate cancer treatments" to replicate a patient seeking self-education about prostate cancer; 40 websites were identified. After excluding websites with membership fees and publicly editable content, 26 websites were analyzed; 7 were marked as advertisements. Three readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease, Simple Measure of Gobbledygook) were used to generate readability scores. The DISCERN standardized questionnaire was used to evaluate website quality. Results: Compared to readability scores at the American Medical Association recommended seventh grade reading level, mean readability scores for the websites analyzed were significantly higher and translated to the tenth to eleventh grade reading level. The mean DISCERN score for all websites was 47, equating to "Fair" quality. Nonadvertisement websites had significantly higher scores than websites marked as advertisements, with nonadvertisements rated "Good" quality and advertisements rated "Poor" quality. Conclusions: Most websites about prostate cancer treatment are written at a reading level too advanced for a large proportion of Americans to understand. Some optimally positioned websites are advertisements that contain poor quality information. It is the responsibility of clinicians to guide their patients toward appropriate online resources.

Male Infertility Websites: What are Our Patients Reading?	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						internet; infertility,male; consumer health information; urology	INFORMATION; QUALITY; FERTILITY; INTERNET; SOCIETY; MEN	Introduction: People of reproductive age (20-45 years) turn to the Internet for health information more often than do adults older than the age of 45. We sought to assess the readability and quality of male infertility websites. Methods: After querying Google for "male infertility," 4 reviewers classified and analyzed the top 60 results. Website information quality was evaluated using the Health on the Net code (HONcode) accreditation status, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria, and DISCERN score. We assessed readability using Flesch Reading Ease and Dale-Chall indexes. Results: The DISCERN score average was 44 +/- 12 (out of a maximum of 80). A total of 60% (36/60) of websites scored a 1, 2 or 3 ("poor quality"). JAMA criteria were met by 4/60 (6.7%) websites. The mean Dale-Chall score was 9.53 +/- 1.30 and the mean Flesch Reading Ease index was 34.01 +/- 16.26. Of the websites 20% (12/60) were HONcode certified. Conclusions: Only 6.7% of male infertility websites satisfied JAMA benchmark criteria. Treatment information was nominal, with only 5% describing risks and 25% discussing benefits. Less than 30% of websites encouraged shared decision making despite requiring a college to graduate degree reading level.

The Impact of Stricter Guidelines on Post-Interview Contact, Restricted Interview Topics and Differences by Gender in the Urology Match	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						guidelines as topic; interviews as topic; internship and residency; urology	POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL QUESTIONS; APPLICANTS; PREVALENT	Introduction: In response to studies showing high rates of program initiated post-interview contact and the use of discriminatory personal questions on topics such as age, intent for children, and religion or political preferences during interviews the Society of Academic Urologists and the American Urological Association published revised guidelines for the 2020 Urology Match. This study assessed the impact of these changes on the applicant experience and prevalence of restricted questions. Methods: A total of 361 applicants to a single urology residency program were sent an anonymous 20-question survey about post-interview program contact and restricted interview questions. The 20-question survey used branching logic with followup questions based on initial responses. Results: A total of 100 survey responses were received. Of respondents 2% reported unsolicited program initiated post-interview contact and no Match commitments were reported. Among respondents 36% felt they were asked an inappropriate question during an interview, female applicants more commonly than males (50% vs 25%, p=0.01). When asked about specific restricted topics, 98% of respondents reported encountering at least 1. Of the restricted topics asked women more frequently encountered questions about their intent for children (27.3% vs 10.7%, p=0.032) and other programs to which they applied (100% vs 91%, p=0.04). Conclusions: Following changes to the guidelines for the 2020 Urology Match unsolicited program initiated post-interview contact rates were lower than reported in previous studies. However, applicants continue to encounter restricted topics, and females disproportionately so, demonstrating that continued work must be done to decrease discrimination and bias throughout the interview process.

Predictors of Compliance with Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Quality Measures and its Effect on Survival Outcomes	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						outcome assessment; health care; urinary bladder neoplasms; survival rate	LONG-TERM OUTCOMES; NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY; ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY; RADICAL CYSTECTOMY; RADIATION-THERAPY; MODALITY THERAPY; SURVEILLANCE; LYMPHADENECTOMY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; IMPACT	Introduction: To assess and improve quality of care, the Commission on Cancer developed 3 evidence-based quality measures for the treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer. We sought to assess performance of these measures prior to their implementation, whether compliance was associated with survival and whether patient factors influenced compliance. Methods: We assessed all patients 18 to 90 years old diagnosed with invasive, nonmetastatic bladder cancer between 2004 and 2015 using the National Cancer Database. Both univariable and multivariable analyses were utilized to determine the effect of compliance on survival and identify patient level predictors of compliance. Results: Of the 46,502 patients identified 22,218 underwent surgical management and 5,282 received trimodal therapy. All quality measures were achieved in 45.7% of the surgical cohort, which was associated with lower all cause mortality (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.85-0.93, p <0.01). Time less than 90 days to trimodal therapy was achieved in 35.0% and was not associated with lower all cause mortality (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85-1.01, p=0.07). In the surgical cohort compliance was associated with higher income (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.13-1.46, p <0.01), living in a higher educated zip code area (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.30, p=0.02) and living 10 or more miles from the place of treatment (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.29-1.47, p <0.01). Conclusions: Quality measure compliance is associated with improved survival in patients undergoing surgical management of muscle invasive bladder cancer. Despite this benefit, achievement of all 3 metrics was observed in less than half of patients prior to quality measure implementation.

Use of Antimicrobial-Coated Catheters in Preventing Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections and Bacteriuria: A Meta-Analysis for Clinicians	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						urinary catheters; urinary tract infections; anti-infective agents; primary prevention	SHORT-TERM CATHETERIZATION; FOLEY CATHETER; EFFICACY; MECHANISM; COATINGS; HISTORY; SAFETY; TRIAL	Introduction: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections comprise a significant burden to the health care system and are of major concern for indwelling catheter use. Catheter coatings have been studied for their potential to reduce risk of infection. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to determine the efficacy of coated catheters across clinical studies in preventing these common nosocomial infections. Methods: Searches were conducted on PubMed Central (R) and ScienceDirect using the terms "catheter," "urinary tract infection" and "coated" or "antimicrobial." Articles included were prospective randomized clinical studies of coated (experimental) vs uncoated (control) catheters published in English between the years 2000 and 2020. Results from included studies were analyzed using Fisher's exact test and conditional logistic regression. Results: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Tested urinary catheter coatings include silver, silver salt, nitrofurazone and metal-alloy. Conditional logistic regression (p <0.001) shows statistically significant negative association between coated catheter use and the incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infections. The odds ratio of 0.80 and 95% confidence interval (0.74, 0.88) support protective effect of catheter coatings. Conclusions: Meta-analysis demonstrates a negative association of coated catheter and incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infections, supporting that antimicrobial catheter coatings decreases incidence of infection across studies. Further clinical research is recommended to determine the potential for catheter coating adoption in clinical practice to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infection risk and incidence.

We hypothesized that using return on invested capital operational mapping combined with a Monte Carlo simulation financial model could accurately predict institutional costs and operational metrics within an outpatient urology clinic. Methods: A process map of a typical outpatient clinic visit was developed, and time studies were performed by following a sample of patients while considering all operational and financial variables that contributed to patient care. this process map was adapted into a return on invested capital-tree for financial modeling. Stochastic modeling using Monte Carlo simulation was performed to estimate financial metrics based on these operational and financial inputs for both the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 fiscal years. These were then compared to the actual performance measures of those fiscal years. Results: Combined return on invested capital-Monte Carlo simulation modeling generated financial and operational estimates that characterized the clinic's performance based on multivariable inputs. Most financial estimates for 2017-2018 differed by <4.31% from the actual financial values from that year. In predicting financial performance for 2018-2019, most of the estimated values were <7.67% different from their actual financial statement line items. Conclusions: As a proof of concept, this study demonstrated that a combined return on invested capital-operational mapping and Monte Carlo simulation modeling can predict key financial metrics in a tertiary care clinic. As such, common business tools can be useful in a health care setting when clinicians are evaluating how investments in quality improvement will influence their financial and operational performance.

Quentin			Patient Reported Shared Decision Making in Urology from the Surgical Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Survey	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						decision making; shared; health care surveys; patient satisfaction	AIDS	Introduction: Shared decision making balances the best available evidence with patients' preferences and values in order to make a medical decision. The use of shared decision making and its link to clinically meaningful outcomes are not well described in urology. We report the rates of shared decision making among patients undergoing urological surgery, and explore the relationship between shared decision making and patient reported surgeon ranking. Methods: This study uses Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Provider and Systems Surgical Care Survey data from patients undergoing urological surgery between 2011 and 2013. A shared decision making composite score was created from the sum of 3 survey items. We fit an ordinal logistic regression model to evaluate factors that influence patients' overall shared decision making score. In a separate model, we evaluated how shared decision making and use of decision aid impact patients' ranking of surgeons. Results: In this sample, 430 (33.8%) surveys were returned. Of respondents, 71% scored maximum points on the shared decision making composite score and 59% reported that their surgeon used a decision aid. Discussing alternative treatment options was the most often omitted step in shared decision making. Patients who report use of a decision aid had nearly double the odds of self-reported shared decision making (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.10-3.06, p=0.02). Shared decision making or decision aid use was not associated with patient reported surgeon ranking. Conclusions: The majority of patients reported shared decision making and decision aid use during preoperative counseling. Patients reporting decision aid use had nearly double the odds of reporting shared decision making. There was no correlation between either shared decision making or decision aid use and patients' ranking of their surgeon.	[Lane, Giulia, I; Ellimoottil, Chad; Wallner, Lauren; Clemens, J.

We trialed the Axis (TM) single-use ureteroscope, which is distributed within the United States by Dornier MedTech. Our goal was to demonstrate clinical equivalence to our reusable platform and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a single-use digital ureteroscope. Methods: We conducted a prospective 90-day trial where all flexible ureteroscopic procedures were completed using the single-use ureteroscope. The cases were monitored for scope failure, scope deficiencies and surgeon satisfaction scores via an immediate postoperative REDCap (R) survey. We also performed a cost analysis between reusable scopes and the single-use ureteroscope. The cost of the reusable platform included the amortized initial purchase, maintenance and clean processing. Results: Over a 90-day period, we performed 93 flexible ureteroscopy procedures with a single-use ureteroscope, of which 74 were completed using Axis. After controlling for operating room time and disposable items used, the utilization of Axis was associated with an average reduction of $140.31 per case. Extrapolating the per-case savings over an annual case volume, we estimate a total savings of $56,127.15. There were no disposable scope malfunctions. There were 4 (4.3%) cases converted to reusable scopes due to image quality (1), inadequate secondary deflection (2) and a tight ureter (1). Mean +/- SD score for image quality, mobility and ergonomics was 9.1 +/- 1.1, 8.9 +/- 1.1, 9.3 +/- 1.1, respectively. The 90-day complication rates were equal to our controls. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the Axis single-use digital ureteroscope is equivalent in function to our digital reusable scope and reduced the cost of flexible ureteroscopy.

Office Cystoscopy Urinary Tract Infection Rate and Cost before and after Implementing New Handling and Storage Practices	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						cystoscopy; antibiotic prophylaxis; disinfection	ANTIBIOTIC-PROPHYLAXIS; STATEMENT	Introduction: Based on 2010 American Urological Association recommendations our practice transitioned from sterile to high level disinfection flexible cystoscope reprocessing and from sterile to clean handling practices. We examined symptomatic urinary tract infection rate and cost before and after policy implementation. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 30-day outcomes following 1,888 simple cystoscopy encounters that occurred from 2007 to 2010 (sterile, 905) and 2012 to 2015 (high level disinfection, 983) at the Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center. We excluded veterans who had recent instrumentation, active or recent urinary tract infection, performed intermittent catheterization, or had complicated cystoscopy (dilation, biopsy etc). Patient/procedural factors and cost were collected and compared between groups. Results: Both cohorts had similar age (mean 68 years), race (Caucasian, 82%), comorbidities (cancer history, 62%; diabetes mellitus, 36%; tobacco use, 24.5%), and cystoscopy procedural indications (cancer surveillance, 50%; hematuria, 34%). Urological complication rate was low between groups (1.43%) with no significant difference in symptomatic urinary tract infection events (0.99% sterile vs 0.51% high level disinfection, p=0.29) or unplanned clinic/emergency department visits (0.66% sterile vs 0.71% high level disinfection, p=0.91). Roughly 95% of the cohorts were given prophylactic antibiotics, most commonly fluoroquinolones (91%). High level disinfection was $82 cheaper per procedure than sterile with most cost disparity stemming from reprocessing. Total savings for our facility by switching to high level disinfection was more than $100,000 annually. Conclusions: In an older, morbid veteran population receiving centralized care and prophylactic antibiotics we found no difference in symptomatic urinary tract infection or unplanned visits between sterile or high level disinfection techniques. However, high level disinfection was associated with a sizable cost savings, improved clinic workflow, and reduced use of personal protective equipment.

Given the burden of these procedures, there is growing interest in determining how the utilization, complications and morbidities associated with treatment contribute to the burden of care for upper tract urothelial cancer. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review to understand the economic burden of treating low grade upper tract urothelial cancer. Methods: The systematic literature review captured publications from January 1, 2009 to March 11, 2019 in MEDLINE (R), Embase (R), Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, PsycINFO and EconLit. Conference proceedings from 7 different conferences were also searched. Results: We identified 15 studies that reported on the economic burden associated with treatment interventions in upper tract urothelial cancer. Treatment costs associated with radical nephroureterectomy were the greatest cost component contributing to expenditures including initial procedural costs (ranging from $11,793 to $23,235 per patient), readmission/retreatment costs ($31,697 per patient) and long-terms costs up to 5 years associated with end stage renal disease and chronic kidney disease ($41,474 to $385,464 per patient). Kidney-sparing management was identified as a cost saving alternative to radical nephroureterectomy, with $252,272 per patient saved through 5 years. Conclusions: The economic burden of low grade upper tract urothelial cancer is high due to costs incurred by patient comorbidities, multiple episodes of care and complications associated with radical nephroureterectomy. Therefore, there is a need for a paradigm shift towards cost-effective, minimally invasive, kidney-sparing treatments.

Methods: We performed a scoping review using the search terms ("ureteral stents" "ureteral catheters" "nephroureteral stents" "nephroureteral catheters" or "double J stents") and ("tracking" or "lost stents" or "forgotten stents"). Two of the authors individually selected relevant articles based on title and abstract and performed full review of manuscripts and references. Results: Nine different studies focusing on forgotten ureteral stents were identified. Tracking mechanisms included electronic medical records algorithms, cellphone, chat or computer-based applications. Rates of lost or delayed removal of stents in hospitals prior to using a tracking system were 0%-13%. With a tracking mechanism, the rate of lost or delayed removal was reduced to 1% or less in the studies we identified. Conclusions: Stent tracking systems successfully reduced delayed removal of ureteral stents and reduced the rates of retained stents; however, these systems are institution specific, and no universal solution is readily available. Such a solution would be beneficial for the urological community to investigate further and for industry partners to invest in.

Commercial Prices for Prostatectomy and Treatment among Younger, Privately Insured Men with Prostate Cancer	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						health care economics and organizations; prostatic neoplasms; prostatectomy	FINANCIAL INCENTIVES; SERVICES	Introduction: Consensus is lacking about whether or how to treat men with prostate cancer, making it susceptible to nonclinical factors. The extent to which financial incentives afforded through differences in commercial prices for prostatectomy are associated with use of treatment, and prostatectomy in particular, is unknown. Methods: MarketScan (R) data were used to identify 38,863 privately insured men aged 64 years or younger diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2010 and 2016. Commercial prices for prostatectomy, defined by professional payments to urologists, were aggregated to the market level. Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure the association of commercial prices for prostatectomy and the use of treatment. Results: The adjusted use of treatment decreased from 87.1% for men diagnosed in 2010 to 71.1% for those diagnosed in 2016 (p <0.01 for trend). Among the treated, prostatectomy was the most common modality every year (eg 71.1% for those diagnosed in 2016). For every $1,000 increase in commercial prices, the adjusted odds of undergoing treatment decreased by 7% (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97, p <0.01). Among the treated, commercial prices were not significantly associated with use of prostatectomy (OR 0.99 for every $1,000 increase, 95% CI 0.89-1.10, p=0.85). Conclusions: Higher commercial prices for prostatectomy were associated with decreased use of treatment. The use of prostatectomy was not associated with its commercial prices.

Brantley			The American Board of Urology: In Pursuit of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						cultural diversity; specialty boards; urology	APPOINTMENT; DIRECTORS	Introduction: The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the methods we employ to build a foundation of diversity, quality and inclusion within the American Board of Urology and its certifying processes. Methods: The American Board of Urology consists of 3 major committees: the Trustees of the Board and the Written and Oral Exam Committees. Yearly, before selecting new members to these committees, a Gap analysis is performed to evaluate discrepancies between the committee structure and the constituents we serve. The selection of new committee members is based on both the individual's merit and an attempt to match or supersede the diversity ratios described within the most current national census conducted by the American Urological Association. Results: This year's evaluation revealed our committee structure consisting of 85% (98/115) male and 15% (17/115) women: National Census 90% and 10% respectively. Regarding race and ethnicity, White nonHispanic: 74% (85/115) compared to 81% (National Census); Hispanic: 1% (1/115) compared to 4%; Asian: 22% (25/115) compared to 12%; Black/African American 3% (4/115) compared to 2%. Conclusions: The American Board of Urology recognizes that the evaluation of ratios is an excellent initial step to establish diversity; however, ratios alone may not change behavior or attitudes. To reach our eventual goal, we must include educational efforts that inform our diplomates and committee members regarding the benefits of diversity. We also acknowledge that establishing and maintaining diversity within any governing board is an imperative that requires continuous and structural processes to be sustained.

The Rising Incidence of Penile Prosthesis Surgery as the First Line Surgical Treatment for Peyronie's Disease	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						penile prosthesis; penis; reconstructive surgical procedures	TUNICA ALBUGINEA PLICATION; ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION	Introduction: Peyronie's disease is a potentially debilitating connective tissue disorder of the penis that at times requires surgical intervention. There is a dearth of multi-center or community-level data regarding management trends. The aim of this study was to perform the first population-based assessment of surgical practice patterns in the treatment of Peyronie's disease among New York State urologists. Methods: We used the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) database to identify all patients who underwent surgical treatment for Peyronie's disease between 2003 and 2016. We used descriptive statistics and multinomial regression modeling to assess predictors of treatment choice. Results: Among 1,733 patients who underwent surgical treatment for Peyronie's disease, 30% underwent insertion of a penile prosthesis alone and 40% underwent insertion of a penile prosthesis with concurrent auxiliary procedures. Penile prosthesis (alone or in combination) was the first line surgical treatment in 21% of patients without documented erectile dysfunction. Relative rates of performing tunical plication and penile grafting decreased over time (both p <0.05), while insertion of a penile prosthesis/insertion of penile prosthesis with concurrent auxiliary procedures rates correspondingly increased (p=0.012). Conclusions: Insertion of penile prosthesis is by far the most commonly performed primary procedure for Peyronie's disease in New York State, with 1 in 5 patients without erectile dysfunction receiving an implant. While this trend cannot be explained by an administrative data set alone, it does warrant further exploration, as the declining utilization of alternate surgical treatments could compromise surgeon comfort in performing penile grafting and/or tunical plication in the future and may exacerbate disparities in treatment over time.

Our purpose was to determine associated factors and postoperative morbidity rates of early (<= 1 day) vs late (>1 day) hospital discharge after outpatient colporrhaphy. Methods: From the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (R) database, 11,652 female patients who received colporrhaphy between 2005 and 2016 were identified; 3,728 were stratified into the early discharge group and 7,924 into the late discharge group. Patient characteristics, surgical data and 30-day postoperative complications were recorded, and variables were compared between groups. Results: In comparison to the late discharge group, the early discharge group had a shorter mean operating time (p <0.001) and overall was less likely to suffer from 30-day morbidity (OR 0.67 [95% CI 0.55-0.82]), reoperation (OR 0.59 [95% CI 0.39-0.90]) or readmission (OR 0.40 [95% CI 0.26-0.90]). Factors independently associated with a lower likelihood of early discharge included age >= 55 years, higher body mass index, White race, current smoker, American Society of Anesthesiologists (R) classification IV/V and longer operating time. Increased likelihood of early discharge was associated with receiving colporrhaphy after 2012 and posterior colporrhaphy. Conclusions: Patients discharged from the hospital early had lower rates of postoperative morbidity than those discharged later. Early discharge was associated with procedures performed after 2012 and with isolated posterior colporrhaphy. Longer hospital stays were associated with longer operating times and older age, White race, obesity, comorbidities and history of smoking.	[Norton, J.

Resident Duty Hour Compliance and Sleep after Transitioning to a Night Float System: A Prospective Observational Study in an Academic Urology Program	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						education; medical; internship and residency; sleep; graduate medical education; actigraphy	CARE; DURATION; QUALITY; ERRORS; RISK	Introduction: Our urology residency program transitioned to a night float system, where dedicated residents cover nights and are off duty during the day. Junior residents previously covered 5 hospitals every 5 to 7 nights and worked the following day (home call). This prospective observational study compared the 2 systems before and after the transition. Methods: A validated survey was administered to residents and faculty to evaluate patient care, communication, quality of life, resident education, and duty hour violations. A separate survey was administered to nurses evaluating the on-call resident. Sleep was measured using actigraphy. Results: Survey response rates were 80% to 100%. Junior residents rated night float as equivalent to home call for surgical case volume and superior in all other respects (p <0.05). Senior residents rated night float as superior for continuity of care, compassion, safety, efficiency for the day team, communication with nurses, quality of life, and time for reading and research (p <0.05). Faculty rated night float as superior for efficiency for the day team, handoffs, quality of life, and time for research (p <0.05). Nurses rated night float higher for availability, knowledge of plan for patient, respectfulness, communication, and ability to identify the resident on call (p <0.05). Mean duration of sleep was 2.5 and 7.1 hours for home call and night float, respectively (p <0.001). Junior residents reported fewer violations of the 80-hour and 8-hour-off rules with night float (p <0.001). Conclusions: Physicians and nurses perceived night float to improve multiple domains. Residents slept more and had fewer duty hour violations on night float.

We sought to examine the correlation between educational debt and anticipated practice choices and career expectations to better understand the impact of debt on urology trainees to inform urology workforce policy. Methods: Data were collected from urology trainees who completed the AUA Annual Census between 2016 and 2018. We examined level of debt among urology trainees against their anticipated practice choices compensation expectation and various debt relief variables. Results: Among 705 U.S. urology trainees who completed the survey, 22% had no debt, 23% had <$150,000 debt, 27% had $150,000 to $250,000 of debt, and the remaining 27% had >$250,000. Debt level did not appear to significantly affect anticipated future practice setting or the decision to pursue fellowship. Concerning how loan forgiveness influenced practice opportunity, 31% of trainees reported no effect, 42% some effect and 27% great effect. Those trainees with higher level of debt appeared to be more likely to accept a practice opportunity if loan forgiveness was offered (p <= 0.001). Those trainees with higher level of debt were more likely to anticipate higher annual compensation as compared to those with less debt (p=0.001). Conclusions: Nearly 70% of those trainees with debt had $150,000 of debt or higher. Our study showed carrying educational debt is statistically associated with trainees' choice of anticipated practice for better compensation and tuition forgiveness. Workforce policy should consider addressing the financial burden of urology trainees.

Due to the complexity of care, families likely benefit from multidisciplinary care allowing for coordination of psychosocial and health services. Unfortunately, there are few data on the experiences of families of patients with differences of sex development in a multidisciplinary setting, such as their satisfaction with health care or their level of shared decision making. Methods: Patients and guardians seen in a multidisciplinary, differences in sex development clinic were asked to participate in an anonymous online survey of their satisfaction with health care delivery (Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form) and involvement in shared decision making (Shared Decision Making Questionnaire) Welch's t-test was used to compare mean survey scores to historical and contemporary control populations. Results: In all, 22 guardians and 1 young adult patient completed surveys. Median patient age was 36 months. Patient diagnoses were diverse, with the most common diagnosis beings 46, XY DSD (34.8%). At the time of their clinic visit, 7 patients had undergone surgery. Mean satisfaction scores were higher than a primary care population and comparable to patients and patients' caregivers with chronic medical conditions. The mean shared decision making score was well above adult populations and similar to caregiver reports in pediatric outpatient clinics. Conclusions: Despite the complex treatment associated with differences of sex development, families are very satisfied with the quality of care they receive in a multidisciplinary setting and appear to feel personally invested in the decision making process.

However, little is known about the educational debt metrics in the urology workforce. Therefore, we set out to characterize educational debt among practicing urologists. Methods: The American Urological Association (AUA) Workforce Workgroup examined the 2019 AUA Census data. Domains pertaining to demographics and educational debt were examined. Results: Of respondents 31.6% never had educational debt, 47.6% have paid off all their debt, 9.9% had <=$150,000 debt, and 11% had >$150,000. Of the respondents practicing urology for 11-15 years since completing residency 20.2% had <=$150,000 debt and 6.5% reported >$150,000 compared to 29% and 17.4%, respectively, for those practicing urology 6-10 years since completing residency. Of female urologists 18.6% had <=$150,000 and 18.4% carried over >$150,000 compared to 9.0% and 10.1%, respectively, among male urologists (p <0.001). Concerning race, 21% of Black respondents carried <=$150,000 and 30.4% carried >$150,000 compared to 9.4% and 10.9% in whites and 12.5% and 4.2% in Asian respondents. Furthermore, those in academic settings were more likely to have educational debt compared to those in private groups, 13.5% vs 10.7% vs 10.1% <=$150,000 and 12.5% vs 10.9% vs 10.3% >$150,000, respectively (p=0.01); 23.6% felt their educational debt contributed to burnout Conclusions: A large percentage of practicing urologists carry educational debt for several years after residency. A higher percentage of respondents with Black race and female gender have debt compared to white and Asian race, and male gender. A substantial proportion of those with debt feel the debt contributes to burnout.

A method to specifically evaluate dissection performance does not yet exist. This project aimed to design a tool to assess surgical dissection quality. Methods: Delphi method was used to validate structure and content of the dissection evaluation. A multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary panel of 14 expert surgeons systematically evaluated each element of the dissection tool. Ten blinded reviewers evaluated 46 de-identified videos of pelvic lymph node and seminal vesicle dissections during the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Inter-rater variability was calculated using prevalence-adjusted and bias-adjusted kappa. The area under the curve from receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess discrimination power for overall Dissection Assessment for Robotic Technique (DART) scores as well as domains in discriminating trainees (<= 100 robotic cases) from experts (>100). Results: Four rounds of Delphi method achieved language and content validity in 27/28 elements. Use of 3 or 5-point scale remained contested; thus, both scales were evaluated during validation. The 3-point scale showed improved kappa for each domain. Experts demonstrated significantly greater total scores on both scales (3-point, p <0.001; 5-point, p <0.001). The ability to distinguish experience was equivalent for total score on both scales (3-point AUC=0.92, CI 0.82-1.00; 5-point AUC=0.92, CI 0.83-1.00). Conclusions: We present the development and validation of DART, an objective and reproducible 3-point surgical assessment to evaluate tissue dissection. DART can effectively differentiate levels of surgeon experience and can be used in multiple surgical steps.

Delayed Urological Cancer Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Urologists' Experience	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						COVID-19; urologic neoplasms; time-to-treatment; physician distress; emotional distress		Introduction: The arrival of coronavirus disrupted health care systems and forced delays in cancer treatment. We explored the experience of urologists who had to delay their patients' cancer care. Methods: Urologists who treat prostate, bladder, and renal cancers, selected through purposive sampling, responded to a survey about cancer treatment delay. They were asked about their practice setting, decision making and interactions with patients, and they were asked to reflect on their personal experience. A 0 to 10 point scale, modeled on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network' Distress Thermometer (NCCN-DT), validated for cancer patients with cancer, was used to estimate physician distress. We used descriptive statistics to analyze survey results. Results: Of the 64 participating urologists, 98% delayed surgical treatment; fewer delayed cases of advanced cancers (42% for >= T3/T4 or Gleason >= 8 prostate cancers, 58% for muscle invasive bladder cancer, 61% for >= T2 renal cancers). They reported feeling anxious (44%) and helpless (29%), and their median distress score was 5 (range 0-10). They relied on their own risk assessments (67%) and consulted colleagues ( 56%) and national guidelines (53%) when making treatment deferral decisions. They identified a number of concerns as they resumed surgeries. Conclusions: Based on a comparison to the NCCN-DT clinical cutoff distress level of 4, urologists experienced moderately high levels of distress as they delayed cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic and expressed concerns going forward. While the focus on patient care is paramount in a pandemic, it is important to recognize physician distress and develop practical and psychological strategies for distress mitigation.

Patient Satisfaction in a Safety Net Urology Clinic	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						patient satisfaction; urology; ambulatory care	AFFORDABLE CARE ACT; VULNERABLE PATIENTS; MEDICAL MISTRUST; PERCEPTIONS; TIME	Introduction: Patient satisfaction has become an important metric in medicine. In this study, we aim to identify modifiable factors contributing toward poor satisfaction amongst patients in a safety net urology clinic. We hypothesize that wait times and long distances traveled to clinic will have the largest contribution toward negative patient experiences. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult patients presenting to the urology clinic at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. Participants completed a survey using the RAND Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-18 after their clinic visit. Associations among demographic factors, wait times, use of a translator and satisfaction were examined. Results: Two hundred patients, 19 to 90 years old (median age 62), were enrolled. Overall, 65% of patients were satisfied with their experience in our clinic. Our results demonstrated a significant association among race, language and overall satisfaction scores (p=0.009 and p=0.003, respectively). Multivariable analysis showed that those who waited more than an hour to see a physician were less satisfied compared with those who waited less than 15 minutes (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.74). Similarly, those who used a translator were less satisfied than those who did not use a translator (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08-1.01). Conclusions: In a safety net urology clinic, language differences and wait times may contribute to poor patient satisfaction. Future efforts toward improving language interpreter functionality and decreasing patient wait times will likely improve patient satisfaction.

UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						mitomycin; urinary bladder neoplasms; administration; intravesical; guideline adherence	IMMEDIATE POSTOPERATIVE INSTILLATION; TRANSURETHRAL RESECTION; MITOMYCIN-C; RECURRENCE; METAANALYSIS; RISK	Introduction: The intravesical instillation of mitomycin C immediately following surgery for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer has been shown to be efficacious in reducing cancer recurrence. As a result, the American Urological Association adopted guidelines for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer care to support its use in low to intermediate risk patients. Despite this, the use of this drug by urologists following transurethral resection of bladder tumor has been reported to be 5% or less. Our study objective was to better understand the barriers urologists experience in using mitomycin C. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 13 practicing urologists at 4 geographically distinct practice locations throughout Indiana between 2017 and 2018. Cognitive task analysis was used to explore factors that influenced their clinician decision making about mitomycin C use following transurethral resection of bladder tumor in specific patient cases. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed using immersion/crystallization to identify emergent themes. Results: The median age of the urologists interviewed was 44 years (IQR 40-48). Of the interviewees 85% were male. Approximately 30% had completed urological fellowship training; 62% were in private practice. Three major themes related to the use of mitomycin C emerged, ie cumbersome workflow processes, urologists' fear of side effects and issues of identifying patients most likely to benefit. Conclusions: Workflow, fear and value are key factors, and also represent complexities of translating efficacy into effectiveness for a drug with known benefits to patients. Areas of potential intervention development to improve the use of mitomycin C to reduce recurrence of bladder cancer are suggested.

Population Management Approach to Kidney Stone Care Improves Patient Compliance to Preventive Measures and Reduces Resource Utilization in Patients at High Risk for Stone Recurrence	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						preventive medicine; kidney calculi; emergency treatment; urinalysis; population health management	MEDICAL-MANAGEMENT; NEPHROLITHIASIS; UROLITHIASIS; PREVALENCE; DISEASES	Introduction: Nephrolithiasis is a chronic condition with 5 to 10-year recurrence rates as high as 50%. Stone recurrence can be reduced by implementing American Urological Association kidney stone medical management guidelines, which recommend additional metabolic testing for high risk, recurrent and interested first-time stone formers. However, clinician adherence to guidelines is variable, and patient compliance with preventive evaluations is low. We evaluated our kidney stone population management program's role in patient compliance with completing American Urological Association metabolic studies. We assessed the program's impact on office encounters, operating room procedures and emergency department visits for known high risk kidney stone patients. Methods: A retrospective review of electronic medical records between 2009 and 2017 identified 4,029 kidney stone patients. A total of 873 patients were at high risk for kidney stone recurrence. In 2013, we established a population management program in which high risk patients were referred and followed by a nurse case manager. Patients were contacted by email or telephone if metabolic serum and urine collections were incomplete. Office, operating room and emergency department visits were compared before and after the program's implementation. Results: Metabolic evaluation orders increased from 17% to 35% in our institution's urology department. Patient compliance with recommended studies improved from <10% to 82%, and reductions in office visits by 48%, surgical procedures by 38% and emergency department encounters by 40% were observed. Conclusions: Our program improved patient compliance with American Urological Association recommended studies for high risk kidney stone patients. Reductions in stone events may have been due to our program but require further study in the future.

Initial Presentation and Outcomes of Testicular Cancer among Different Racial and Ethnic Groups at a Tertiary Care Facility in New Mexico	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						testicular neoplasms; healthcare disparities; treatment outcome; ethnic groups	GERM-CELL TUMORS; DISPARITIES; SURVIVAL; TRENDS; IMPACT; RACE; MEN	Introduction: This study explored differences in testicular cancer presentation, treatment, compliance and outcomes among ethnicities in New Mexico. Methods: A retrospective review of patients with testicular cancer treated between 2002 and 2015 was performed. Data included demographics, stage, delays in care, treatments, insurance status and nonadherence rates. Results: Of 186 patients Hispanics and Native Americans presented at higher stage (p <0.01) and delayed treatment (p=0.02). Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for stage I disease was 28% while stage II was 30%, compared to 18% and 58% nationally, respectively. Of stage II in Hispanic patients 24.5% received retroperitoneal lymph node dissection compared to 41.3% of Caucasians (p <0.05). Regarding chemotherapy Caucasian patients at stage I were more likely than Hispanics to receive chemotherapy (p <0.05). Hispanics had higher rates of nonadherence (p <0.01). Insurance rates did not differ among groups. However, insurance increased the likelihood for receiving chemotherapy/retroperitoneal lymph node dissection only for Caucasians. Lack of insurance increased active surveillance rates for stage I in Hispanics. The incidence of testicular cancer in Hispanics rose by 58% after 2009 (p <0.05). Conclusions: Minority groups presented at higher stages and delayed treatment. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection rates differed nationally compared to this cohort with Hispanic patients at higher stage being less likely to receive retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Meanwhile, Hispanics with stage I are less likely to obtain chemotherapy. Insurance rates did not differ among ethnicities but having insurance did not increase rates of chemotherapy/retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for Hispanics unlike for Caucasians. Meanwhile, lack of insurance increased stage I rates of active surveillance suggesting cultural/financial factors contribute to treatment decisions. Increased health literacy, outreach and access may aid in alleviating these disparities.

We compared prostate cancer care before and during the pandemic in a multi-institutional cohort. Methods: A prospective regional collaborative was queried to assess practice pattern variations relative to the initial COVID-19 lockdown (March 16 to May 15, 2020). The preceding 10 months were selected for comparison. The impact of the lockdown was evaluated on the basis of 1) weekly trends in biopsy and radical prostatectomy volumes, 2) comparisons between those undergoing prostate biopsy, and 3) clinicopathological characteristics within radical prostatectomy patients. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact and Pearson's chi-square tests, and Wilcoxon rank sum test to evaluate continuous covariates. Results: Overall, there was a 55% and 39% decline in biopsy and prostatectomy volumes, respectively. During the pandemic, biopsy patients were younger with fewer COVID-19 severity risk factors (17.0% vs 9.7% no risk factors, p=0.023) and prostatectomy patients had higher grade group (GG; 45.6% >GG 4 vs 28%, p=0.01). Large variation in the change in procedural volume was noted across practice sites. Conclusion: In a multi-institutional assessment of surgical and diagnostic delay for prostate cancer, we found a non-uniform decline in procedural volume across sites. Future analyses within this cohort are needed to further discern the effects of care delays related to COVID-19.

Methods: The 2004-2014 National Cancer Database was queried for adult patients with histopathologically diagnosed American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I RCC <= 5 cm undergoing RMB and thermal ablation. RMB sequencing was stratified into "staged RMB" (separate sessions for RMB/ablation) or "concomitant RMB" (same date RMB/ablation). Demographics, cancer variables and time trends were compared. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of concomitant RMB, and evaluated their impact on inpatient hospital stay and 30-day unplanned readmissions. Results: A total of 6,323 patients were included, of whom 2,913 (46.1%) underwent staged RMB and 3,410 (53.9%) underwent concomitant RMB. Concomitant RMB was more frequently performed until 2012, and staged RMB thereafter (trend p <0.001). In multivariable logistic regression models, private insurance, clear cell RCC, right-sided disease and smaller tumor diameter demonstrated higher probability of concomitant RMB. Furthermore, geographical differences across the United States were evident (concomitant RMB West/South Central region 64.6% versus New England 29.3%, multivariable p <0.05). Concomitant RMB was associated with greater odds of inpatient hospital stay (multivariable OR=1.42, 95% CI=1. 27-1. 60; p <0.001) and 30-day unplanned hospital readmissions (OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.07-2.27; p=0.022). Conclusions: Staged RMB is more frequently performed in more recent years and is associated with lower odds of inpatient hospital stay and unplanned readmissions within 30 days. These potential benefits, combined with the potential to limit ablation of benign tumors, need to be weighed against additional health care costs and inconvenience associated with 2 interventions.

Are Postoperative Laboratory Studies Following Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Necessary?	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						robotics; prostatectomy		Introduction: We evaluated the necessity of obtaining routine postoperative laboratory studies, such as complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, after robotic assisted radical prostatectomy. Methods: This study is a retrospective review of 200 robotic assisted radical prostatectomy cases performed over a year and a half at our institution. The incidences of laboratory abnormalities were examined along with any clinical intervention. Patient demographics, tumor stage, Gleason score, operative time, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, presence of comorbidities and postoperative laboratory studies were extracted from the electronic medical record. The costs of laboratory studies were tabulated to further analyze potential savings to patients. Results: Only 15 (7.5%) patients demonstrated laboratory abnormalities that required medical intervention. Of these 15 patients, all demonstrated hypokalemia that was treated with potassium supplementation. Patients with longer lengths of stay demonstrated higher percentages of medical intervention. The costs of these laboratory studies were calculated at $8,840. Conclusions: Lower blood loss and transfusion rates with the advent of robotic assisted radical prostatectomy along with the results described in this study provide greater evidence that postoperative laboratory studies may be futile. By eliminating these laboratory studies, substantial cost savings are realized if extrapolated across the United States. This study is limited in its evaluation of complications from different types of medical centers, higher risk patients, postoperative laboratory studies impact on symptomatic patients, and absence of emergency room visits or hospital readmissions.

Innovative Approaches to Battling Resident Burnout in a Urology Residency Program	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article							INTERNAL-MEDICINE RESIDENTS; WORK-LIFE BALANCE; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PATIENT-CARE; JOB BURNOUT; PHYSICIANS; IMPACT; SATISFACTION; STRATEGIES; EDUCATION	Introduction: Data suggest many U.S. physicians experience burnout, affecting up to 65% of U.S. urology resident physicians. We implemented a multifaceted Urology Resident Wellness Curriculum and measured its effect on burnout reported among our trainees. Methods: We created a 5-pronged Resident Wellness Curriculum: 1) faculty-sponsored Resident Wellness Fund, 2) social groups between 1 faculty and 2-3 trainees, 3) one-on-one structured mentorship, 4) resident-organized social outings using the Resident Wellness Fund, and 5) wellness education. We administered 2 validated burnout questionnaires, the Maslach Burnout Index-Human Services Survey and the Expanded Mayo Physician Well Being Index, to our resident physicians at 4 time points, immediately before and following curriculum implementation. At study conclusion, resident physicians were asked to rank the most meaningful interventions. Results: At 4 timepoints over 3 academic years, 54 completed instruments were collected from 32 unique resident physicians. Initial Maslach Burnout Index survey data indicated high levels of Depersonalization and Emotional Exhaustion with moderate levels of Personal Accomplishment. Over the study period, there was improvement in Depersonalization from high to moderate (28% decrease, p=0.04), improvement in Emotional Exhaustion from high to moderate (20% decrease, p=0.15) and preserved moderate Personal Accomplishment. The average Physician Well Being Index score decreased by 52% (p=0.006), demonstrating decreased levels of distress. Resident-organized social outings were ranked as the most meaningful intervention, with 63% of participants ranking it first. Conclusions: Rates of urology resident physician burnout were observed to be high at baseline, but improved significantly after introduction of a purposeful Resident Wellness Curriculum.

Understanding the Barriers to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients with Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer: A Quality Improvement Initiative	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						neoadjuvant therapy; quality improvement; urinary bladder neoplasms	PERIOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY	Introduction: Utilization of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for the management of muscle invasive bladder cancer remains low. We sought to understand our practice of neoadjuvant chemotherapy use in order to design a quality improvement initiative geared toward optimizing medical oncology referral. Methods: We identified 339 patients with >= cT2 bladder cancer treated with radical cystectomy between 2012 and 2017 at our institution. We assessed the rate of referral to medical oncology, rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy administration and medical, patient and provider variables associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy use. Bayesian logistic regression modeling identified variables associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy use, and chart review provided granular patient-level data. Results: Of the patients 85% (289) were referred to medical oncology and 62.5% (12) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Renal insufficiency, hearing loss and treating urologist were conclusively associated with lower odds of neoadjuvant chemotherapy use. A total of 46 patients were not referred to medical oncology, and 50% of these patients had medical contraindications to cisplatin cited as the reason for no referral. A total of 38 patients met with medical oncology but did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 30 patients (79%) had comorbidities that impacted this decision, with 15 (39%) ineligible based on impaired renal function. Conclusions: Despite the relatively high rates of medical oncology referral and neoadjuvant chemotherapy use in this cohort, there are still opportunities to improve the efficiency of this practice. Quality improvement initiatives could optimize the referral of patients with >= T2 bladder cancer for consideration of cisplatin based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and establish an important quality metric in the management of these patients.

Methods: We analyzed information from successful urology match participants in the United States between 2015 and 2020. Data were collected from the Association of American Medical Colleges applications, UrologyMatch.com and SurveyMonkey (R). Information recorded included each candidate's name, hometown, undergraduate institution, graduate or research program (if applicable), medical school, location of visiting subinternships in urological surgery and urology residency training program. Results: Overall, 1,080 of 1,451 successful urology match candidates (74.4%) met 1 or more "familiarity" criteria. Specifically, 329 (22.7%) and 508 (35.0%) students successfully matched into their home and visiting urology training programs, respectively. Of the remaining applicants 153 (10.5%) and 90 (6.2%) matched into training programs <150 miles from their hometowns and within institutions of previous academic pursuits, respectively. South Central section programs were most likely to match students into their home programs (p=0.010). Visiting students were most and least likely to match at programs from Western (p=0.044) and Northeastern (p=0.001) sections, respectively. The New York section matched more candidates from hometowns within 150 miles compared to other sections of the American Urological Association (p=0.0003). Conclusions: Student and program "familiarity" may play a role in residency match success. Our study demonstrated nearly 75% of urology applicants matched into either their home institutions, visiting subinternship programs, sites of previous undergraduate/graduate studies or training programs <150 miles from their hometowns.

Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted on 149 patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin for intermediate and high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer between 2001 and 2018, and who were followed for cancer recurrence through March 2019. The primary outcomes were disease-free survival, low grade disease-free survival, high grade disease-free survival and progression-free survival at 5 years. Kaplan-Meier survival curves stratified by race (African American vs nonAfrican American) were analyzed for all the above outcomes and multivariate Cox regression analyses were also performed to compare recurrence differences by race after adjusting for age, sex, initial stage and grade. Results: Of the 149 patients 37.6% were Caucasian, 24.8% were African American, 26.8% were Hispanic and 10.7% were of other/unknown race. Disease stage at initial presentation was 65.1% Ta, 34.9% T1 and 18.1% carcinoma in situ, respectively. African American patients (37) did not have evidence for worse outcomes vs nonAfrican American patients when considering disease-free survival (54.1% vs 65.7%, p=0.202), high grade disease-free survival (58.8% vs 71.7%, p=0.158) and progression-free survival (83.8% vs 92.6%, p=0.117) at 5 years. Multivariate analysis did not reveal statistically significant racial differences in recurrence or progression. Conclusions: African Americans with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer did not have worse disease recurrence and progression after receiving intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin treatment. Although there did appear to be a trend towards worse oncologic outcomes in African Americans, larger studies are needed to validate this finding.

Effect of Diagnostic Biopsy Practice Location on Grade/Volume Reclassification in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: A Multicenter Analysis from the Canary PASS Cohort	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						prostatic neoplasms; biopsy; watchful waiting	RISK; MEN; INTEROBSERVER; CARCINOMA	Introduction: We analyzed the Canary Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance (PASS) cohort to determine if patients who had diagnostic biopsy at an off-site practice were at higher risk of reclassification than those having their diagnostic biopsy at a PASS site. Methods: Participants were prospectively enrolled at 10 academic institutions. We included patients with Gleason score 6 at diagnostic biopsy, <34% positive cores and a first surveillance biopsy in a PASS site <2 years after diagnosis. We dichotomized our population based on diagnostic biopsy location (on-PASS site vs off-PASS site) and used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate association with reclassification at first surveillance biopsy after controlling for possible confounders. We used Fisher's exact test to compare rates of definitive prostate cancer treatment by diagnostic biopsy location. Results: Out of 1,648 participants in PASS, 906 met the eligibility criteria and were analyzed. Of 519 men who had off-site diagnostic biopsy, 102 (20%) had grade/volume reclassification compared to 72 (19%) of 399 patients who had on-site diagnostic biopsy. After controlling for potential confounders, location of diagnostic biopsy was not significantly associated with grade/volume reclassification (OR 1.32, IQR 0.91-1.92; p=0.141). Participants with an off-site diagnostic biopsy were more likely to elect definitive treatment than participants with an on-site diagnostic biopsy (17%, IQR 14-20 vs 14%, IQR 10-17 within 1 year after first surveillance biopsy; p <0.01). Conclusions: In this evaluation of a large multicenter active surveillance cohort, diagnostic biopsy location was not associated with significant differences in grade/volume reclassification on confirmatory biopsy at academic institutions.

While eConsults have been successfully implemented in many medical specialties, their use in the practice of urology is relatively unknown. Methods: We included data from 4 academic institutions: the University of Michigan, University of California-San Francisco, University of Washington and the Montefiore Medical Center. We included every urological eConsult performed at each institution from the launch of their respective programs through August 2019. We considered an eConsult "converted" when the participating urologist recommended a full in-person evaluation. We report eConsult conversion rate, response time, completion time and diagnosis categories. Results: A total of 462 urological eConsults were requested. Of these, 36% were converted to a traditional in-person visit. Among 119 resolved eConsults with data on provider response time available 53.8% were addressed in less than 1 day, 28.6% in 1 day, 8.4% in 2 days, 3.4% in 3 days, 3.4% in 4 days, 1.7% in 5 days, and 0.8% in >= 6 days. Among 283 resolved eConsults with data on provider completion time available 50.2% were completed in 1-10 minutes, 46.7% in 11-20 minutes, 2.8% in 21-30 minutes, and less than 1% in >= 31 minutes. Conclusions: Our study suggests that eConsults are an effective avenue for urologists to provide recommendations for many common nonsurgical urological conditions and thus avoid a traditional in-person visit for low complexity situations. Further investigation into the impact of eConsults on health care costs and access to urological care is necessary.

Medical Malpractice and Nephrolithiasis: U.S. Appellate Cases from 2001 to 2018	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						malpractice; jurisprudence; kidney calculi; nephrolithiasis	MANAGEMENT; GUIDELINE; STONES; STATE	Introduction: Kidney stones are one of the most litigated diagnoses in urological practice. To better understand the cause for and outcomes of medical malpractice cases related to nephrolithiasis we analyzed United States medical malpractice appeals court cases from 2001 to 2018. Methods: We searched LexisNexis for "kidney stone/nephrolithiasis" and "malpractice" from 2001 to 2018. Individual case data were compiled and analyzed with descriptive statistics, including involved parties, outcome of the initial case/appeal, alleged physician negligence, monetary awards granted and size of awards. Results: Our search yielded 45 cases, of which 33 met criteria for analysis. The patient/spouse was the plaintiff in 23/33 (69%) cases, and the patient's estate was the plaintiff in 10/33 (30%) cases. A urologist was a defendant in 19/33 (57%) cases and nonurological providers were named in 10/33 (30%) cases. A hospital was named in 21/33 (64%) lawsuits. A total of 30/33 (91%) suits cited an error in treatment as the primary negligence. Of all cases, 10% were reversed on appeal and the majority of cases were found in favor of the defendant initially and on appeal. Overall, the defendant prevailed in 21/33 (63%) of cases. Four trials involved payment to a plaintiff and the average payout was $1,075,439 (range $193,000-$3,000,000). Conclusions: The majority of nephrolithiasis malpractice suits involve a verdict in favor of the urologist, physician or hospital, even after appeal. Errors in treatment are much more commonly litigated than errors in diagnosis. Although the prevalence of plaintiff payout was low, awards granted averaged over a million dollars per case.

Video visits in particular have shown high satisfaction and cost-saving for patients. However, there has been little investigation into how video visits compare to traditional clinic visits on measures of clinical efficiency and reimbursement. Methods: Our data set included 250 video visits of established patients at Michigan Medicine Department of Urology and 250 in-person clinic visits with the same providers completed between July 2016 and July 2017. Information on visit completion and cancellation rates, cycle time (time from check-in to check-out), reimbursement; and patient out-of-pocket expenses was collected using the electronic medical record and billing data. Results: Completion rates were similar between video and clinic visits (58% vs 61%, respectively, p=0.24). Average cycle time for video visits was significantly shorter compared to clinic visits (24 minutes vs 80 minutes, respectively, p <0.01). Neither average commercial payer reimbursement (p=0.21) nor average out-of-pocket expense (p=0.22) was statistically different between video and traditional visits. More video visits than clinic visits were billed as level 3 encounters (85% and 63%, respectively, p=0.002). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that video visits have the potential to reduce the time patients spend on followup care without negatively impacting reimbursement rates. However, these visits could reduce average billing levels. These findings suggest that the incorporation of video visits into practice may be more efficient for patients but may also reduce billing levels.

Association of 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitor Use with Prostate Specific Antigen Level at the Time of Urology Referral in a Retrospective Cohort at a Large, Integrated Health Care System	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						prostatic neoplasms; 5-alpha reductase inhibitors; health services research; prostate-specific antigen	CANCER RISK; CALCULATORS; FINASTERIDE; MEN	Introduction: 5-Alpha reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) use leads to a 50% decline in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) without a concomitant decrease in prostate cancer (PCa) risk. We hypothesize that failure to account for the effect of 5-ARI use on serum PSA leads to increased PCa risk at urology referral among 5-ARI users. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study for the years 2018-2019. Atrium Health is a large, vertically integrated health system with over 900 care locations in North Carolina and South Carolina. Men >= 40 years old during 2018-2019 who had a PSA test performed were included. We determined differences in corrected serum PSA level at the time of referral to urology. 5-ARI users and nonusers were compared using the chi-square test, Student's t-test and gamma regression. Results: From 2018-2019, there were 91,368 men who underwent PSA testing, including 2,939 5-ARI users. At referral, 5-ARI users had similar uncorrected median PSA (5.8 vs 5.6 ng/ml, p=0.05). After correcting for the effect of 5-ARIs on PSA, 5-ARI users had a median PSA of 11.6 ng/ml at urology referral, compared to 5.6 ng/ml in nonusers. Conclusions: Men taking 5-ARIs have higher corrected serum PSA at time of referral to urology. As the unadjusted PSA at referral to urology for PCa risk was similar between 5-ARI users and nonusers, this indicates that the effect of 5-ARI use on serum PSA levels is not routinely accounted for when assessing PCa risk.

A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Factors Associated with Appointment Completion and Visit Modality during Virtual Urology Visits	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						telemedicine; human characteristics; healthcare disparities; health care delivery	TELEHEALTH; BARRIERS	Introduction: The necessary transition to telehealth during COVID-19 generated new challenges for providers and patients, with the opportunity to exacerbate or mitigate standing care inequities. To better understand virtual medicine care delivery in urology, we sought to identify factors associated with appointment completion and use of telephone or video visits. Methods: We performed a retrospective, single-institutional cross-sectional analysis of all remote patient appointments from March 17, 2020-August 31, 2020. The primary outcome was appointment completion rate. Patients were determined to have not completed an appointment if they canceled, left before being seen or were a "no show." Secondary analysis evaluated factors associated with scheduling video vs telephone appointment. Various patient and appointment-specific factors were analyzed. Chi-squared tests and univariate logistic regression were used for analysis accordingly. Results: Of 3,769 appointments, 2,996 (79.5%) were completed while 773 (20.5%) were not, with 1,544 (41.0%) completed over telephone while 2,225 (59.0%) used video. Race, age, income, insurance, location, division and appointment length showed statistical significance (p <0.05) for appointment completion and visit modality. Females were more likely to use video (62.7% vs 58.0%, p=0.01). Patients were more likely to complete afternoon visits (81.1% vs 78.3%, p=0.04), visits with physicians (81.2% vs 75.4%, p <0.01) and phone calls (83.3% vs 76.9%, p <0.01). Conclusions: Multiple factors were associated with both appointment completion rate and use of telephone or video. These factors may reflect disparities in social determinants of health and select patients may benefit from additional coordination of care to prevent missed appointments and deconstruct inequities.

Axial Diameter is Superior to Volumetric Measurement in Predicting Ureteral Stone Passage	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						nephrolithiasis; renal colic; ureteral calculi	RENAL-CALCULI; MANAGEMENT; SIZE; TOMOGRAPHY; GUIDELINE; CT	Introduction: We sought to investigate the clinical utility of volumetric measurements in predicting passage of symptomatic ureteral calculi. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients seen in the emergency department for computerized tomography-confirmed symptomatic ureteral calculi with a subsequent discharge for trial of passage. Patient demographics and results of the passage trial were recorded. Stone parameters including location, 2-dimensional linear measurements and 3-dimensional volume measurements were calculated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the association between the aforementioned stone parameters and stone passage. Results: A total of 70 patients were analyzed, of whom 37 (53%) passed their stones. On univariate analysis, patients who passed their stones had shorter axial diameters (mean +/- SD 3.3 +/- 1.3 mm vs 5.1 +/- 1.7 mm, p <0.01) and smaller volumes (0.03 +/- 0.02 cm(3) vs 0.10 +/- 0.08 cm(3), p <0.01). Stones that passed had traversed 79% of the ureter on presentation, compared to 41% for the stones that did not pass (p <0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that shorter axial diameter was independently associated with stone passage (OR 0.46 [CI 0.29-0.71], p <0.01). Inclusion of stone volume measurements into the logistic regression model, however, provided no additional benefit for predicting stone passage rates (p=0.28). Conclusions: Although a stone's volume is expectedly correlated with passage, it does not seem to provide additional benefit when the stone's axial diameter and location within the ureter are known. Based on our findings, additional investment of time and resources into 3-dimensional modalities may not be warranted in this setting.

UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						urinary bladder neoplasms; education; tobacco; tobacco use cessation	SMOKING-CESSATION; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; PRO-TOBACCO; AWARENESS; EXPOSURE; RISK	Introduction: In order to assess whether bladder cancer is appropriately referenced in online anti-tobacco advertisements, we evaluated 200 videos and assessed diseases mentioned in these videos. This was then compared to relative incidence of tobacco-associated malignancy. Methods: Smoking cessation campaign videos were identified using the Google Video search page. The first 50 video results of 4 colloquial search terms were assessed for diseases mentioned. Videos were categorized as malignancy-related anti-tobacco advertisement or all anti-tobacco advertisement. Relative weight for each tobacco-associated malignancy was defined as the rate of reference within malignancy-related anti-tobacco advertisements divided by the incidence of that cancer among all smoking-related malignancies. Results: In all, 200 total videos were reviewed. The most common conditions highlighted were addiction (56, 27.0%) and death (26, 13.0%). The most common malignancies addressed were lung cancer (22, 11.0%), throat cancer (20, 10.0%) and oral cancer (9, 4.5%). Only 1 (0.5%) video mentioned bladder cancer. The relative weights of each malignancy were: lung cancer 1.09, oral cancer 18.26, throat cancer 1.94, bladder cancer 0.14. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the significant opportunity that exists for public education regarding the relationship between tobacco use and bladder cancer. Despite a relatively high incidence amongst tobacco-associated malignancies, bladder cancer is very poorly represented in anti-tobacco advertising with a relative weight of 0.14. It is possible that a more representative presentation of the adverse effects of tobacco use would be more efficacious in promoting tobacco cessation.

Catching a Big Fish with a Small Net: Factors Associated with First-Choice Match from Urology Residency Applicants' Self-Reported Data	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						residency; medical student; self report; education; medical; graduate	PREDICTORS	Introduction: We sought to determine the accuracy of self-reported urology applicant match data and determine which factors were most influential on successful application outcomes. Methods: A publicly accessible Google spreadsheet entitled "Urology Residency Applicant Spreadsheet" containing self-reported urology residency applicant characteristics and match outcomes was analyzed for differences across the years 2017+2018 (pre-aggregated) -2020. These data were compared to published data from the American Urological Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges. Statistical modeling of the self-reported data was performed to determine which applicant characteristics were predictive of match outcomes. Results: Averages of self-reported data were similar to published match data with a bias towards more competitive applicants. The factors associated with increased interview offer rate were: Step 1 score, Step 2 score, number of research items, class quartile, and Alpha Omega Alpha membership. Logistic regression modeling correctly predicted an applicant matching to their first-choice program with 74.7% accuracy, with significant negative predictors being the number of programs to which the applicant applied and interviews offered from waitlist or cancellations, and positive predictors being the number of interview offers received. Conclusions: Many applicants "apply broadly" with the goal of improving their match outcomes, but we found that applying to more programs is associated with a decreased likelihood of the applicant matching to their first-choice program. Applicant characteristics such as United States Medical Licensing Examination (R) scores were not related to first-choice match, suggesting that program selection, among other factors, is vital in the match process.

National Imaging Trends in Nephrolithiasis-Does Renal Ultrasound in the Emergency Department Pave the Way for Computerized Tomography?	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						kidney calculi; radiation exposure; diagnostic imaging	SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; STONES; RECURRENCE	Introduction: Concern regarding radiation exposure has led to increased interest in the use of ultrasound for the initial imaging of suspected renal colic in the emergency department. It is unknown whether such an approach simply defers computerized tomography to outpatient followup. We analyzed national imaging patterns to explore this relationship. Methods: Using the MarketScan (R) insurance claims database we reviewed adult patients newly diagnosed with nephrolithiasis in U.S. emergency departments between 2007 and 2015. Patients were excluded if they had been diagnosed with or undergone treatment for nephrolithiasis in the preceding 180 days. Results: From 2007 to 2015, 830,785 emergency department nephrolithiasis encounters met inclusion criteria. The ultrasound-only rate increased from 2.7% to 6.9%, while the computerized tomography-only rate remained stable at 85.8%. A history of computerized tomography in the 30 days before emergency department presentation increased the rate of ultrasound-only imaging from 4.6% to 8.9%. The mean cumulative computerized tomography scans from the emergency department visit to 90 days after was significantly lower in those imaged with emergency department ultrasound (0.82 +/- 0.77) compared to those imaged with emergency department computerized tomography (1.2 +/- 0.51, p <0.001). Conclusions: Patients who undergo ultrasonography in the emergency department for evaluation of renal colic undergo fewer cumulative computerized tomography scans in the 90 days following their visit than do patients initially imaged with computerized tomography. Ultrasound use for the evaluation of renal colic has increased while computerized tomography rates have remained stable.

J	Lee, MS; Assmus, M; Agarwal, D; Large, T; Krambeck, A				Lee, Matthew S.; Assmus, Mark; Agarwal, Deepak; Large, Tim; Krambeck, Amy			A Cost Comparison of Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate with and without Moses (TM)	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						prostatic hyperplasia; costs and cost analysis	TRANSURETHRAL RESECTION; OUTCOMES	Introduction: Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) is a size-independent treatment option for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. HoLEP has been shown to have excellent improvements in prostate symptom scores and maximum flow rates that have been durable for 2 decades. However, the steep learning curve associated with HoLEP has prevented its widespread adoption. New advancements in lasers, specifically the Moses (TM) pulse-modulation technology, have resulted in improvements in hemostasis and achieving same-day discharges and catheter removals. We aimed to perform a cost-comparison to analyze if Moses-augmented HoLEP (m-HoLEP) resulted in cost-savings. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of a single expert surgeon's experience from May 2018 to November 2020, comparing m-HoLEP with HoLEP. Perioperative and postoperative variables were abstracted from the medical record. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using SAS (R) 9.4. Two-sided significance was set at p <0.05. Results: A total of 312 men underwent HoLEP during the study period (192 in m-HoLEP group and 120 in HoLEP group). The m-HoLEP group had more same-day discharges (p <0.001) and emergency department visits (6.3% vs 1.7%, p=0.0071). m-HoLEP resulted in hospital cost savings of $840 for the initial surgical episode (p=0.0297). When factoring in emergency department visits/readmissions, the cost savings decreased to $747 per case (p=0.0574). Conclusions: m-HoLEP was associated with same-day discharge and hospital cost savings of $840 for the initial surgical episode. Further study in other institutions with surgeons of varying experience levels will need to be performed to see if these findings can be replicated.

We compare the impact of immediate vs delayed recognition of IUIs on clinical, cost and health care utilization outcomes. Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study on patients who had a diagnosis of an IUI between 2003 and 2018. The primary independent variable was the time of diagnosis of IUI. The primary clinical outcomes evaluated included renal impairment and a composite outcome: hydronephrosis or stricture. Secondary outcomes included total direct health care costs and health care utilization. Results: We identified 1,193 patients who experienced an IUI, 25.2% of whom had a delay in recognition. Delayed recognition of IUI was associated with hydronephrosis or stricture within 1 year following treatment of IUI (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.69-3.04, p <0.0001) and renal impairment within 2 years following treatment of IUI (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.84-3.94, p <0.0001) compared to immediate diagnosis. Total health care costs (incident rate ratio [IRR] 2.06, 95% CI 1.89-2.24, p <0.0001), emergency department visits (IRR 2.07, 95% CI 1.77-2.43, p <0.0001), hospitalizations (IRR 1.62, 95% CI 1.48-1.78, p <0.0001) and outpatient urology visits (IRR 1.45, 95% CI 1.31-1.60, p <0.0001) were significantly higher in those with delayed recognition compared to immediate. Previous radiation was significantly associated with delayed recognition of IUI (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.97, p=0.04). Conclusions: Delayed recognition of IUI is associated with significant clinical, cost and health care utilization consequences.

Patient Perceptions of Telephonic Visits during the COVID-19 Pandemic-Is Video Connectivity Imperative?	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						telemedicine; telephone; COVID-19; internship and residency; physicians assistants; nurse practitioners	TELEMEDICINE; SATISFACTION; CARE	Introduction: We characterize patient perceptions of telemedicine (video-enabled) and telephonic (audio-only) visits conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A single-center cohort of 76 patients who underwent remote ambulatory visits from March 2020 to July 2020 was evaluated. Patients responded to a questionnaire assessing perception of timeliness, efficiency, overall satisfaction and willingness to have a remote appointment after the pandemic. Responses were compared for telephonic (audio-only) vs telemedicine (video) visits. Results: High satisfaction scores were reported for both telephonic and telemedicine appointments, with a mean score of 6.61 out of 7 (SD 1.0) for overall satisfaction. Telephonic visits demonstrated higher scores regarding timeliness and efficiency of the visit (6.58 vs 5.92, p=0.017) and willingness to have a remote encounter with a urology resident (6.58 vs 5.61, p=0.001) or advanced practice provider (6.21 vs 5.51, p=0.015). No difference in perception of confidentiality or overall satisfaction was observed between both groups. In all, 91% of participants desired the option of a virtual visit with their provider after the pandemic. Conclusions: Patients undergoing remote urology appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic report high satisfaction rates, though telephonic encounters were more favorable for patients in regard to timeliness and efficiency. Importantly, most patients desired the option of telephonic and telemedicine calls after the pandemic. Further analysis on safety, efficacy, provider perceptions, outcomes and economic impact is needed to assess the feasibility of continuing regular telephonic and telemedicine visits after the COVID-19 pandemic is over.

The Impact of Comorbidity and Age on Timing of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Men with Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						androgen antagonists; health services research; comorbidity; age factors; prostatic neoplasms	CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; HORMONAL-THERAPY; CANCER; METAANALYSIS; ASSOCIATION; MORTALITY; DEATH; RISK	Introduction: Older men with major comorbidities have higher risks of morbidity and mortality from androgen deprivation therapy, and the benefits of immediate androgen deprivation therapy after biochemical recurrence in these men are unclear. We assessed variation in timing of androgen deprivation therapy by age and comorbidity in a cohort of men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Methods: We analyzed 2,097 men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy from 2000 to 2017 in the VA SEARCH database. We ascertained age and Deyo-Charlson comorbidity index scores at biochemical recurrence. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to determine association of age and Deyo-Charlson comorbidity index with prostate specific antigen at the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Results: In Kaplan-Meier analysis with prostate specific antigen at androgen deprivation therapy as the outcome, median prostate specific antigen at androgen deprivation therapy initiation was 6.2 ng/ml (95% CI 5.1-7.1) across all patients but differed among those who received adjuvant/salvage radiation (3.6 ng/ml, 95% CI 2.8-4.3) and those who did not (12.1 ng/ml, 95% CI 9.6-15.2, p <0.001). In multivariable Cox regression, advanced age (p=0.03) but not worse comorbidity (p=0.25) was associated higher prostate specific antigen at initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Across all patients, prostate specific antigen at androgen deprivation therapy was lower among those <60 years old (3.7 ng/ml, 95% CI 2.6-5.8) compared to those 60-64 (5.0 ng/ml, 95% CI 3.9-6.6), 65-69 (6.6 ng/ml, 95% CI 4.9-8.8), 70-74 (8.8 ng/ml, 95% CI 6.1-12.3) and >= 75 years old (14.1 ng/ml, 95% CI 5.5-37.8). In contrast, prostate specific antigen at androgen deprivation therapy was similar among comorbidity subgroups (Deyo-Charlson comorbidity index 0: 6.3 ng/ml, 95% CI 5.0-7.9 vs Deyo-Charlson comorbidity index 3 or higher: 5.6 ng/ml, 95% CI 4.1-7.4). In general, these relationships were consistent among subgroups receiving adjuvant/salvage radiation. Conclusions: Men with comorbid disease at increased risk of morbidity and mortality with androgen deprivation therapy often receive androgen deprivation therapy at low prostate specific antigen values.

Use of Bladder Sparing Surgery for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer by Life Expectancy at Diagnosis	UROLOGY PRACTICE			English	Article						organ sparing treatments; urinary bladder neoplasms; life expectancy; comorbidity	LONG-TERM OUTCOMES; COMBINED-MODALITY THERAPY; RADICAL CYSTECTOMY; TRIMODAL THERAPY; CHEMOTHERAPY; MANAGEMENT; SCORE	Introduction: Patients who are older and sicker are ideal candidates for bladder sparing therapy for muscle invasive bladder cancer given risks of treatment related morbidity with radical cystectomy and cancer mortality with observation. However, little is known about the independent impact of age, comorbidity and life expectancy on utilization of bladder sparing therapy. Methods: We sampled 19,228 patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 from the National Cancer Database. We used multivariable multinomial logistic regression to determine relative risk ratios and predicted probabilities of receipt of bladder sparing therapy by estimates of life expectancy, and by age and comorbidity at diagnosis. Results: On multivariable analysis decreasing life expectancy was significantly associated with higher use of bladder sparing compared with cystectomy (relative RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.07-1.08). However, absolute changes were modest with predicted probability of bladder sparing increasing from 8%, 10%, 12%, 14% and 17% among patients with 25-year, 20-year, 15-year, 10-year and 5-year life expectancies, respectively. By comparison, rates of cystectomy decreased from 54%, 47%, 39%, 32% and 26% and rates of observation increased from 22%, 26%, 31%, 36% and 40% across the same life expectancy subgroups, respectively. Age had a stronger effect on relative risk of bladder sparing than comorbidity. Predicted probabilities of bladder sparing therapy increased from 8%, 12%, 16% and 19% among 60-year-old, 70-year-old, 80-year-old and 90-year-old patients, respectively, while the probability was 13%, 13% and 15% among patients with Charlson scores of 0, 1, and 2+, respectively. Conclusions: Bladder sparing therapy is underused in patients who are older and sicker with limited life expectancy who currently primarily receive observation or, less often, radical cystectomy.
