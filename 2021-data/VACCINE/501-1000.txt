The more vaccine doses are delivered to users, the more common adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are reported. This study aimed to identify factors affecting AEFI in Vietnamese people receiving the COVID-19 vaccine AZD1222 developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. Methods: In July 2021, an online cross-sectional survey was conducted among Vietnamese who have been vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines. The questionnaire collected demographic characteristics, medical history, types of injected vaccines, common AEFI, and post-vaccination activities from respondents. The effects of host-related factors on AEFI including 24 specific symptoms were also explored. Results: After screening, 1028 participants who were Vietnamese, over 18 years old and received at least one dose of AZD1222, were included in the study. Only 40/1028 (3.9%) participants reported not having any AEFI, whereas 25/1028 (2.4%) reported to have severe symptoms. The most common AEFI were moderate fever (69.4%), muscle aches (68.6%), followed by fatigue/ sleepiness (62.5%), body aches (59.4%), headache (58.5%), pain at injection site (58.3%) and chills (45.7%). Data analysis showed that females complained about AEFI particularly gastrointestinal symptoms more frequently than males. Age of participants and number of doses were also important factors affecting AEFI as the increase of age or number of vaccine doses was associated with the decrease of self-reported AEFI frequency. Conclusions: This study provides a detailed assessment of risk factors associated with AEFI in Vietnamese people vaccinated with AZD1222. It seems that gender, age and vaccine doses are important factors affecting AEFI. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bangladesh is intermediate endemic country for Hepatitis B infection for which the government has introduced hepatitis B vaccination into the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) nationwide since 2009 for new born children. However, the people who were born before 2009, was dependent on imported hepatitis B vaccine as there was no locally manufactured hepatitis B vaccine in Bangladesh. Hence, we conducted a randomized observer blinded non-inferiority clinical trial to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the locally manufactured Hepa-B vaccine in comparison with World Health Organization prequalified Engerix-B vaccine. Total 158 eligible adult participants were enrolled in this study with mean age of 30 and 29 years old in Hepa-B and Engerix-B groups, respectively. Both the vaccines were administered intramuscularly at 0, 1 and 6 months schedule. Baseline and post vaccination anti-HBs titers were measure at different time points. Seroconversion rate post three doses of Hepa-B vaccine was 98.67% similar to the comparator Engerix-B vaccine which was 100%. The geometric mean test ratios of both vaccines at all analysis time points were found > 0.5 predefined non-inferiority margin. Soreness at the injection site was the most common symptom for both the vaccines which resolved without any complication. No serious adverse event was reported throughout the study period. These results suggest that locally manufactured hepatitis B vaccine 'Hepa-B' vaccine is non-inferior to the well-known licensed 'Engerix-B' vaccine. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03627507.

Willingness to get a flu shot was higher among subjects invited to imagine themselves working at the local health authority (LHA) with the greatest immunization coverage within their region relative to their counterparts prompted to imagine working at the LHA with the lowest coverage. Reminding the impact of flu vaccination on beneficiaries had differ-ent effects across job families, with physicians caring more benefits for themselves, nurses about patients' benefits, and technicians about family and friends. Default responses anchoring toward a high rather than a low vaccination intention increased the willingness to immunize among all HCW except physicians. Targeted nudges can be considered in developing interventions to promote influenza vaccination among HCWs. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With > 250 million people infected worldwide and approximately 800 million people at risk, the World Health Organization considers schistosomiasis to be the most important human helminth infection. Several prophylactic non-living vaccines are in pre-clinical and clinical development, but only one has been assessed for therapeutic effect in an animal model with modest results. Live attenuated Salmonella have multiple potential advantages as vaccine vectors. We have engineered an attenuated Salmonella enterica Typhimurium strain (YS1646) to produce a vaccine that targets the parasite digestive enzyme Cathepsin B (CatB). A multi-modality immunization schedule was used in chronically infected mice that included three oral (PO) doses of this CatB-bearing YS1646 strain on days one, three, and five as well as an intramuscular (IM) dose of recombinant CatB on day one. Parasite burden (worm count, intestinal and liver egg numbers) were 46.5 - 50.3% lower than in control animals 1 month post vaccination and relative reductions further increased to 63.9 - 73.3% at 2 months. Serum anti-CatB IgG increased significantly after vaccination with the development of a more balanced TH1/TH2 pattern of response (ie: a shift in the IgG1:IgG2c ratio). Compared to control animals, a broad and robust CatBspecific cytokine/chemokine response was seen in splenocytes isolated 1 month post-vaccination. A vaccine that has both prophylactic and therapeutic activity would be ideal for use in conjunction with mass treatment campaigns with praziquantel in schistosome-endemic countries.

Currently, no specific drugs and vaccines are available, and a safe and effective CVB5 vaccine is of great value for control of the diseases. In this study, CVB5 P1 precursor and 3CD protease were co-expressed in Sf9 cells by using a baculovirus expression system. The P1 was processed by 3CD and self-assembled into CVB5 virus-like particles (VLPs). VP1 and VP3 capsid proteins of CVB5 could be detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the CVB5 VLPs were spherical particles with a diameter of about 30 nm, mimicking wild-type CVB5 virus. Our study showed that the total IgG and neutralizing antibodies induced by CVB5 VLPs were higher than those induced by inactivated vaccine. More importantly, the CVB5 VLPs conferred full protection to the CVB5-challenged suckling mice via passive immunity while protection efficiency of the inactivated vaccine was only 80%. The CVB5 VLPs vaccine could protect the limb muscles, brain, and heart tissues of suckling mice from CVB5-induced damage. These results demonstrated that the CVB5 VLPs vaccine possessed stronger immunogenicity and provided more robust immunoprotection than the inactivated CVB5 vaccine, suggesting that the CVB5 VLPs promise to be a CVB5 vaccine candidate in future.

ICD-10 anaphylaxis algorithm and the estimate of vaccine-attributable anaphylaxis incidence in Medicare	VACCINE			English	Article						Anaphylaxis; ICD-10; Vaccine; Claims-data; Medicare Fee For Service; Algorithm; Positive predictive value (PPV)	EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; INTERVAL ESTIMATION; FATAL ANAPHYLAXIS; RISK	Background: Anaphylaxis is a rare, serious allergic reaction. Its identification in large healthcare data-bases can help better characterize this risk. Objective: To create an ICD-10 anaphylaxis algorithm, estimate its positive predictive values (PPVs) in a post-vaccination risk window, and estimate vaccination-attributable anaphylaxis rates in the Medicare Fee For Service (FFS) population. Methods: An anaphylaxis algorithm with core and extended portions was constructed analyzing ICD-10 anaphylaxis claims data in Medicare FFS from 2015 to 2017. Cases of post-vaccination anaphylaxis among Medicare FFS beneficiaries were then identified from October 1, 2015 to February 28, 2019 utiliz-ing vaccine relevant anaphylaxis ICD-10 codes. Information from medical records was used to determine true anaphylaxis cases based on the Brighton Collaboration's anaphylaxis case definition. PPVs were esti-mated for incident anaphylaxis and the subset of vaccine-attributable anaphylaxis within a 2-day post-vaccination risk window. Vaccine-attributable anaphylaxis rates in Medicare FFS were also estimated. Results: The study recorded 66,572,128 vaccinations among 21,685,119 unique Medicare FFS beneficia-ries. The algorithm identified a total of 190 suspected anaphylaxis cases within the 2-day post-vaccination window; of these 117 (62%) satisfied the core algorithm, and 73 (38%) additional cases sat-isfied the extended algorithm. The core algorithm's PPV was 66% (95% CI [56%, 76%]) for identifying inci-dent anaphylaxis and 44% (95% CI [34%, 56%]) for vaccine-attributable anaphylaxis. The vaccine-attributable anaphylaxis incidence rate after any vaccination was 0.88 per million doses (95% CI [0.67, 1.16]). Conclusion: The ICD-10 claims algorithm for anaphylaxis allows the assessment of anaphylaxis risk in real-world data. The algorithm revealed vaccine-attributable anaphylaxis is rare among vaccinated Medicare FFS beneficiaries. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of our study was to focus on the tolerance of this vaccine this population. Methods: An anonymous self-reporting survey related to safety and tolerance of vaccine was completed by subjects 21 to 28 days after the first vaccine dose in two vaccination centers. Results: Subjects with prior COVID-19 disease history (n = 61) had higher systemic reactions than subjects without any previous history (n = 1987) (45.9% vs 29.7%, p = 0.01). Asthenia, headache and fever were significantly more frequent in COVID-19 + group than negative group (25.6% vs 15.2% p = 0.045, 19.7% vs 9.3% p = 0.01, 6.5% vs 0.9% p = 0.003 respectively). Grade of severity was higher in COVID19 + than in COVID-19 -group (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Our study confirms a higher risk of side effects in patients with preexisting SARS-CoV-2 disease but with a good overall tolerance. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We evaluated changes on serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of pneumococci carried by children living in two regions of Portugal (one urban and one rural). Three epidemiological periods were defined: pre-PCV13 (2009-2010), early-PCV13 (2011-2012), and late-PCV13 (2015-2016). Nasopharyngeal samples (n = 4,232) were obtained from children 0-6 years old attending day-care centers. Private use of PCVs was very high in both regions (>75%). Pneumococcal carriage remained stable and high over time (62.1%, 62.4% and 61.6% (p = 0.909) in the urban region; and 59.8%, 62.8%, 59.5% (p = 0.543) in the rural region). Carriage of PCV7 serotypes remained low (5.3%, 7.8% and 4.3% in the urban region; and 2.5%, 3.7% and 4.8% in the rural region). Carriage of PCV13 serotypes not targeted by PCV7 decreased in both the urban (16.4%, 7.3%, and 1.6%; p < 0.001) and rural regions (13.2%, 7.8%, and 1.9%; p < 0.001). This decline was mostly attributable to serotype 19A (14.1%, 4.4% and 1.3% in the urban region; and 11.1%, 3.6% and 0.8% in the rural region, both p < 0.001). Serotype 3 declined over time in the urban region (10.1%, 4.4%, 0.8%; p < 0.001) and had no obvious trend in the rural region (4.2%, 6.7%, 2.4%; p = 0.505). Serotype 6C decreased in both regions while serotypes 11D, 15A/B/C, 16F, 21, 22F, 23A/B, 24F, 35F, and NT were the most prevalent in the late-PCV13 period. Intermediate resistance to penicillin and non-susceptibility to erythromycin decreased significantly in both regions (19.5%, 13.3%, and 9.3%; and 25.4%, 25.9%, and 13.4%; both p < 0.001, respectively in the urban region; and 12.4%, 11.1%, and 2.8% (p < 0.001); and 15.3%, 14.7%, and 9.2% (p = 0.037), respectively, in the rural region). In conclusion, private use of PCV13 led to significant changes on the pneumococcal population carried by children in Portugal. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report the extended follow up of safety and efficacy over 2 years. Methods: A total of 1849 (GMZ2 = 926, rabies = 923) children aged 12-60 months were randomized to receive intramuscularly, either 3 doses of 100 mu g GMZ2/alum or 3 doses of rabies vaccine as control 28 days apart. The children were followed-up for 24 months for clinical malaria episodes and adverse events. The primary endpoint was documented fever with parasitaemia of at least 5000/mu L. Results: There were 2,062 malaria episodes in the GMZ2/alum group and 2,115 in the rabies vaccine group in the intention-to-treat analysis, vaccine efficacy (VE) of 6.5% (95%: CI -1.6%, 14.0%). In children aged 1-2 years at enrolment, VE was 3.6% (95 %CI: -9.1%, 14.8%) in the first year and -4.1% (95 %CI: -18.7%, 87%) in the second year. In children aged 3-5 years at enrolment VE was 19.9% (95 %CI: 7.7%, 30.4%) in the first year and 6.3% (95 %CI: -10.2%, 20.3%) in the second year (interaction by year, P = 0.025, and by age group, P = 0.085). A total of 187 (GMZ2 = 91, rabies = 96) serious adverse events were recorded in 167 individuals over the entire period of the study. There were no GMZ2 vaccine related serious adverse events. Conclusions: GMZ2/alum was well tolerated. Follow-up over 2 years confirmed a low level of vaccine efficacy with slightly higher efficacy in older children, which suggests GMZ2 may act in concert with naturally acquired immunity.

Should older adult pneumococcal vaccination recommendations change due to decreased vaccination in children during the pandemic? A cost-effectiveness analysis	VACCINE			English	Article						Pneumococcal vaccination; Elderly; Cost-effectiveness analysis; COVID-19	POLYSACCHARIDE VACCINE; ADVISORY-COMMITTEE; CONJUGATE VACCINE	Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is causing declines in childhood immunization rates. We examined potential COVID-19-related changes in pediatric 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) use, subsequent impact on childhood and adult pneumococcal disease rates, and how those changes might affect the favorability of PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised adults aged >65 years. Methods: A Markov model estimated pediatric disease resulting from decreased PCV13 use in children aged <5 years; absolute decreases from 10 to 50% for 1-2 years duration were examined, assuming no catch-up vaccination and that decreased vaccination led to proportionate increases in PCV13 serotype pneumococcal disease in children and seniors. Integrating pediatric model output into a second Markov model examining 65-year-olds, we estimated the cost effectiveness of older adult pneumococcal vaccination strategies while accounting for potential epidemiologic changes from decreased pediatric vaccination. Results: One year of 10-50% absolute decreases in PCV13 use in <5-year-olds increased pneumococcal disease by an estimated 4-19% in seniors; 2 years of decreased use increased senior rates by 8-38%. In seniors, a >53% increase in pneumococcal disease was required to favor PCV13 use in nonimmunocompromised seniors at a $200,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained threshold, which corresponded to absolute decreases in pediatric PCV13 vaccination of >50% over a 2-year period. In sensitivity analyses, senior PCV13 vaccination was unfavorable if absolute decreases in pediatric PCV13 receipt were within plausible ranges, despite model assumptions favoring PCV13 use in seniors. Conclusion: COVID-19-related decreases in pediatric PCV13 use would need to be both substantial and prolonged to make heightened PCV13 use in non-immunocompromised seniors economically favorable.

We report six cases of myocarditis, which occurred shortly after BNT162b2 vaccination. Methods: Patients were identified upon presentation to the emergency department with symptoms of chest pain/discomfort. In all study patients, we excluded past and current COVID-19. Routine clinical and laboratory investigations for common etiologies of myocarditis were performed. Laboratory tests also included troponin and C-reactive protein levels. The diagnosis of myocarditis was established after cardiac MRI. Findings: Five patients presented after the second and one after the first dose of the vaccine. All patients were males with a median age of 23 years. Myocarditis was diagnosed in all patients, there was no evidence of COVID-19 infection. Laboratory assays excluded concomitant infection; autoimmune disorder was considered unlikely. All patients responded to the BNT162b2 vaccine. The clinical course was mild in all six patients. Interpretation: Our report of myocarditis after BNT162b2 vaccination may be possibly considered as an adverse reaction following immunization. We believe our information should be interpreted with caution and further surveillance is warranted. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Addressing logistical barriers to childhood vaccination using an automated reminder system and online resource intervention: A randomized controlled trial	VACCINE			English	Article						Logistical Barriers; Automated reminders; Randomized controlled trial; Qualitative interviews	AGED 19-35 MONTHS; UNITED-STATES; IMMUNIZATION RATES; CHILDREN; COVERAGE; POPULATION; VACCINES; PROGRAM; CARE	Background: As the rates of vaccination decline in children with logistical barriers to vaccination, new strategies to increase vaccination are needed. The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of the Vaccines For Babies (VFB) intervention, an automated reminder system with online resources to address logistical barriers to vaccination in caregivers of children enrolled in an integrated healthcare system. Effectiveness was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with parents of children less than two years old to identify logistical barriers to vaccination that were used to develop the VFB intervention. VFB included automated reminders to schedule the 6-and 12-month vaccine visit linking caregivers to resources to address logistic barriers, sent to the preferred mode of outreach (text, email, and/or phone). Parents of children between 3 and 10 months of age with indicators of logistical barriers to vaccination were randomized to receive VFB or usual well child care (UC). The primary outcome was percentage of days undervaccinated at 2 years of life. A difference in differences analysis was conducted. Results: Qualitative interviews with 6 parents of children less than 2 years of age identified transportation, scheduling challenges, and knowledge of vaccine timing as logistical barriers to vaccination. We enrolled 250 participants in the trial, 45% were loss to follow-up. There were no significant differences in vaccination uptake between those enrolled in UC or the VFB intervention (0.51%, p = 0.86). In Medicaid enrolled participants, there was a modest decrease in percentage of days undervaccinated in the VFB intervention compared to UC (6.3%, p = 0.07). Conclusion: Automated Reminders and with links to heath system resources was not shown to increase infant vaccination uptake demonstrating additional resources are needed to address the needs of caregivers experiencing logistical barriers to vaccination.

A recent HIV-1 soluble envelope trimer vaccine candidate, BG505 DS-SOSIP.664, is among the most glycosylated proteins to enter a clinical trial to date, and determination of its protein and glycan molecular weight is one of the key attributes in pre-clinical characterization. However, protein and glycans possess disparate (dn/dc)values making molecular weight measurement inaccurate in conventional SEC-MALS. To overcome these challenges, a simple mathematically guided experiment was explored, and a composite (dn/dc)value was established by utilizing protein and glycan mass contributions for the HIV-1 envelope trimer. This establishment was further verified by an orthogonal mass spectrometry analysis. This innovative, simple, and quick analytical approach can be applied broadly to measuring the molecular weight of various composite molecular structures, such as complex glycoconjugates.

Does influenza vaccination attenuate the severity of breakthrough infections? A narrative review and recommendations for further research	VACCINE			English	Review						Influenza; Vaccination; Vaccine effectiveness; Severity	LABORATORY-CONFIRMED INFLUENZA; H1N1 INFLUENZA; OLDER-ADULTS; EFFICACY; OUTCOMES; DISEASE; HOSPITALIZATION; PATHOGENESIS; CHILDREN; ILLNESS	The effect of influenza vaccination on influenza severity remains uncertain. We reviewed the literature for evidence to inform the question of whether influenza illness is less severe among individuals who received influenza vaccination compared with individuals with influenza illness who were unvaccinated prior to their illnesses. We conducted a narrative review to identify published findings comparing severity of influenza outcomes by vaccination status among community-dwelling adults and children > 6 months of age with laboratory-confirmed influenza illness. When at least four effect estimates of the same type (e.g., odds ratio) were available for a specific outcome and age category (children versus adults), data were pooled with meta-analysis to generate a summary effect estimate. We identified 38 published articles reporting > 1 association between influenza vaccination status and one of 21 indicators of severity of influenza illness among individuals with laboratory-confirmed influenza. Study methodologies and effect estimates were highly heterogenous, with only five severity indicators meeting criteria for calculating a combined effect. Among eight studies, influenza vaccination was associated with 26% reduction in odds of ICU admission among adults with influenza-associated hospitalization (OR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.58, 0.93). Among five studies of adults with influenza-associated hospitalization, vaccinated patients had 31% reduced risk of death compared with unvaccinated patients (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.52, 0.92). Among four studies of children with influenza virus infection, vaccination was associated with an estimated 45% reduction in the odds of manifesting fever (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.42, 0.71). Vaccination was not significantly associated with receiving a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia among adults hospitalized with influenza (OR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.82, 1.04) or with risk of hospitalization following outpatient influenza illness among adults (OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.28, 1.28). Overall, our findings support the hypothesis that influenza vaccination may attenuate the course of disease among individuals with breakthrough influenza virus infection . Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Due to a local manufacturing shortage of BCG Moreau, BCG Russia was introduced in 2017 by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Objective: To evaluate differences in immune responses induced by BCG Moreau and BCG Russia in infants, in addition to scar formation. Methods: The present case series involved 15 healthy infants who were vaccinated within the first seven days of life with one of two strains of BCG, then followed for 12 weeks or longer. Cytokine levels were measured before and after vaccination in whole blood culture supernatants previously stimulated in vitro with either BCG strain, heat-killed M. tuberculosis H37Rv or in the absence of stimulation. BCG scarring was also documented. Results: Infants vaccinated with BCG Moreau exhibited increased background IL-2, IL-10 and IL-4 production, yet no differences were found in those vaccinated with BCG Russia. Although both strains induced higher levels of IL-2 and IFN-gamma, elevated IL-6, TNF and IL-10 production was also seen in response to BCG Russia. In contrast, no specific responses were observed against heat-killed M. tuberculosis H37Rv, with the exception of increased IL-2 following BCG Moreau vaccination. Although documented in both groups, scarring was milder and less frequent following BCG Russia vaccination. Conclusions: Similar Th1 profiles were found following immunization with either type of BCG vaccine evaluated herein, with more pronounced cytokine production detected in response to the Russia strain. Overall, vaccination was well-tolerated and scarring evolved as expected for both BCG strains. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Implementation of the World Health Organization recommendation on the use of rotavirus vaccine without age restriction by African countries	VACCINE			English	Article						Rotavirus; Vaccine; Age restriction removal	DOUBLE-BLIND; EFFICACY; CHILDREN; PROGRAMS; SAFETY	The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the worldwide use of rotavirus vaccines initially in 2007 and 2009 applying a strict age restriction criterion due to the potential for age-related association with increased risk of intussusception in infants. The restriction was relaxed in the 2013 after detailed review of robust safety data generated in post-marketing surveillance studies. We assessed the status of the implementation of the 2013 recommendation to remove age restriction in the WHO African region (AFR). Of the approximately 75% (35/47) of countries that had introduced the vaccine by 2018, only 43% (15/35) removed age restriction, exclusively from South and East sub-region (78%, 14/18). Avoiding con -fusion at the health facilities and financial constraints particularly resources required for re-training the health workers, use of vaccine off-label were cited as the main reasons for not implementing the 2013 WHO recommendation on age restriction removal. The 2013 WHO recommendation has not been fully implemented by African countries, suggesting the need for technical advisory bodies to further guide the countries, continue monitoring the implementation status and impact on the rotavirus vaccine cov-erage and intussusception in the Africa region.

The impact of paid family leave on the timely vaccination of infants	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccination; Paid parental leave; Difference-in-difference; Synthetic control method	CHILD HEALTH; MATERNITY LEAVE; PARENTAL LEAVE; CALIFORNIA; EMPLOYMENT	Time constraints parents face can affect whether infant children are vaccinated on time. Using the National Immunization Survey, we employ a synthetic control difference-in-difference estimation technique to establish a causal relationship arising from California's implementation of Paid Parental Leave Program as a natural experiment. We find California Paid Family Leave reduced late vaccinations by up to 5 percentage points or approximately 10% for children born to parents in California after the policy was implemented. Further, the policy had a stronger impact on families below the poverty line. Thus access to paid family leave can improve on-time immunization of infants. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Pullan, S; Dey, M				Pullan, Samuel; Dey, Mrinalini			Vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccination in the time of COVID-19: A Google Trends analysis	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine hesitancy; Anti-vaccination; Google trends; Vaccine safety; Vaccine uptake		The COVID-19 pandemic has produced many calls for a vaccine. There is growing concern that vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccination presence will dampen the uptake of a coronavirus vaccine. There are many cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Mercury content, autism association, and vaccine danger have been commonly found in anti-vaccination messages. It is also mused that the reduced disease burden from infectious diseases has paradoxically reduced the perceived requirement for vaccine uptake. Our analysis using Google Trends has shown that throughout the pandemic the search interest in a coronavirus vaccine has increased and remained high throughout. Peaks are found when public declarations are made, the case number increases significantly, or when vaccine breakthroughs are announced. Anti-vaccine searches, in the context of COVID-19, have had a continued and growing presence during the pandemic.

J	Verelst, F; Beutels, P; Hens, N; Willem, L				Verelst, Frederik; Beutels, Philippe; Hens, Niel; Willem, Lander			Workplace influenza vaccination to reduce employee absenteeism: An economic analysis from the employers' perspective	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccination; Workplace; Influenza; Cost-benefit analysis; Absenteeism; Employee	SEASONAL INFLUENZA; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; SOCIAL CONTACTS; WORKING ADULTS; TRANSMISSION; ILLNESS; EFFICACY; IMPACT; PARAMETERS; VACCINES	Background: Each year, up to 10% of unvaccinated adults contracts seasonal influenza, with half of this proportion developing symptoms. As a result, employers experience significant economic losses in terms of employee absenteeism. Influenza vaccines can be instrumental in reducing this burden. Workplace vaccination is expected to reduce employee absenteeism more than linearly as a result of positive externalities. It remains unclear whether workplace influenza vaccination yields a positive return on investment. Methods: We simulated the spread of influenza in the seasons 2011-12 up to 2017-18 in Belgium by means of a compartmental transmission model. We accounted for age-specific social contact patterns and included reduced contact behavior when symptomatically infected. We simulated the impact of employer-funded influenza vaccination at the workplace and performed a cost-benefit analysis to assess the employers' return on workplace vaccination. Furthermore, we look into the cost-benefit of rewarding vaccinated employees by offering an additional day off. Results: Workplace vaccination reduced the burden of influenza both on the workplace and in the population at large. Compared to the current vaccine coverage - 21% in the population at large - an employee vaccine coverage of 90% could avert an additional 355 000 cases, of which about 150 000 in the employed population and 205 000 in the unemployed population. While seasonal influenza vaccination has been cost-saving on average at about (SIC)10 per vaccinated employee, the cost-benefit analysis was prone to between-season variability. Conclusions: Vaccinated employees can serve as a barrier to limit the spread of influenza in the population, reducing the attack rate by 78% at an employee coverage of 90%. While workplace vaccination is relatively inexpensive (due to economies of scale) and convenient, the return on investment is volatile. Government subsidies can be pivotal to encourage employers to provide vaccination at the workplace with positive externalities to society as a whole. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Perspectives on the receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine: A survey of employees in two large hospitals in Philadelphia	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Vaccine; Health care workers; Risk factors; Vaccine safety; Vaccine acceptance; Vaccine hesitancy	UNITED-STATES; RECOMMENDATION	Background: Health care personnel have been identified by the ACIP as a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. We conducted a survey in November-December 2020 at two large, academic hospitals in Philadelphia to evaluate the intention of hospital employees to be vaccinated. Methods: The survey was sent electronically to all employees (clinical and nonclinical staff) at a children's hospital and an adult hospital. The survey was voluntary and confidential. Questions focused on plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when available, reasons why employees would/would not get vaccinated, when employees planned to be vaccinated, vaccine safety and efficacy features that would be acceptable, and past history of receipt of other vaccines by the employee and family. Responses were analyzed using univariate and multiple logistic regression methods. Results: A total of 12,034 hospital employees completed the survey (a 34.5% response rate). Overall, 63.7% of employees reported that they planned to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, 26.3% were unsure, and 10.0% did not plan to be vaccinated. Over 80% of those unsure or unwilling to be vaccinated expressed concerns about vaccine side effects and the vaccines' newness. In multivariable logistic regression, persons planning to take a COVID-19 vaccine were more likely to be older, male, more educated, Asian or White, up-to-date on vaccinations, without direct patient contact, and tested for COVID-19 in the past. No significant difference in intention to be vaccinated was found between those with higher versus lower levels of exposure to COVID-19 patients or the number of previous exposures to patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: While the majority of hospital employees are planning to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, many are unsure or not planning to do so. Further education of hospital employees about the safety, efficacy, and value of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines is critical to vaccine acceptance in this population. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This study reviews the relative vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (rVE) of high-dose inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3) compared to standard-dose influenza vaccines (SD-IIV) in adults aged >= 65 years against influenza-associated outcomes. Additional sub-analyses of HD-IIV3 rVE were performed by the pre >= dominantly circulating influenza strain and the antigenic match or mismatch of the vaccine against the predominant circulating strains. Methods: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted for studies assessing the rVE of HD-IIV3 against probable/laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI), hospital admissions, and death in adults aged > 65 years. Results from individual seasons were extracted from the studies, and viral surveillance data were used to determine the dominant circulating strains and antigenic match for each season. Results were then stratified based on clinical outcomes and seasonal characteristics and meta-analyzed to estimate pooled rVEs of HD-IIV3. Results: 15 publications were meta-analyzed after screening 1,293 studies, providing data on 10 consecutive influenza seasons and over 22 million individuals receiving HD-IIV3 in randomized and observational settings. Across all influenza seasons, HD-IIV3 demonstrated improved protection against ILI compared to SD-IIV (rVE = 15.9%, 95% CI: 4.1-26.3%). HD-IIV3 was also more effective at preventing hospital admissions from all-causes (rVE = 8.4%, 95% CI: 5.7-11.0%), as well as influenza (rVE = 11.7%, 95% CI: 7.0-16.1%), pneumonia (rVE = 27.3%, 95% CI: 15.3-37.6%), combined pneumonia/influenza (rVE = 13.4%, 95% CI: 7.3-19.2%) and cardiorespiratory events (rVE = 17.9%, 95% CI: 15.0-20.8%). Reductions in mortality due to pneumonia/influenza (rVE = 39.9%, 95% CI: 18.6-55.6%) and cardiorespiratory causes (rVE = 27.7%, 95% CI: 13.2-32.0%) were also observed. Similar pooled rVEs were observed in both matched and mismatched seasons and in seasons where A/H3N2 or A/H1N1 strains were predominantly circulating. Conclusions: Evidence over 10 consecutive influenza seasons and in more than 34 million individuals aged >= 65 years suggests that HD-IIV3 is consistently more effective than SD-IIV at reducing influenza cases as well as influenza-associated clinical complications irrespective of circulating strain and antigenic match.

D.; Chambers, Mark A.; Lesellier, Sandrine			A combined measure of tuberculous lesions for assessing the efficacy of vaccination against tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) in European badgers (Meles meles) supports the 3Rs principle of reduction	VACCINE			English	Article						Regression; Statistical standardization; Covariates; Tuberculosis; Outbred; Experimental design		Background: An oral vaccine is a potential tool to tackle the reservoir of Mycobacterium bovis in European badgers (Meles meles), which contributes to tuberculosis of cattle in the British Isles. Inferences about vaccine protection against experimental challenge with M. bovis depend on the measurement of tuberculosis. Assessment of tuberculosis in larger species, such as badgers, is typically based on the tuberculous lesions visible at post-mortem examination and histopathology. We have developed a robust scoring system for tuberculous lesions by combining several parallel measures, which we call the "disease burden score" (DBS). Methods: Alternative scoring systems were compared within a regression analysis applied to observations from a total of 168 badgers from eight studies, including 107 badgers subjected to vaccination treatment and 61 non-vaccinated controls. The analysis included incidental observations that were recorded from each badger as potential covariate factors explaining some of the variation among animals sourced from the wild. Results: DBS was found to be the most accurate and reliable of the scoring systems compared. By taking account of significant covariates affecting disease, application of the DBS reduced residual variance by 22.9%. A previously used measure, based on assessment of visible lesions, was suboptimal due to non-uniform variance that increased with expected value, although square root transformation addressed this issue. The covariate model fitted to DBS included sex (males had higher DBS), weight (negatively associated with DBS) and immunological evidence of prior exposure to Mycobacterium avium (positively associated with DBS). Conclusions: We identified improved measures of tuberculous disease derived from data already collected. We also demonstrated that the proper scaling of measurements of disease in such models is necessary and can be determined empirically. The covariates which were most strongly associated with the severity of disease are important in experimental studies involving outbred animals with variable background.

Based on the genetic distance of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene of the influenza viruses to vaccine strains, we statistically quantified the relationship between the genetic mismatch and vaccine effectiveness (VE) for influenza A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2 and B. We also proposed a systematic approach to integrate multiple genes and influenza types for overall VE estimation. Evident linear relationships were identified and validated in independent data. The modelling framework may enable in silico prediction for VE on a real-time basis and inform the influenza vaccine selection strategy. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Birds from each group were separated at 17 and 18 woa and challenged orally with 10(6) CFU of S. Typhimurium. Both untreated and probiotic groups shed Salmonella until 56 days. Salmonella was also detected in dust from 8 until 12 woa but little after this. After vaccination, from sexual maturity (18 woa) all groups except those that were vaccinated with and without probiotic re-excreted Salmonella. The probiotic alone was ineffective against this re-excretion and all groups receiving organic acids shed Salmonella. At 17 woa, unchallenged controls were fully susceptible to caecal colonization, however all other groups showed reduced susceptibility, including the untreated challenged group. However, at 18 woa (sexual maturity) only the groups that were vaccinated with or without probiotic showed reduced susceptibility to colonization. The organic acid treated groups (including the vaccinated group) did not show a difference to the untreated controls. S. Typhimurium demonstrated an ability to re-emerge at sexual maturity, similar to other serovars. The vaccine assisted in limiting the reexcretion at sexual maturity and decreased susceptibility to subsequent challenge. Use of a probiotic augmented the vaccine's protective capacity.

Mice were immunized with 22F formulation and later colonized with Spn or co-infected with Spn and influenza virus. The 22F antisera exhibited strong reactivity to 22F bacteria and promoted the opsonic uptake of Spn by the neutrophils. The 22F vaccination led to a significant reduction of bacterial densities in the nasopharynx and prevented bacterial transmission during colonization and co-infection. The transfer of 22F antisera to infant mice resulted in reduced bacterial transmission in colonization and co-infection models. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Identification of patients at risk of Clostridioides difficile infection for enrollment in vaccine clinical trials	VACCINE			English	Article						Clostridioides difficile infection; Vaccine; Trial enrollment	HOSPITALIZED-PATIENTS; PREDICTIVE MODEL; VALIDATION; POPULATION; PREVENTION; TOXIN	Background: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an important cause of diarrheal disease associated with increasing morbidity and mortality. Efforts to develop a preventive vaccine are ongoing. The goal of this study was to develop an algorithm to identify patients at high risk of CDI for enrollment in a vaccine efficacy trial. Methods: We conducted a 2-stage retrospective study of patients aged >= 50 within the US Department of Veterans Affairs Health system between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013. Included patients had at least 1 visit in each of the 2 years prior to the study, with no CDI in the past year. We used multivariable logistic regression with elastic net regularization to identify predictors of CDI in months 2-12 (i.e., days 31 - 365) to allow time for antibodies to develop. Performance was measured using the positive predictive value (PPV) and the area under the curve (AUC). Results: Elements of the predictive algorithm included age, baseline comorbidity score, acute renal failure, recent infections or high-risk antibiotic use, hemodialysis in the last month, race, and measures of recent healthcare utilization. The final algorithm resulted in an AUC of 0.69 and a PPV of 3.4%. Conclusions: We developed a predictive algorithm to identify a patient population with increased risk of CDI over the next 2-12 months. Our algorithm can be used prospectively with clinical and administrative data to facilitate the feasibility of conducting efficacy studies in a timely manner in an appropriate population.

However, a comprehensive understanding of epidemiology of COVID-19 infection in young children under five years, the most at-risk age-group for respiratory infections, remain unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in children under five years. Method: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses, we searched several electronic databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus) with no language restriction for published epidemiological studies and case-reports reporting laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in children under five years until June 4, 2020. We assessed pooled prevalence for key demographics and clinical characteristics using Freeman-Tukey double arcsine random-effects model for studies except case-reports. We evaluated risk of bias separately for case-reports and other studies. Results: We identified 1,964 articles, of which, 65 articles were eligible for systematic review that represented 1,214 children younger than five years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. The pooled estimates showed that 50% young COVID-19 cases were infants (95% CI: 36% - 63%, 27 studies); 53% were male (95% CI: 41% - 65%, 24 studies); 43% were asymptomatic (95% CI: 15% - 73%, 9 studies) and 7% (95% CI: 0% - 30%, 5 studies) had severe disease that required intensive-care-unit admission. Of 139 newborns from COVID-19 infected mothers, five (3.6%) were COVID-19 positive. There was only one death recorded. Discussion: This systematic review reports the largest number of children younger than five years with COVID-19 infection till date. Our meta-analysis shows nearly half of young COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic and half were infants, highlighting the need for ongoing surveillance to better understand the epidemiology, clinical pattern, and transmission of COVID-19 to develop effective preventive strategies against COVID-19 disease in young paediatric population.

Glycoconjugate vaccines containing the C. jejuni N-glycan have been reported to be partially protective in chickens. However, our previous studies with subunit vaccines comprising the C. jejuni FlpA or SodB proteins with up to two or three C. jejuni N-glycans, respectively, failed to elicit significant protection. In this study, protein glycan coupling technology was used to add up to ten C. jejuni N-glycans onto a detoxified form of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ExoA). The glycoprotein, G-ExoA, was evaluated for efficacy against intestinal colonisation of White Leghorn chickens by C. jejuni strains M1 and 11168H relative to unglycosylated ExoA. Chickens were challenged with the minimum dose required for reliable colonisation, which was 102 colony-forming units (CFU) for strain M1 and and 104 CFU for strain 11168H. Vaccine-specific serum IgY was detected in chickens vaccinated with both ExoA and G-ExoA. However, no reduction in caecal colonisation by C. jejuni was observed. While the glycan dose achieved with G-ExoA was higher than FlpA- or SodB-based glycoconjugates that were previously evaluated, it was lower than that of glycoconjugates where protection against C. jejuni has been reported, indicating that protection may be highly sensitive to the amount of glycan presented and/or study-specific variables.

A safe, effective, and affordable vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infections/diseases is urgently needed. We have been developing a recombinant vaccine based on a prefusion-stabilized spike trimer of SARS-CoV-2 and formulated with aluminium hydroxide and CpG 7909. The spike protein was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, purified, and prepared as a stable formulation with the dual adjuvant. Immunogenicity studies showed that candidate vaccines elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses and substantial CD4+ T cell responses in both mice and non-human primates. And vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies persisted at high level for at least 6 months. Challenge studies demonstrated that candidate vaccine reduced the viral loads and inflammation in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected golden Syrian hamsters significantly. In addition, the vaccine-induced antibodies showed cross-neutralization activity against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants.

The disease can cause up to 140,000 deaths annually. Internal displacement during supplemental immunization activities often affects optimal reach and coverage of the campaign as people move and implementation and logistic plans are usually disrupted with attendant missed children. This study documented the process of extension of the measles vaccination campaign (MVC) 2018 for five internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Benue state, not previously in the microplan, to increase population herd immunity. Methods: We obtained population figures and disease surveillance data for five IDPs camps and used it to conduct detailed microplanning to determine the requirement for the conduct of additional days of measles vaccination. Vaccination teams used fixed posts in the camps and temporary posts strategy in designated locations in the host communities. Results: The estimated total population of the IDPs was 170,000 with MVC target population of 9374 which was not earlier planned for. There was reported measles outbreaks in IDP camps in both Guma and Makurdi Local Government areas (LGAs) during period of displacement. Microplans requirement determined 10,421 bundled measles vaccine, 30 health workers, 5 vehicles and 15 motorcycles. A total of 7679 out of 9374 (81.9%) of the eligible children aged 9-59 months were vaccinated during the 3 days of the campaign. Conclusion: Non-inclusion of plans on internally displaced population in supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) microplans have a potential risk of vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) outbreak. Future Measles Vaccination campaigns should take cognizance of internal displacement due to insecurity and other humanitarian emergencies. (C) 2021 World Health Organization.

J	Jacobi, CJ; Vaidyanathan, B				Jacobi, Christopher Justin; Vaidyanathan, Brandon			Racial differences in anticipated COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among religious populations in the US	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Vaccine acceptance; Vaccine hesitancy; Racial minorities; Religion; Health disparities		Given high COVID-19 infection and mortality rates among racial minorities in the US and their higher rates of religiosity, it is important to examine how the intersection of race and religion influences perceptions of COVID-19 vaccinations. Data for this study come from online surveys conducted in twelve congregations between October and December 2020 (N = 1,609). Based on logistic regression analyses, this study demonstrates a severe disparity of 24 percentage points (95% confidence interval 0.14-0.33) in anticipated COVID-19 vaccine acceptance between African Americans and White Americans, even when controlling for trust in COVID-19 information from scientists and levels of worrying about COVID-19 as well as religiosity and demographic factors. Religiosity is negatively associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across racial groups. The findings suggest that the intersection of race and religion should be considered when designing immunization programs, for instance by fostering collaborations and dialogue with faith leaders of racial minority congregations.

We developed a dynamic compartment model to simulate costs and health outcomes for 12 years for four OCVs deployment scenarios: (1) vaccination of children aged one and above with two doses of OCVs, (2) vaccination of population aged 5 and above with a single dose of OCVs, (3) vaccination of children aged 1-4 with two doses of OCVs; and (4) combined strategy of (2) and (3). We obtained all parameters from the literature and performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from both health systems and societal perspectives, in comparison with the base scenario of no vaccination. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the four strategies from the societal perspective were $2,236, $2,250, $1,109, and $2,112 per DALY averted, respectively, with herd immunity being considered. Without herd immunity, the ICERs increased substantially for all four scenarios except for the scenario that vaccinates children aged 1-4 only. The major determinants of ICERs were the case fatality rate and the incidence of cholera, as well as the efficacy of OCVs. The projection period and frequency of administering OCVs would also affect the cost-effectiveness of OCVs. With the cut-off of 1.5 times gross domestic product per capita, the four OCVs deployment strategies are cost-effective. The combined strategy is more efficient than the strategy of vaccinating the population aged one and above with two doses of OCVs and could be considered in the resource-limited settings.

Method: A prospective cohort observational study was performed including 200 frail elderly subjects suf-fering RUTI, both females and males, between 2016 and 2018. The effectiveness of autovaccines and the polybacterial formulation MV140 (Uromune (R)), consisting of whole-cell heat-inactivated Escherichia coli 25%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 25%, Proteus vulgaris 25% and Enterococcus faecalis 25% were evaluated. Subjects initiated a 3-month sublingually daily course with MV140 or autovaccine, either first treatment or a new course if they had been previously vaccinated prior to inclusion in the study. Number of UTIs and quality of life (QoL, SF-36 score) were measured in the different study groups. Results: The mean age for participants was 82.67 (SD, 7.12) for female and 80.23 (SD, 11.12) for male sub-jects. In all groups, 12 months following bacterial immunotherapy, the number of UTIs significantly decreased compared to before the treatment with autovaccine or MV140: the rate of reduction ranged between 7-and 40-fold. An increase in QoL scoring was also observed in any study group. When comparing medical interventions, MV140 conferred significantly higher benefit than autovaccines. For previously vaccinated individuals, a new 3-month course with MV140 or autovaccines provided further clinical improvement. Conclusions: MV140 and autovaccines emerge as valuable immunoprophylaxis for the management of RUTI in the frail elderly, contributing to an improvement in patient's quality of life. Herein, MV140 has shown to confer a higher effectiveness compared to autovaccines, regardless sex or course of treatment. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Still, various countries have reported high vaccine hesitancy rates. It is important to know the vaccine hesitancy profile in Brazil to help design adequate communi-cation strategies. Methods: A voluntary, anonymous online survey was conducted from January 22 to 29, 2021, including resident Brazilian adults to assess factors related to vaccine hesitancy. Sociodemographic and epidemio-logical data were analyzed. A bivariate analysis was conducted with the independent variables, with vac-cine hesitancy as the outcome variable, and a multivariate logistic model was used to calculated adjusted odds ratios. Results: The sample included 173,178 respondents, and vaccine hesitancy was found in 10.5%. The prin-cipal factors associated with vaccine hesitancy were the following: assigning importance to the vaccines efficacy (AOR = 16.39), fear of adverse reactions (AOR = 11.23), and assigning importance to the vaccines country of origin (AOR = 3.72). Other risk factors were the following: male gender (AOR = 1.62), having children (AOR = 1.29), 9 years of schooling or less (AOR = 1.31), living in the Central-West region (AOR = 1.19), age > 40 years (AOR = 1.17), and monthly income < U$788.68 (AOR = 1.13). The two vac-cines available in Brazil, Covishield and CoronaVac, showed similar confidence, 80.13% and 76.36%, respectively, despite the higher rejection of the latter vaccines Chinese origin. Interpretation: This online survey confirms the low vaccine hesitancy rate among Brazilians and allowed the identification of a profile that can assist the elaboration of communication strategies to increase vac-cine adherence.

We conducted a single center prospective study to identify the clinical and immunological features asso-ciated with vaccine-induced antibody response in 53 participants before and after COVID-19 mRNA vac-cination. This is the first report on the anti-spike RBD and anti-nucleocapsid antibody response, along with pre-and post-vaccine absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) and flow cytometry analysis of CD19 and CD20 lymphocytes in patients with MS and NMO. We tested the hypothesis that patients on BCDT may have impaired COVID-19 vaccine humoral responses. Among patients on BCDT, 36.4% demonstrated a positive antibody response to spike RBD, in comparison to 100% in all other groups such as healthy con-trols, untreated MS, and patients on non-B cell depleting DMTs (p < 0.0001). Immunological data revealed lower baseline (pre-vaccination) levels of IgM in patients on BCDT (p = 0.003). Low CD19 and CD20 counts and a shorter interval from the last B cell depleting therapy infusion to the first vaccine dose were asso-ciated with a negative spike RBD antibody response (non-seroconverter) in patients on BCDT. Age, body mass index (BMI) and total treatment duration did not differ between seroconverters and non-seroconverters. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: We performed a validation study as part of a retrospective cohort study of adult HZ patients hospitalized at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke during 2000-2017. Cases were identified using ICD codes from an inpatient administrative database. HZ cases identified by ICD-9 (053.xx) and ICD-10 (B02.x) codes were chart-confirmed, and performance characteristics of ICD code algorithms were calculated (positive predictive value [PPV] and sensitivity). Results: Overall, 1314 hospitalizations with HZ diagnosis (HZh) with or without complications were identified during 2000-2017. Among the hospitalizations, 526 (44.4%) were due to active HZ disease or a complication related to a recent or previous HZ episode. These hospitalizations were due to active disease at the time of admission (340/526, 64.6%), HZ that developed during hospitalization (120/526, 22.8%), or a complication directly related to a recent or previous HZ episode (66/526, 12.6%). PPV was significantly higher when HZ was the primary diagnosis (276/310, 89%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 85-92%) than when HZ was a secondary diagnosis (254/928, 27%, 95% CI: 25-30%) (p < 0.0001), and the PPV of a first secondary diagnosis (84/140, 60.0%, 95% CI: 51.3-68.2%) was higher than that of other secondary diagnoses (203/794, 25.6%, 95% CI: 22.6-28.8%) (p < 0.0001). An algorithm combining ICD codes and antiviral usage demonstrated the best sensitivity (86.3%, 95% CI: 83.1-89.1%) and PPV to identify HZh (100%, 95% CI: 99.2-100%). Poisson regression revealed no significant changes in HZh over time (incidence rate ratio: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.92-1.04%; p = 0.5). Conclusion: HZh incidence was stable over time. Prescription of antivirals might be a useful addition to ICD codes to identify HZh cases from administrative databases. Crown Copyright (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Paratyphi, is a cause of high morbidity and mortality among children in South Asia. Rising antimicrobial resistance presents an additional challenge. Typhoid Conjugate Vaccines (TCV) are recommended by the World Health Organization for use among people 6 months to 45 years old living in endemic settings. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of TCV against culture-confirmed S. Typhi in Lyari Town, Karachi, Pakistan. This peri-urban town was one of the worst affected by the outbreak of extensively drug resistant (XDR) typhoid that started in November 2016. Methods: A matched case-control study was conducted following a mass immunization campaign with TCV at three key hospitals in Lyari Town Karachi, Pakistan. Children aged 6 months to 15 years presenting with culture-confirmed S. Typhi were enrolled as cases. For each case, at least 1 age-matched hospital control and two age-matched community controls were enrolled. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confi-dence intervals (CIs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression. Results: Of 82 typhoid fever patients enrolled from August 2019 through December 2019, 8 (9.8%) had received vaccine for typhoid. Of the 164 community controls and 82 hospital controls enrolled, 38 (23.2%) community controls and 27 (32.9%) hospital controls were vaccinated for typhoid. The age and sex-adjusted vaccine effectiveness was found to be 72% (95% CI: 34% -88%). The consumption of meals prepared outside home more than once per month (adjusted odds ratio: 3.72, 95% CI: 1.55-8.94; p-value: 0.003) was associated with the development of culture-confirmed typhoid. Conclusion: A single dose of TCV is effective against culture confirmed typhoid among children aged 6 months to 15 years old in an XDR typhoid outbreak setting of a peri-urban community in Karachi, Pakistan.

Safety of components and platforms of COVID-19 vaccines considered for use in pregnancy: A rapid review	VACCINE			English	Review						Pregnancy; COVID-19; Vaccine safety; Adjuvant; Systematic review	SWINE FLU VACCINATION; MATERNAL INFLUENZA VACCINATION; H1N1 INFLUENZA; BIRTH OUTCOMES; HEPATITIS-B; FETAL-DEATH; COHORT; RISK; SURVEILLANCE; A(H1N1)V2009	Background: Rapid assessment of COVID-19 vaccine safety during pregnancy is urgently needed. Methods: We conducted a rapid systematic review, to evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccines selected by the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access-Maternal Immunization Working Group in August 2020, including their components and their technological platforms used in other vaccines for pregnant persons. We searched literature databases, COVID-19 vaccine pregnancy registries, and explored reference lists from the inception date to February 2021 without language restriction. Pairs of reviewers independently selected studies through COVIDENCE, and performed the data extraction and the risk of bias assessment. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021234185). Results: We retrieved 6757 records and 12 COVID-19 pregnancy registries from the search strategy; 38 clinical and non-clinical studies (involving 2,398,855 pregnant persons and 56 pregnant animals) were included. Most studies (89%) were conducted in high-income countries and were cohort studies (57%). Most studies (76%) compared vaccine exposures with no exposure during the three trimesters of pregnancy. The most frequent exposure was to AS03 adjuvant, in the context of A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccines, (n = 24) and aluminum-based adjuvants (n = 11). Only one study reported exposure to messenger RNA in lipid nanoparticles COVID-19 vaccines. Except for one preliminary report about A/H1N1 influenza vaccination (adjuvant AS03), corrected by the authors in a more thorough analysis, all studies concluded that there were no safety concerns. Conclusion: This rapid review found no evidence of pregnancy-associated safety concerns of COVID-19 vaccines or of their components or platforms when used in other vaccines. However, the need for further data on several vaccine platforms and components is warranted, given their novelty. Our findings support current WHO guidelines recommending that pregnant persons may consider receiving COVID-19 vacci-nes, particularly if they are at high risk of exposure or have comorbidities that enhance the risk of severe disease.

VACCINE			English	Article						Measles; Immunity; Italy; Epidemiology		In Italy, the inclusion of measles vaccine in children immunization schedule and the promotion of national mass vaccination campaigns increased measles vaccination coverage. However, measles outbreaks continue to occur increasingly involving adolescents and adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence to measles antibody in a sample of Italian population between 1993 and 2018. Human serum samples from subjects aged 3-40 years were collected between 1993 and 2018 and tested for measles IgG antibodies by commercial ELISA. During the study period, the 3-10-year-old age group showed the most important change, with a significant increase in 2003-2007 in both seroprevalence and IgG levels, followed by a slow decrease. The 11-18-year-old age group showed relatively stable seroprevalence rates and IgG levels over the years. The 19-30-year-old group showed stable seroprevalence rates, albeit with a decrease in IgG levels. After a significant increase in 1999-2002, the 31-40-year-old age group had high seroprevalence rates and IgG levels. Despite efforts at national level for implementing measles vaccination, a large proportion of the population is still susceptible to measles. Even if vaccination coverage increases enough to achieve the level of immunization required for herd immunity in new birth cohorts, outbreaks will continue to occur if there are immunity gaps in older age groups. Establishing policies for measles vaccination targeting adult population is needed to close immunity gaps and reach the elimination goal. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Okamura, S; Ebina, H				Okamura, Shinya; Ebina, Hirotaka			Could live attenuated vaccines better control COVID-19?	VACCINE			English	Review						COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Live attenuated vaccine; Vaccine	ADENOVIRUS VECTORS; UNITED-STATES; INFLUENZA VACCINE; SARS-COV-2; VIRUS; IMMUNITY; E1; EMERGENCE; INFECTION; STRAINS	In an effort to control the COVID-19 pandemic, large-scale vaccination is being implemented in various countries using anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on mRNAs, adenovirus vectors, and inactivated viruses. However, there are concerns regarding adverse effects, such as the induction of fever attributed to mRNA vaccines and pre-existing immunity against adenovirus vectored vaccines or their possible involvement in the development of thrombosis. The induction of antibodies against the adenovirus vector itself constitutes another hindrance, rendering boosting vaccinations ineffective. Additionally, it has been questioned whether inactivated vaccines that predominantly induce humoral immunity are effective against newly arising variants, as some isolated strains were found to be resistant to the serum from COVID-19-recovered patients. Although the number of vaccinated people is steadily increasing on a global scale, it is still necessary to develop vaccines to address the difficulties and concerns mentioned above. Among the various vaccine modalities, live attenuated vaccines have been considered the most effective, since they closely replicate a natural infection without the burden of the disease. In our attempt to provide an additional option to the repertoire of COVID-19 vaccines, we succeeded in isolating temperature-sensitive strains with unique phenotypes that could serve as seeds for a live attenuated vaccine. In this review article, we summarize the characteristics of the currently approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, we focus on the novel temperature sensitive variants of SARS-CoV-2 that we have recently isolated, and their potential application as live attenuated vaccines. Based on a thorough evaluation of the different vaccine modalities, we argue that it is important to optimize usage not only based on efficacy, but also on the phases of the pandemic. Our findings can be used to inform vaccination practices and improve global recovery from the COVID19 pandemic. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in these two regions, symptoms associated with infection and factors associated with antibody concentrations. Methods: Participants were selected using stratified (formed by age decades) random sampling and recruited by general practitioners. IgG or neutralizing antibodies were determined from sera by four assays. Symptoms associated with seropositivity were analyzed by multiple correspondence analysis, antibody concentrations by multiple linear regression. Results: Total of 3608 individual were invited and 1960 recruited from May 8 to July 31, 2020. Seroprevalence was 1.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-2.5) and 6.3% (95% CI 5.0-7.9), infection fatality rate 0.1% (95% CI 0.0-0.2) and 1.3% (95% CI 0.4-2.1) in Tallinn and Saaremaa, respectively. Of seropositive subjects 19.2% (14/73) had acute respiratory illness. Fever, diarrhea and the absence of cough and runny nose were associated with seropositivity in individuals aged 50 or more years. IgG, but not neutralizing antibodies concentrations were higher if fever, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, chest pain or diarrhea was present, or hospitalization required. Conclusion: Similarly to other European countries the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Estonia was low even in the hotspot region Saaremaa suggesting that majority of population is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Focusing only on respiratory symptoms may delay accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Increases in HPV-16/18 antibody avidity and HPV-specific memory B-cell response in mid-adult aged men post-dose three of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine	VACCINE			English	Article							IMMUNE-RESPONSES; INFLUENZA VACCINE; EFFICACY; L1; IMMUNOGENICITY; PROTECTION; INFECTION; SAFETY; WOMEN	Strong quantitative and functional antibody responses to the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine were reported in mid-adult aged men, but there are limited data on the avidity of the antibody response and the memory B-cell response following vaccination. Although circulating antibodies induced by vaccination are believed to be the main mediators of protection against infection, evaluation of avidity of antibodies and memory B cell responses are critical for a better understanding of the vaccine immunogenicity mechanisms. Both the modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the enzyme linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay are tools to measure the humoral and cellular immune responses post vaccination to characterize vaccine immunogenicity. The avidity of HPV-16 and HPV-18 specific IgG in the serum of mid-adult aged men (N = 126) who received three quadrivalent HPV vaccine doses was examined using a modified ELISA. HPV-16 memory B-cell responses were assessed via ELISpot at month 0 (prior to vaccination) and 1-month post-dose three of the vaccine (month 7). The quadrivalent vaccine induced an increase in HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody avidity at month 7. HPV-18 avidity levels moderately correlated with anti-HPV-18 antibody titers, but no association was observed for HPV-16 antibody titers and avidity levels. The HPV-16-specific memory B-cell response was induced following three vaccine doses, however, no association with anti-HPV-16 antibody avidity was observed. Three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine increased antibody affinity maturation for HPV-16/18 and increased the frequency of anti-HPV-16 memory B-cells in mid-adult aged men. (C) 2021 The Authors.

While no licensed vaccine exists, maternal immunization might protect against neonatal disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a prototype vaccine consisting of the fused N-terminal domains of the AlphaC and Rib surface proteins of GBS (GBS-NN). Methods: GBS-NN was tested in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, phase I study, in healthy non-pregnant women. A dose-escalation phase, with two doses, four weeks apart, of 10, 50 or 250 mg, administered with or without aluminium hydroxide, was initially assessed (n = 60). This was followed by a dose-confirmation study, where one dose of 100 mg adjuvanted GBS-NN was compared with two doses of either 50 or 100 mg adjuvanted GBS-NN, again administered with four weeks interval between the doses (n = 180). Safety and immunogenicity were monitored for one year. Results: GBS-NN was well tolerated with some, mostly mild, injection site reactions observed. Adjuvant significantly increased antibody concentrations and the response was boosted by a second dose. The IgG GMCs remained strongly elevated during the whole one-year duration of the study. Maximal responses occurred after two 50 mg doses, resulting in IgG GMC of 16.9 mg/ml at the primary immunological endpoint, twelve weeks after the first dose. For this regimen, 100% and 89% of the subjects achieved antibody levels above the arbitrary thresholds of 1 and 4 mg/ml, respectively. The added beneficial effect of a second dose was most pronounced for subjects with pre-existing IgG levels below the median of the entire cohort. Conclusion: The prototype GBS-NN vaccine was found to be well tolerated and highly immunogenic with an optimal regimen of two doses of 50 mg in the presence of adjuvant. Further development of a maternal vaccine based on the N-terminal domains of the alpha-like protein family of GBS is warranted. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been available since 2006. Several Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries have since introduced and/or piloted the HPV vaccine with adolescent females. This systematic review was conducted to understand what factors influence parents' acceptance of the HPV vaccine in the region. Methods: Seven databases were searched for qualitative and quantitative studies published up to 16 April 2020. Papers were included if they were peer-reviewed, in English, available in full text, and had a focus on parents' knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and acceptance of the HPV vaccine. Findings were integrated to answer the review question using framework analysis based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Results: Sixteen publications were included and synthesised under the Theory of Planned Behaviour domains: 1) Knowledge, attitudes and acceptance, 2) subjective norms, and 3) perceived behavioural control. Parents' attitudes to HPV vaccination were positive and acceptance to vaccinate their daughters against HPV was high. The uptake was high when the vaccine was offered for free. Conclusion: Parents' acceptance and uptake of the HPV vaccine in ASEAN member-countries was high when the vaccine was offered for free even though their knowledge of cervical cancer and HPV was poor. Further research is needed to see how uptake and acceptance can be maintain when the vaccine is not offered for free. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4(+) and CD8 (+) T cell responses using MHC class I and II tetramers	VACCINE			English	Article						SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine; MHC; Peptide; QuickSwitch; Peptide exchange		The success of SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) vaccines is measured by their ability to mount immune memory responses that are long-lasting. To achieve this goal, it is important to identify surrogates of immune protection, namely, CoV-2 MHC Class I and II immunodominant pieces/epitopes and methodologies to measure them. Here, we present results of flow cytometry-based MHC Class I and II QuickSwitchTM platforms for assessing SARS-CoV-2 peptide binding affinities to various human alleles as well as the H-2 Kb mouse allele. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 potential MHC binders were screened and validated by QuickSwitch testing. The screen included 31 MHC Class I and 19 MHC Class II peptides predicted to be good binders by the IEDB web resource provided by NIAID. While several predicted peptides with acceptable theoretical Kd showed poor MHC occupancies, fourteen MHC class II and three MHC class I peptides showed promiscuity in that they bind to multiple MHC molecule types. In addition to providing important data towards the study of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its presented antigenic epitopes, the peptides identified in this study can be used in the QuickSwitch platform to generate MHC tetramers. With those tetramers, scientists can assess CD4 + and CD8 + immune responses to these different MHC/peptide complexes. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Booster immunization is required in order to induce long-lived tetanus-toxoid (TT) specific antibody response. We investigated the prevalence and risk factors of TT seronegativity in a cohort of people living with HIV (PWH) in Belgium along with the respective performance of vaccine history and a rapid dipstick test (Tetanus Quick Stick (R) or TQS) compared to ELISA testing. Methods: PWH were prospectively enrolled and answered a questionnaire. ELISA was performed on serum or plasma using a commercial kit. A TT antibody level >= 0.15 IU / mL was considered protective. The TQS test was performed on a limited number of subjects. Results: Three-hundred forty-four subjects were included. The prevalence of tetanus seroprotection was 84,9%. Median age was 46.7 and 68% were born outside Belgium. Antiretroviral therapy coverage was almost universal (98.5%). After multivariable analysis, two risk factors were independently associated with TT seronegativity: an education level equivalent or below than secondary school and being born outside Europe. Vaccine history was shown to be unreliable (sensitivity: 43.8%; specificity: 76.5%; positive predictive value: 91.4% and negative predictive value :19.3%). The correlation between vaccine history and tetanus seroprotection was low (kappa coefficient = 0.09). The TQS performances were good (sensitivity 86.4%, specificity 96.0%, positive predictive value 99.3%, negative predictive value 52.17%). The correlation between TQS and tetanus seroprotection was substantial (kappa coefficient = 0.61). Conclusions: In this cohort of PWH with a high proportion of migrants, socio-demographic and educational factors were associated with TT seronegativity while HIV-related factors were not, indicating that vaccine information should be tailored to cultural and educational background. As vaccine history is not reliable, TQS could represent an efficient tool for screening of TT-seronegativity. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While the attributable risk and clinical severity of first febrile VPS is well known, the risk and clinical outcomes of VPS recurrence is less well defined. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of revaccination management and outcomes in children who experienced a VPS as their first seizure seen in Australian Specialist Immunisation Clinics between 2013 and 2017. Vaccination outcomes were compared between children who had a VPS as their only seizure (VPS only) and children who had further non-vaccine proximate seizures following their initial VPS (VPS+) prior to review at the clinic. Results: We identified 119 children with a VPS as their first seizure, of which 61 (51%) went on to have other seizures (VPS+). Children with VPS+ were more likely to present at a younger age (6.2 vs 12.5 months, P = 0.03), with afebrile seizures (42.6% vs 15.5%, P = 0.002) compared to VPS only children. VPS recurrence on revaccination was uncommon in both groups, but more common in VPS+ children (12.5% vs 2.4%, P = 0.07). Having an epilepsy diagnosis, specifically Dravet syndrome, was associated with VPS recurrence (P < 0.001). Of the four children with Dravet syndrome who had VPS recurrence, all had status epilepticus following revaccination. Conclusion: In children who presented with a single VPS as their only seizure, VPS recurrence on revaccination was uncommon. Children who had multiple non-vaccine proximate seizures following their initial VPS (VPS+) were more likely to present with afebrile VPS, at a younger age and have a VPS recurrence with vaccination. In these children, particularly those aged < 12 months, assessment and investigation for diagnosis of Dravet syndrome should be considered and additional precautions for revaccination undertaken as they are at highest risk of VPS recurrence.

J	Vulpe, SN; Rughinis, C				Vulpe, Simona-Nicoleta; Rughinis, Cosima			Social amplification of risk and "probable vaccine damage": A typology of vaccination beliefs in 28 European countries	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine hesitancy; Vaccine damage; Typology; Eurobarometer; Belief configurations		Background: Despite lacking scientific support, vaccine hesitancy is widespread. While serious vaccine damage as a scientific fact is real yet statistically highly uncommon, emerging social and technological forces have amplified perceptions of risk for "probable vaccine damage", making it a widely shared inter-subjective reality. Methods: Using the Eurobarometer 91.2 survey on a statistically representative EU27-UK sample inter-viewed in March 2019, we documented perceptions of vaccine risks and identified three belief configurations regarding vaccine effectiveness, safety, and usefulness, through exploratory cluster analysis. Results: The public beliefs in significant vaccine risks are frequent. Approximatively one-tenth of the EU27-UK population consider that vaccines are not rigorously tested before authorization, one-third believe that vaccines can overload or weaken the immune system and that they can cause the disease against which they protect, and almost one-half believe that vaccines can cause serious side effects. We identified three belief configurations: hesitant, confident, and trade-off clusters. The hesitant type (approx. 11% of EU27-UK respondents) is defined by the perception that vaccines are rather ineffective, affected by risks of probable vaccine damage, not well-tested, and useless; the confident type (approx. 59%) is defined by beliefs that vaccines are effective, safe, well-tested, and useful; and the trade-off type (approx. 29%) combines beliefs that vaccines are effective, well-tested and useful, with perceptions of probable vaccine damage. The vaccine-confident and the trade-off types have similar vaccination histories, indicating the significant role of other factors besides beliefs in inducing behavior. Conclusions: The high proportion of varying public beliefs in significant vaccine risks and the presence of a trade-off type of vaccination assessment indicate the social normality of beliefs in probable vaccine damage. Communication campaigns should take into account the social normality of the perceived risk of "probable vaccine damage" across various social types, and patterns of concomitant trust and mistrust in vaccination.

Immune response to the hepatitis B vaccine among HIV-infected adults in Uganda	VACCINE			English	Article						Immune response; Hepatitis B vaccine; HIV seropositive adults; Sub-Saharan Africa		Background: Co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is common in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and can rapidly progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent data demonstrate ongoing HBV transmission among HIV-infected adults in SSA, suggesting that complications of HIV/HBV co-infection could be prevented with HBV vaccination. Because HBV vaccine efficacy is poorly understood among HIV-infected persons in SSA, we sought to characterize the humoral response to the HBV vaccine in HIV-seropositive Ugandan adults. Methods: We enrolled HIV-infected adults in Kampala, Uganda without serologic evidence of prior HBV infection. Three HBV vaccine doses were administered at 0, 1 and 6 months. Anti-HBs levels were measured 4 weeks after the third vaccine dose. "Response" to vaccination was defined as anti-HBs levels >= 10 IU/L and "high response" as >= 100 IU/L. Regression analysis was used to determine predictors of response. Results: Of 251 HIV-positive adults screened, 132 (53%) had no prior HBV infection or immunity and were enrolled. Most participants were women [89 (67%)]; median (IQR) age was 32 years (27-41), and 68 (52%) had received antiretroviral therapy (ART) for > 3 months. Median (IQR) CD4 count was 426 (261-583), and 64 (94%) of the 68 receiving ART had undetectable plasma HIV RNA. Overall, 117 (92%) participants seroconverted to the vaccine (anti-HBs >= 10 IU/L), with 109 (86%) participants having high-level response (anti-HBs >= 100 IU/L). In multivariate analysis, only baseline CD4 > 200 cells/mm3 was associated with response [OR = 6.97 (1.34-34.71), p = 0.02] and high-level response [OR = 4.25 (1.15-15.69)], p = 0.03]. Conclusion: HBV vaccination was effective in eliciting a protective humoral response, particularly among those with higher CD4 counts. Half of the screened patients did not have immunity to HBV infection, suggesting a large at-risk population for HBV infection among HIV-positive adults in Uganda. Our findings support including HBV vaccination as part of routine care among HIV-positive adults. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We estimated the cost due to influenza illness among children < 5-year-old in Suzhou, China. Methods: This study adopted a societal perspective to estimate direct medical cost, direct non-medical cost, and indirect cost related to lost productivity. Data to calculate costs and rates of three influenza illness outcomes (non-medically attended, outpatient and hospitalization) were collected from prospective community-based cohort studies and hospital-based enhanced laboratory-confirmed influenza surveillance in Suzhou during the 2011/12 to 2016/17 influenza seasons. We used mean cost-per-episode, annual incidence rates of episodes of each outcome, and annual population size to estimate the total annual economic burden of influenza illnesses among children < 5-year-old for Suzhou. All costs were reported in 2017 U.S. dollars. Results: The mean cost-per-episode (standard deviation) was $9.92 (13.26) for non-medically attended influenza, $161.05 (176.98) for influenza outpatient illnesses, and $1425.95 (603.59) for influenza hospitalizations. By applying the annual incidence rates to the population size, we estimated an annual total of 4,919 episodes of non-medically attended influenza, 21,994 influenza outpatient, and 2,633 influenza hospitalization. Total annual economic burden of influenza to society among children < 5-year-old in Suzhou was $7.37 (95% confidence interval, 6.9-7.8) million, with estimated costs for non-medically attended influenza of $49,000 (46,000-52,000), influenza outpatients $3.5 (3.3-3.8) million, and influenza hospitalizations $3.8 (3.6-3.9) million. Among outpatients, the indirect cost was 36.3% ($1.3 million) of total economic burden, accounting for 21,994 days of lost productivity annually. Among inpatients, the indirect cost was 22.1% ($829,000), accounting for 18,431 days of lost productivity annually. Conclusions: Our findings show that influenza in children < 5-year-oldcauses substantial societal economic burden in Suzhou, China. Assessing the potential economic benefit of increasing influenza vaccination coverage in this population is warranted. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VACCINE			English	Article						Ethics; Pandemic vaccine; Pandemic infection; SARS-CoV-2; Values; Pandemic vaccination strategies		Vaccination plays an important role in pandemic planning and response. The possibility of developing an effective vaccine for a novel pandemic virus is not assured. However, as we have seen with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, with sufficient resources and global focus, successful outcomes can be achieved in a relatively short period. However even when vaccine is available it will initially be scarce. When one becomes available, how should it be distributed? In this paper we explicate how ethical thinking that is carefully attuned to context is essential to decisions about how we should conduct vaccination in a pandemic where demand exceeds supply. We focus on two key issues. First, setting the aims for a pandemic vaccination programme. Second, thinking about the means of delivering a chosen aim. We outline how pandemic vaccine distribution strategies can be implemented with distinct aims, e.g. protecting groups at greater risk of harm, saving the most lives, or ensuring societal benefit. Each aim will result in a focus on a different priority population and each strategy will have a different benefit-harm profile. Once we have decided our aim, we still have choices to make about delivery. We may achieve at least some ends via direct or indirect strategies. Such policy decisions are not merely technical, but necessarily involve ethics. One important general issue is that such planning decisions about distribution will always be made under conditions of uncertainty about vaccine safety and effectiveness. However, planning how to distribute vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is even harder because we understand relatively little about the virus, transmission, and its immunological impact in the short and long term.

Series completion is associated with increased vaccine effectiveness and longevity of protection. Medicaid beneficiaries are among populations with higher HPV vaccine uptake; however, little research describes factors that influence their HPV vaccine series completion. This study reports on a secondary data analysis of Arizona Medicaid data (Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System) from years 2008-2016. We summarized patient data using descriptive statistics and explored relationships between demographic variables and HPV vaccine administration information using bivariate logistic regression. Results of this analysis showed that females were more likely to complete the series as compared to males, and the age group that had the greatest odd of vaccine completion were 13-17-year-olds, the catch-up vaccine population. White Medicaid beneficiaries were most likely to adhere to HPV vaccine guidelines, followed by Hispanic beneficiaries. Patients receiving care in urban settings were more likely to complete the HPV vaccine series than people receiving care in rural areas of the state. Although statistically insignificant, people living with HIV were less likely to complete the 3-dose series. Future work should focus on ensuring that HPV vaccine age-eligible Medicaid, including people living with HIV, adhere to HPV vaccine guidelines. Expanding programs such as Vaccines for Children and scope of practice for dental professionals to offer the vaccine may provide additional options for Medicaid beneficiaries to vaccinate.

From bad to worse II: Risk amplification of the HPV vaccine on Facebook	VACCINE			English	Article						Facebook; Social media; HPV vaccine; Vaccine hesitance; Risk; Health communication	SOCIAL AMPLIFICATION; INFORMATION; MEDIA; COVERAGE; DEBATE	Background: The HPV vaccine is seen by many audiences as a health risk, but this perspective has seen little analysis. This study is the continuation of an analysis of the first decade of public, HPV-vaccine related Facebook posts. For this study, social amplification of risk framework concepts were analyzed to measure their relationships with post characteristics, engagement, and to see how those variables changed over time. Methods: There were 6,506 public HPV vaccine-related Facebook posts (n = 6,506) within the first ten years after HPV vaccine's FDA approval (June 8, 2006 - June 8, 2016). Post characteristics, engagement, and social amplification of risk framework messages were coded (Krippendorf's alpha range: 0.67-1.00). Results: HPV vaccine risk amplification messages appeared in 39.5% of posts (n = 2,568), attenuated in 2.9% of post (n = 186), with the remaining 57.7% (n = 3,752) doing neither. Compared to groups, individuals were over-represented in authoring HPV vaccine risk amplifying messages. Hyperlinks and negative tone towards the HPV vaccine. HPV vaccine risk amplifying messages also received significantly greater reaction (r = 0.050, p < 0.0001), comment (r = 0.030, p < 0.0001), and share counts (r = 0.028, p < 0.0001). The data showed evidence of forward momentum (Durbin-Watson values) of HPV vaccine risk amplification (0.006), related ripples (0.530), and impacts (1.376). Conclusion: Nearly four out of every ten Facebook posts about the HPV vaccine contained messages that amplified the risk of HPV vaccine and the data suggest that these posts had momentum over time. Research must continue to address the perception of vaccine safety where the vaccine is perceived as the health threat, with deep research into online communities to discover the perceived ripples and impacts.

However, many children living in low- and- middle income countries do not get adequate immunization due to several factors. Mobile phone reminder interventions have shown great potential in enhancing a number of immunization outcomes. However, the evidence supporting its use in these countries is vague. This systematic review was conducted to provide evidence for mobile phone reminder in enhancing immunization uptake, completeness and timeliness. This review was conducted in accordance to the PRISMA recommendations. Three online databases; PubMed, Cochrane Library and African Journals Online, were systematically searched for potentially relevant studies. Screening of records (titles/abstracts from and full-texts) was done using Covidence. Meta-analyses were conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager (v5.4). The GRADEpro was used to evaluate the certainty of evidence/summary of findings. Eleven RCTs assessing immunization uptake, completeness and/or timeliness by means of SMS, phone calls or a combination of voice message and SMS were included in both quantitative and qualitative synthesis. Overall, the included studies were of moderate quality. Majority of the included studies indicated that mobile phone reminders were beneficial. Meta-analyses indicated that using mobile phone reminder interventions for the review outcomes was of variable effect with high level of heterogeneity. A combination of voice message and SMS has a greater effect followed by phone calls then SMS reminders for immunization completeness. The use of SMS for immunization uptake and timeliness were largely insignificant (p > 0.05). Furthermore, evidence to support the efficacy of mobile phone reminder from the GRADE synthesis was between low and moderate. Mobile phone reminders, particularly a combination of voice message + SMS and perhaps phone calls appears to be more effective in enhancing immunization outcomes. However, more studies are required in view of methodological inadequacies in existing studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Immunizations are not required, leaving refugees at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. In response, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Department of State developed and co-funded a global immunization program for US-bound refugees, implemented in 2012 in collaboration with the International Organization for Migration. Methods: We describe the Vaccination Program for US-bound Refugees, including vaccination schedule development, program implementation and procedures, and responses to challenges. We estimate 2019 immunization coverage rates using the number of age-eligible refugees who received >= 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine during overseas health assessment, and calculated hepatitis B infection prevalence using hepatitis B surface antigen testing results. We report descriptive data on adverse events following immunization. Results: By September 2019, the program was active in >80 countries on five continents. Nearly 320,000 examined refugees had >= 1 documented vaccine doses since program inception. During federal fiscal year 2019, 95% of arriving refugees had >= 1 documented measles-containing vaccine. The program's immunization schedule included eleven vaccines preventing fourteen diseases. In 2015-2019, only two vaccine preventable disease-associated refugee group travel cancellations occurred, compared to 2-8 cancellations annually prior to program initiation. To maintain uniform standards, dedicated staff and program-specific protocols for vaccination and monitoring were introduced. Conclusions: An overseas immunization program was successfully implemented for US-bound refugees. Due to reductions in refugee movement cancellation, lower cost of immunization overseas, and likely reductions in vaccine preventable disease-associated morbidity, we anticipate significant cost savings. Although maintaining uniform standards across diverse settings is challenging, solutions such as introduction of dedicated staff, protocol development, and ongoing technical support have ensured program cohesion, continuity, and advancement. Lessons learned can benefit similar programs implemented in the migration setting. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: We defined two scenarios to explore key differences between static and dynamic models, herd immunity and time horizon. Scenario 1 evaluates the incremental cost/DALY of maternal acellular pertussis (aP) immunization as routine infant vaccination coverage ranges from low/moderate up to, and above, the threshold at which herd immunity begins to eliminate pertussis. Scenario 2 compares cost-effectiveness estimates over the models' different time horizons. Maternal vaccine prices of $9.55/dose (base case) and $1/dose were evaluated. Results: The dynamic model shows that maternal immunization could be cost-saving as well as life-saving at low levels of infant vaccination coverage. When infant coverage reaches the threshold range (90-95%), it is expensive: the dynamic model estimates that maternal immunization costs $2 million/ DALY at infant coverage > 95% and maternal vaccine price of $9.55/dose; at $1/dose, cost/DALY is $200,000. By contrast, the static model estimates costs/DALY only modestly higher at high than at low infant coverage. When the models' estimates over their different time horizons are compared at infant coverage < 90-95%, their projections fall in the same range. Conclusions: Static models may serve to explore an intervention's cost-effectiveness against infectious disease: the direction and principal drivers of change were the same in both models. When, however, an intervention too small to have significant herd immunity effects itself, such as maternal aP immunization, takes place against a background of vaccination in the rest of the population, a dynamic model is crucial to accurate estimates of cost-effectiveness.

Serogroup A, C, W, and Y meningococcal disease in persons previously vaccinated with a serogroup ACWY meningococcal vaccine-United States, 2014-2018	VACCINE			English	Article						Neisseria meningitidis; Meningococcal disease; MenACWY vaccine; Meningococcal vaccines	CONJUGATE VACCINE; IMMUNOGENICITY; SAFETY	Background: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination with a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate serogroup A,C,W,Y (MenACWY) vaccine at 11-12 years of age, with a booster dose at 16 years. ACIP also recommends meningococcal vaccination for persons at increased risk of meningococcal disease, including a 2-dose primary series and regular booster doses for persons at increased risk because of underlying medical conditions. U.S. cases of serogroup A, C, W, and Y meningococcal disease in persons previously vaccinated with MenACWY vaccine have not been systematically described since 2008. Characterization of these cases is important to understand potential factors leading to breakthrough disease. Methods: We analyzed cases of serogroup A,C,W, and Y meningococcal disease reported through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) from 2014 through 2018. State health departments submitted additional information on risk factors and clinical course. Results: During 2014-2018, 822 cases of serogroup A, C, W, and Y meningococcal disease were reported through NNDSS; 34 (4%) were in patients who previously received > 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine. Twenty-three vaccinated patients were up-to-date on MenACWY vaccine per recommendations, and seven were not up-to-date; four were missing information on the number of doses received. Seventeen cases (50%) occurred > 3 years after the most recent dose. A significantly higher proportion of vaccinated patients were people living with HIV (PLWH) compared to unvaccinated patients. Eight of the 34 vaccinated patients were immunosuppressed, including five PLWH, one taking eculizumab, and two taking other immunosuppressive medications. The case fatality ratio did not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Conclusions: Immunosuppression, incomplete vaccination, and waning immunity likely contributed to breakthrough cases of meningococcal disease among people who received MenACWY vaccine. Continued monitoring of serogroup A, C, W, and Y meningococcal disease in previously vaccinated persons will help inform meningococcal disease prevention efforts. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Seasonal influenza vaccination is associated with reduced risk of death among Medicare beneficiaries q	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza; Vaccination; Vaccine; Sepsis; mortality; Medicare	DOUBLY ROBUST ESTIMATION; SEPSIS; UPDATE	Background: Influenza causes substantial mortality, especially among older persons. Influenza vaccines are rarely more than 50% effective and rarely reach more than half of the US Medicare population, which is primarily an aged population. We wished to estimate the association between vaccination and mortality reduction. Method: We used the US Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) DataLink Project to determine vaccination status and timing during the 2017-2018 influenza season for more than 26 million Medicare enrollees. Patient-level demographic, health, co-morbidity, hospitalization, vaccination, and healthcare utilization claims data were supplied as covariates to general linear models in order to isolate and estimate the association between participation in the vaccination program and relative risk of death. Findings: The 2017-2018 seasonal influenza vaccine reduced (Relative Risk Ratio [RRR] 0.936 [95% CI = 0.918-0.954]) the risk of all-cause death among beneficiaries following a hospitalization for sepsis and moreover the risk of death without a prior hospitalization during the 2.5-month outcome window (RRR 0.870 [95% CI = 0.853-0.887]). We estimate the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent a death in the ten-week outcome window is between 1,515 beneficiaries (95% CI = 1,351-1,754; derived from the average treatment effect of augmented inverse probability weighting) and 1,960 beneficiaries (95% CI = 1,695-2,381; derived from the average marginal effect of logistic regression). Among beneficiaries requiring hospitalization, the greatest death risk reduction accrued to those 85 + years of age who were hospitalized with sepsis, RRR 0.92 [95% CI = 0.89-0.95]. No apparent benefit was realized by beneficiaries who required custodial (nursing home) care. Interpretation: Seasonal influenza immunization is associated with relative reduction of death risk among non-institutionalized Medicare beneficiaries.

J	Silas, J; Jones, A; Weiss-Cohen, L; Ayton, P				Silas, Jonathan; Jones, Alexander; Weiss-Cohen, Leonardo; Ayton, Peter			The seductive allure of technical language and its effect on covid-19 vaccine beliefs and intentions	VACCINE			English	Article						Seductive allure; COVID-19; Vaccination intentions; Vaccine hesitancy	UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS; KNOWLEDGE; LIMITS; BARON	Previous research has demonstrated a 'seductive allure' of technical or reductive language such that bad (e.g., circular) explanations are judged better when irrelevant technical terms are included. We aimed to explore if such an effect was observable in relation to a covid-19 vaccinations and if this subsequently affected behavioural intentions to take up a covid-19 vaccine. Using a between subjects design we presented participants (N = 996) with one of four possible types of vignette that explained how covid-19 vaccination and herd immunity works. The explanations varied along two factors: (1) Quality, explanations were either good or bad (i.e., tautological); (2) Language, explanations either contained unnecessary technical language or did not. We measured participants' evaluation of the explanations and intentions to vaccinate. We demonstrate a 'seductive allure' effect of technical language on bad vaccine explanations. However, an opposite 'repellent disdain' effect occurred for good explanations which were rated worse when they contained technical language. Moreover, we show that evaluations of explanations influence intentions to vaccinate. We suggest that misinformation that includes technical language could be more detrimental to vaccination rates.

However, ELISA does not match the needs of a modernised quality control system. For a long time, human rabies virus vaccine manufacturers have been devoted to seeking a detection platform that is sensitive, accurate, automatic, and feasible for practical applications. Therefore, our team invested major efforts into establishing a fully automated micromagnetic particle (MMP)-based chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) platform. For vaccine quality control, MMP-coupled rabies virus glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies (S037) were used to capture the rabies virus. Another rabies virus glycoprotein antibody (S053) labelled with acridinium ester was added as a signal tracer. After pretreating the vaccine sample, the entire analysis was performed using a fully automated machine, which had a limited detection time (only 30 min) and eliminated manual error. Multiple experiments have identified the optimal conditions allowing valid and reliable assessment of vaccine potency. The CLIA platform has exhibited merits in terms of speed, robustness, high sensitivity (with a minimum detection value of 0.45 mIU/mL), considerable accuracy, and a wide linear range of detection (9.4-1200 mIU/mL). Furthermore, the results showed that the CLIA platform is consistent with the National Institutes of Health test and time-resolved fluorescent immunoassay (TRFIA) in quantitative analysis, and had a better analytic performance than TRFIA. Therefore, the CLIA platform presented here may be important for application in modern vaccine quality control. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The economic burden of rotavirus hospitalization among children < 5 years of age in selected hospitals in Bangladesh	VACCINE			English	Article						Economic burden; Rotavirus gastroenteritis; Diarrhea; Costs-of-illness; Catastrophic health expenditure; Bangladesh	HEALTH-CARE; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; RURAL BANGLADESH; DIARRHEA; GASTROENTERITIS; ILLNESS; SURVEILLANCE; EXPENDITURE; MORTALITY; IMPACT	Background: Rotavirus is a common cause of severe acute gastroenteritis among young children. Estimation of the economic burden would provide informed decision about investment on prevention strategies (e.g., vaccine and/or behavior change), which has been a potential policy discussion in Bangladesh for several years. Methods: We estimated the societal costs of children <5 years for hospitalization from rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) and incidences of catastrophic health expenditure. A total of 360 children with stool specimens positive for rotavirus were included in this study from 6 tertiary hospitals (3 public and 3 private). We interviewed the caregiver of the patient and hospital staff to collect cost from patient and health facility perspectives. We estimated the economic cost considering 2015 as the reference year. Results: The total societal per-patient costs to treat RVGE in the public hospital were 126 USD (95% CI: 116-136) and total household costs were 161 USD (95% CI: 145-177) in private facilities. Direct costs constituted 38.1% of total household costs. The out-of-pocket payments for RVGE hospitalization was 23% of monthly income and 76% of households faced catastrophic healthcare expenditures due to this expense. The estimated total annual household treatment cost for the country was 10 million USD. Conclusions: A substantial economic burden of RVGE in Bangladesh was observed in this study. Any prevention of RVGE through cost-effective vaccination or/and behavioural change would contribute to substantial economic benefits to Bangladesh. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Infant serotype specific anti-capsular immunoglobulin G antibody and risk of invasive group B Streptococcal disease	VACCINE			English	Article						Group B Streptococcus; Antibodies; Maternal vaccine	PROTECTION; MULTICENTER; LEVEL	Past studies have mainly investigated the association of serotype-specific capsular IgG in the mother and risk reduction of invasive Group B Streptococcus (GBS) in their young infants. The efficiency of transplacental transfer of IgG could be affected by multiple maternal factors. Hence, investigation of infant serum GBS anti-capsular IgG and risk reduction for invasive GBS disease may be more robust and generalizable. In a matched case-control study, infant serum serotype-specific capsular polysaccharide Ia and III IgG concentrations were analyzed in infants with invasive GBS cases and healthy controls born to women with recto-vaginal colonization by the homotypic serotype. Using Bayesian modeling, an antibody concentration of 2.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL predicted a 90% reduced risk of invasive disease for serotype Ia and III, respectively. These data contribute to the possible licensure of a GBS polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine, targeted at pregnant women, based on serological correlates of protection against invasive GBS disease.

However, the lack of compliance with microplanning processes, contributes to improper estimation of resources needed for a good SIA in Nigeria. We described the microplanning verification process for 2017/2018 measles vaccination campaign and highlighted the contribution of selected variables to the output of the microplan. Methods: We conducted microplanning verification in 2 phases. In Phase 1, we verified at least 30% of randomly selected microplans to assess compliance with the steps and processes of developing good microplans. In Phase 2 we conducted desk review of the entire states micoplans and verified some selected variables at the ward level to corroborate the findings of the microplans. We collected data using open data kit and verification checklist. We conducted data analysis using SPSS and Microsoft Excel version 2016. Results: All states in Nigeria verified their wards' microplans, 21 states (57%) verified more than 30% ,16 states (43%) verified less than 30%, Kebbi State verified the lowest (5.3%). Over 90% of microplans verified complied with the microplanning processes. We observed that overall, there was no significant difference in the number of target population, vaccination teams and qualified vaccinators after the verification process. Conclusion: The microplans for 2017/2018 measles vaccination campaign were developed according to the required procesesses, the target population, vaccination teams and qualified vaccinators were physically and realistically estimated. Adherence to microplanning processes is critical to the success of immunization programs. (C) 2021 World Health Organization. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Intranasal vaccination with protein bodies elicit strong protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization	VACCINE			English	Article						Streptococcus pneumoniae; Protein bodies; Intranasal vaccine; Colonization	INCLUSION-BODIES; CYSTEINE PROTEINASE; FASCIOLA-HEPATICA; VACCINES; IMMUNITY; ANTIGEN; CELL; RESPONSES; BACTERIA; DISEASE	Protein bodies (PBs) are particles consisting of insoluble, aggregated proteins with potential as a vaccine formulation. PBs can contain high concentrations of antigen, are stable and relatively resistant to proteases, release antigen slowly and are cost-effective to manufacture. Yet, the capacity of PBs to pro-voke immune responses and protection in the upper respiratory tract, a major entry route of respiratory pathogens, is largely unknown. In this study, we vaccinated mice intranasally with PBs comprising antigens from Streptococcus pneu-moniae and evaluated the level of protection against nasopharyngeal colonization. PBs composed of the alpha-helical domain of pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA alpha) provided superior protection against colonization with S. pneumoniae compared to soluble PspA alpha. Immunization with soluble protein or PBs induced differences in antibody binding to pneumococci as well as a highly distinct antigen-specific nasal cytokine profile upon in vivo stimulation with inactivated S. pneumoniae. Moreover, immunization with PBs composed of conserved putative pneumococcal antigens reduced colonization by S. pneumoniae in mice, both as a single- and as a multi-antigen formulation. In conclusion, PBs represent a vaccine formulation that elicits strong mucosal immune responses and protection. The versatility of this platform offers opportunities for development of next-generation vaccine formulations. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[van Beek, L. F.; Langereis, J.

A systems map of the economic considerations for vaccination: Application to hard-to-reach populations	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccination costs; Systems map; Hard-to-reach; Economic benefits	ROUTINE IMMUNIZATION; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; SUPPLY CHAINS; IMPACT; VACCINES; PROGRAM; DISEASE	Background: Understanding the economics of vaccination is essential to developing immunization strategies that can be employed successfully with limited resources, especially when vaccinating populations that are hard-to-reach. Methods: Based on the input from interviews with 24 global experts on immunization economics, we developed a systems map of the mechanisms (i.e., necessary steps or components) involved in vaccination, and associated costs and benefits, focused at the service delivery level. We used this to identify the mechanisms that may be different for hard-to-reach populations . Results: The systems map shows different mechanisms that determine whether a person may or may not get vaccinated and the potential health and economic impacts of doing so. The map is divided into two parts: 1) the costs of vaccination, representing each of the mechanisms involved in getting vaccinated (n = 23 vaccination mechanisms), their associated direct vaccination costs (n = 18 vaccination costs), and opportunity costs (n = 5 opportunity costs), 2) the impact of vaccination, representing mechanisms after vaccine delivery (n = 13 impact mechanisms), their associated health effects (n = 10 health effects for beneficiary and others), and economic benefits (n = 13 immediate and secondary economic benefits and costs). Mechanisms that, when interrupted or delayed, can result in populations becoming hardto-reach include getting vaccines and key stakeholders (e.g., beneficiaries/caregivers, vaccinators) to a vaccination site, as well as vaccine administration at the site. Conclusion: Decision-makers can use this systems map to understand where steps in the vaccination process may be interrupted or weak and identify where gaps exist in the understanding of the economics of vaccination. With improved understanding of system-wide effects, this map can help decision-makers inform targeted interventions and policies to increase vaccination coverage in hard-to-reach populations.

NITAGs faced challenges using their routine approach to develop recommendations for COVID19 vaccines during the pandemic. In response, the WHO Regional Office for Europe (Regional Office), with the support of the Robert Koch Institute, developed an innovative approach of a series of webinars, provision of materials, and remote technical assistance to address these challenges. Polls conducted during webinars were used to tailor future webinars and evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions. According to poll results, 76% of participants found the webinars and resources shared very useful in their work on COVID-19 vaccination.

Partnering for rotavirus vaccine introduction in India: A retrospective analysis	VACCINE			English	Review						Immunization; Public-Private Partnership; RVV; Rotavirus; UIP	HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS; EFFICACY; LEGACY	Background: The pre-existing partner network created in India for the delivery of polio vaccines was ini-tially used to eradicate polio and later on embedded in the health systems network to promote routine immunization and other health interventions efficiently. The experience from this network offered les -sons for strengthening the health care systems and provided a well-established network that could be utilized for other vaccine initiatives. It has also been established that successful partnerships between a broad range of stakeholders provide support, strengthen the health system, and accelerate vaccine innovation, introduction, access, logistics, and communication support. However, beyond polio eradica-tion, there have not been too many documented success stories of vaccine introduction, which could be replicated in other new vaccine introductions and allied health initiatives. The authors have reviewed the successful and time-bound introduction of rotavirus vaccine (RVV) in India in the present article. Methods: The review was conducted based on a partnership framework which analysed multiple factors-partnership prerequisites, partnership model, partnership process, and partnership performance, thereby providing a comprehensive insight into the successful utilization of partnership networks for rotavirus vaccine introduction under the Universal Immunization Program in India. Results & conclusion: The review also highlights the role of a lead agency in creating a fertile ground for lush, efficient, and effective partnerships amongst different stakeholders. The already existing RVV part-nership framework reviewed by the authors can be successfully utilized for future new vaccine introductions. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nicholson			Collaboration in times of crisis: A study on COVID-19 vaccine R&D partnerships	VACCINE			English	Article						Collaboration; Knowledge sharing; COVID-19; Pandemic; IP; Vaccine	PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS	Collaboration is central for initiatives and efforts in the race to fight COVID-19, with particular focus on fostering rapid development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. We investigated the types of partnerships that have emerged during the pandemic to develop these products. Using the World Health Organization's list of COVID-19 vaccine developments, we found nearly one third of all vaccine candidates were developed by partnerships, which tended to use next-gen vaccine platforms more than solo efforts. These partnerships vary substantially between materials-transfer partnerships and knowledge sharing partnerships. The difference is important: The type of sharing between partners not only shapes the collaboration, but also bears implications for knowledge and technology development in the field and more broadly. Policies promoting fair and effective collaboration and knowledge-sharing are key for public health to avoid stumbling blocks for vaccine development, deployment, and equitable access, both for COVID-19 and expected future pandemics.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 mRNA) has been shown to be highly effective and it is recommended for individuals aged >16 years, including pregnant women, although the vaccine has not been tested on the latter. Objective: To study the association between prenatal Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination, pregnancy course and outcomes. Study design: A retrospective cohort study was performed, including all women who delivered between January and June 2021 at Soroka University Medical Center, the largest birth center in Israel. Excluded were women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past, multiple gestations or unknown vaccination status. Pregnancy, delivery and newborn complications were compared between women who received 1 or 2 dose vaccines during pregnancy and unvaccinated women. Multivariable models were used to adjust for background characteristics. Results: A total of 4,399 women participated in this study, 913 (20.8%) of which were vaccinated during pregnancy. All vaccinations occurred during second or third trimesters. As compared to the unvaccinated women, vaccinated women were older, more likely to conceive following fertility treatments, to have sufficient prenatal care, and of higher socioeconomic position. In both crude and multivariable analyses, no differences were found between the groups in pregnancy, delivery and newborn complications, including gestational age at delivery, incidence of small for gestational age and newborn respiratory complications. Conclusions: Prenatal maternal COVID-19 vaccine has no adverse effects on pregnancy course and outcomes. These findings may help pregnant women and health care providers to make informed decision regarding vaccination. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There are currently several licensed vaccines approved for human use and most of them target the spike protein in the virion envelope to induce protective immunity. Recently, variants that spread more quickly have emerged. There is evidence that some of these variants are less sensitive to neutralization in vitro, but it is not clear whether they can evade vaccine induced protection. In this study, we tested SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD as a vaccine antigen and explored the effect of formulation with Alum/MPLA or AddaS03 adjuvants. Our results show that RBD induces high titers of neutralizing antibodies and activates strong cellular immune responses. There is also significant cross-neutralization of variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 and to a lesser extent, SARS-CoV-1. These results indicate that recombinant RBD can be a viable candidate as a stand-alone vaccine or as a booster shot to diversify our strategy for COVID19 protection. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Association among trust in health care providers, friends, and family, and vaccine hesitancy	VACCINE			English	Article								A health care provider's vaccination recommendation is one of the most important factors influencing parents' decisions about whether to vaccinate their children. Unfortunately, vaccine hesitancy is associated with mistrust of health care providers and the medical system. We conducted a survey of 2440 adults through the RAND American Life Panel in 2019. Respondents were asked to rate their trust in pediatricians, OB/GYNs, doulas, midwives, lactation consultants, friends and family for information about childhood vaccines. Respondents were also asked about willingness to vaccinate a hypothetical child as a measure of vaccine hesitancy. We used principal component analysis to characterize variance in responses on trust items and logistic regression to model the relationship between trust and vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with: (1) lower overall trust; (2) reduced trust in OB/GYNs and pediatricians and greater trust in doulas, midwives, and lactation consultants; and (3) greater trust in friends and family.

A large repertoire of B cell lineages targeting one cluster of epitopes in a vaccinated rhesus macaque	VACCINE			English	Article						Repertoire of antibodies; Vaccine-induced antibodies; V3 monoclonal antibodies; Non-human primates' immunization; Rhesus macaque immunoglobulin genes	NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; CROSS-REACTIVITY; INDUCTION; HIV-1	The repertoire of antibodies (Abs) produced upon vaccination against a particular antigenic site is rarely studied due to the complexity of the immunogens. We received such an opportunity when one rhesus macaque was immunized six times at 0, 4, 10, 16, 32, and 143 weeks with C4-447 peptide containing the 8-mer epitope for human monoclonal Ab (mAb) 447-52D specific to the V3 region of gp120 HIV-1. Strong anti-V3 antibody responses reached 50% binding titer in serum of 10(-5) at week 10 that declined to 10(-3) by week 70. After an additional boost of C4-447 peptide at week 143, titers rebounded to 10(-5) at week 146, or 2.7 years after the first immunization. Using the blood sample at week 146, we produced 41 V3-specific recombinant mAbs by single B cell isolation and cloning. Sequence analysis revealed 21B cell lineages, single and clonally related, based on immunoglobulin gene usage and CDR3s. The broad repertoire of Abs directed to a small antigenic site shows the targeting potency of a vaccine-elicited immune response in rhesus macaques. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We therefore sought to evaluate the protective efficacy in mice of an M2-based influenza vaccine (CapM2e) formulated with Advax-SM adjuvant. Vaccine protection was assessed via both passive maternal immunization and direct neonatal immunization. Methods: For maternal transfer studies, female mice were immunized 1 week before and after mating. Blood was collected from both mother and offspring during weaning and pups were challenged when they reached 3 weeks of age with lethal doses of H1N1 and homologous reassortment influenza strain H3N2 with conserved M2. For direct immunization studies, newborns were immunized at 1 and 3 weeks of age and blood was collected prior to challenge at 4 weeks of age. Results: Maternal immunization with CapM2e + Advax-SM vaccine induced high maternal M2e antibody levels that were passively transferred to their offspring and provided them with protection against both H1N1 and H3N2 influenza strains when challenged at 3 weeks of age. When used for direct immunization of neonatal mice, CapM2e + Advax-SM vaccine similarly induced high serum M2e antibody levels and protected against H1N1 and H3N2 influenza challenges with protection associated with inhibition of virus replication with a significant reduction in lung virus load in immunized pups. Conclusion: CapM2e + Advax-SM vaccine could be useful for protecting newborns against diverse influenza A strains, with opportunities to achieve protection by passive maternal immunization or active neonatal immunization. This data supports further development of this promising M2e-based vaccine candidate. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Human ferritin has advantages of uniform architecture, robust thermal and chemical stabilities, and good biocompatibility and biodegradation. There is however a lack of understanding about the relationship between insertion sites in ferritin (N-terminus and C-terminus) and the corresponding humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. To bridge this gap, we utilized an Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1) epitope as a model to produce engineered ferritin-based vaccines E1F1 (N-terminus insertion) and F1E1 (C-terminus insertion) for the prevention of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections. Xray crystallography confirmed the relative positions of the N-terminus insertion and C-terminus insertion. For N-terminus insertion, the epitopes were located on the exterior surface of ferritin, while for C-terminus insertion, the epitopes were inside the ferritin cage. Based on the results of antigen specific antibody titers from in-vivo tests, we found that there was no obvious difference on humoral immune responses between N-terminus and C-terminus insertion. We also evaluated splenocyte proliferation and memory lymphocyte T cell differentiation. Both results suggested C-terminus insertion produced a stronger proliferative response and cell-mediated immune response than N-terminus insertion. C-terminus insertion of EBNA1 epitope was also processed more efficiently by dendritic cells (DCs) than N-terminus insertion. This provides new insight into the relationship between the insertion site and immunogenicity of ferritin nanoparticle vaccines. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Comparison of immunogenicity and safety of licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccines: A systematic review and network meta-analysis	VACCINE			English	Review						Japanese encephalitis; Vaccination; Adverse events; Severe; Seroconversion; Efficacy	CHIMERIC VIRUS-VACCINE; CLINICAL-TRIALS; DOUBLE-BLIND; PHASE-III; FOLLOW-UP; ANTIBODY-RESPONSE; TOLERABILITY; CHILDREN; IMMUNITY; IC51	Introduction: Annually more than 100,000 Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases and 25,000 deaths worldwide are caused by JE virus infection. More than 15 JE vaccines are currently in use worldwide. It is unknown whether any of the vaccines is superior to the others in terms of immunogenicity and safety. Methods: Four databases were systematically searched for randomised controlled trials that compared two or more types of JE vaccines. Vaccines were classified into four classes: inactivated mouse brain derived (oldest class), inactivated Vero cell, live chimeric, and live attenuated. Network meta-analysis was used to generate mixed effect estimates against inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccines for seroconversion, and against placebo for adverse event (AE) and severe adverse event (SAE). Results: 23 studies (38,496 participants) were included. All newer vaccine classes had better immunogenicity, the difference was statistically significant for inactivated Vero cell (OR = 2.98; 95 %CI: 1.02- 8.65) and live chimeric (OR = 5.93; 95 %CI: 1.73-20.32) vaccines. Inactivated mouse-derived vaccines had the highest odds for AEs (OR = 2.27; 95 %CI: 1.59-3.23), the odds of AE of newer vaccines was not different to placebo. There was no difference in SAEs across vaccine classes. Conclusions: All newer JE vaccines have comparable safety profiles, live chimeric and inactivated Vero cell vaccines are the most immunogenic among the newer vaccine classes. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Recognizing enterovirus 71 (EV71) as the most important pathogen in severe hand, foot and mouth disease, an inactivated EV71 vaccine was successfully marketed in 2015. Based on the concept of one vaccine preventing two diseases and owing to similarities in vaccine preparation and the overlap of the eligible population, a combination of the inactivated HAV vaccine and inactivated EV71 vaccine is theoretically feasible and desirable. However, the optimal vaccination schedule for this combination vaccine has yet to be optimized. Use of this combined vaccine would not only decrease the number of vaccinations, but also lower associated cost. This study aimed to investigate the toxicity and adverse reactions of the combined HAV-EV71 vaccine under Good Laboratory Practice conditions to provide a reference for clinical studies/applications in the future. CD (R)(Sprague Dawley) IGS rats were employed for single-dose toxicity testing using a high dose, and repeated-dose toxicity testing using high, as well as low doses. Animals that received only a single dose showed no obvious clinical symptoms nor abnormal body weight, and no significant gross pathological change at the experimental endpoint at necropsy. In the rats injected with three doses, phagocytosis of basophilic granules by macrophages was observed in the inguinal, mesenteric, and local lymph nodes, besides irritation at the administration site. At 56 days after the last dose, no significant histopathological change was observed in the lymph nodes, and local irritation gradually faded. Further, systematic allergy testing was performed in guinea pigs. After systemic sensitization and challenge with the HAV-EV71 vaccine, animals showed normal weight gain and no allergic reactions. This study, therefore, confirmed a good safety profile of the inactivated HAV and EV71 combined vaccine. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, many were pleasantly surprised: the 2020 Southern Hemisphere and 2020-2021 Northern Hemisphere influenza seasons were entirely suppressed. The potential causes and impacts of this drastic public health shift are highly uncertain, but provide lessons about future control of respiratory diseases, especially for the upcoming influenza season.

The impact of PCV13 on the overall incidence of PPE/PE in children is unclear. Methods: Annual incidence of PPE/PE in children were determined using secondary health care data for 2009-2018, provided by the Barmer statutory health insurer, serving about 11% of the German population. Temporal trends of the annual incidence were modelled applying generalized additive models. Results: Overall incidence of PPE/PE in children (<= 18 years) in the ten-year observation period was 18.17 per 100,000. The 0-1 year olds showed the highest incidence (43.09 per 100 000). PPE/PE incidence decreased from 2009 until 2013 (nadir 2013 was 15.36; 95% CI: 13.41-17.31). Since 2013, the data show an annual increase. The nadir of incidence for the 2-5 year olds (15.85; 95% CI: 11.27-20.43) and the 6-18 year olds (12.29; 95% CI: 10.23-14.36) was also in 2013, whereas for the 0-1 year olds it was found in 2014 (32.66; 95% CI: 23.79-41.54). The GAM across all age groups showed a nearly U-shaped curve between time and incidence of PPE/PE by calendar year (p-non-linear = 0.0017). The model confirms the nadir in the year 2013. Discussion: We found a nonlinear temporal trend of PPE/PE incidence in children with a decrease from 2009 to 2013 and a subsequent increase until 2018. The former might be explained by a quasi elimination of serotype 1, the latter by an increase in the proportion of serotype 3 as demonstrated in German surveillance data of pediatric PPE/PE cases generated during the same observation period.

In order to control the disease, we previously described Entry Competent Replication Abortive (ECRA) virus strains for each of the nine distinct AHSV serotypes and demonstrated their potential as vaccines, first in type I interferon receptor (IFNAR-/-) knockout mice, and then in ponies. In this report we have investigated whether or not a combination ECRA vaccine comprising nine vaccine strains as two different cocktails is as efficient in ponies and the duration of the immunity triggered by ECRA vaccines. In one study, a group of ponies were vaccinated with a cocktail of 4 vaccine strains, followed by a vaccination of the remaining 5 vaccine strains, mimicking the current live attenuated vaccine regimen. In the second study, ponies were vaccinated with a single ECRA-AHSV strain and monitored for 6 months. The first group of ponies developed neutralising antibody responses against all 9 serotypes, indicating that no cross-serotype interference occurred, while the second group developed robust neutralising antibody responses against the single serotype that were sustained at the same level throughout a 6-month study. The results support our previous data and further validate ECRA vaccines as a safe and efficacious replacement of current live vaccines. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Brighton Collaboration Viral Vecto	The Brighton Collaboration standardized template for collection of key information for risk/benefit assessment of a Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine platform	VACCINE			English	Review						Brighton Collaboration; Ebola vaccine; Smallpox vaccine; Risk; benefit assessment; Vaccine safety; Vaccines; Vaccinia; Modified Vaccinia Ankara; Viral vector	VIRUS ANKARA; SMALLPOX VACCINE; HOST-RANGE; THERAPEUTIC VACCINATION; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES; GENOMIC SEQUENCE; PHASE-I; IMMUNOGENICITY; SAFETY	The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V3SWG) was formed to evaluate the safety and characteristics of live, recombinant viral vector vaccines. The Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector system is being explored as a platform for development of multiple vaccines. This paper reviews the molecular and biological features specifically of the MVA-BN vector system, followed by a template with details on the safety and characteristics of an MVA-BN based vaccine against Zaire ebolavirus and other filovirus strains. The MVA-BN-Filo vaccine is based on a live, highly attenuated poxviral vector incapable of replicating in human cells and encodes glycoproteins of Ebola virus Zaire, Sudan virus and Marburg virus and the nucleoprotein of the Thai Forest virus. This vaccine has been approved in the European Union in July 2020 as part of a heterologous Ebola vaccination regimen. The MVA-BN vector is attenuated following over 500 serial passages in eggs, showing restricted host tropism and incompetence to replicate in human cells. MVA has six major deletions and other mutations of genes outside these deletions, which all contribute to the replication deficiency in human and other mammalian cells. Attenuation of MVA-BN was demonstrated by safe administration in immunocompromised mice and non-human primates. In multiple clinical trials with the MVA-BN backbone, more than 7800 participants have been vaccinated, demonstrating a safety profile consistent with other licensed, modern vaccines. MVA-BN has been approved as smallpox vaccine in Europe and Canada in 2013, and as smallpox and monkeypox vaccine in the US in 2019. No signal for inflammatory cardiac disorders was identified throughout the MVA-BN development program. This is in sharp contrast to the older, replicating vaccinia smallpox vaccines, which have a known risk for myocarditis and/or pericarditis in up to 1 in 200 vaccinees. MVA-BN-Filo as part of a heterologous Ebola vaccination regimen (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo) has undergone clinical testing including Phase III in West Africa and is currently in use in large scale vaccination studies in Central African countries. This paper provides a comprehensive picture of the MVA-BN vector, which has reached regulatory approvals, both as MVA-BN backbone for smallpox/monkeypox, as well as for the MVA-BN-Filo construct as part of an Ebola vaccination regimen, and therefore aims to provide solutions to prevent disease from high-consequence human pathogens.

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) prevents early-onset disease (EOD), but has no effect on late-onset disease (LOD). A potential maternal GBS vaccine could prevent both EOD and LOD by conferring immunity in neonates. Objective: Explore under which circumstances maternal vaccination against GBS would be cost-effective as an addition to, or replacement for the current risk factor-based IAP prevention strategy in the Netherlands. Methods: We assessed the maximum cost-effective price per dose of a trivalent (serotypes Ia, Ib, and III) and hexavalent (additional serotypes II, IV, and V) GBS vaccine in addition to, or as a replacement for IAP. To project the prevented costs and disease burden, a decision tree model was developed to reflect neonatal GBS disease and long-term health outcomes among a cohort based on 169,836 live births in the Netherlands in 2017. Results: Under base-case conditions, maternal immunization with a trivalent vaccine would gain 186 QALYs and prevent more than (sic)3.1 million in health care costs when implemented in addition to IAP. Immunization implemented as a replacement for IAP would gain 88 QALYs compared to the current prevention strategy, prevent (sic)1.5 million in health care costs, and avoid potentially similar to 30,000 IAP administrations. The base-case results correspond to a maximum price of (sic)58 per dose (vaccine + administration costs; using a threshold of (sic)20,000/QALY). Expanding the serotype coverage to a hexavalent vaccine would only have a limited additional impact on the cost-effectiveness in the Netherlands. Conclusions: A maternal GBS vaccine could be cost-effective when implemented in addition to the current risk factor-based IAP prevention strategy in the Netherlands. Discontinuation of IAP would save costs and prevent antibiotic use, however, is projected to lead to a lower health gain compared to vaccination in addition to IAP. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Using the power law model to predict the long-term persistence and duration of detectable hepatitis A antibody after receipt of hepatitis A vaccine (VAQTA (TM))	VACCINE			English	Article						Hepatitis A; Vaccine; Persistence; Duration; Power law model	CONTROLLED TRIAL; IMMUNOGENICITY; SAFETY; TOLERABILITY; ADULTS; VAQTA((R))	VAQTA (TM) (Hepatitis A Vaccine, inactivated [HAVi]; Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA) is currently licensed for prevention of disease caused by hepatitis A virus in persons >= 12 months of age. This report summarizes statistical models developed to evaluate the long-term persistence and duration of detectable hepatitis A antibody (total antibody levels with no distinction on class) after receipt of HAVi in healthy children and adolescents (V251-023 and V251-035) and in healthy adults (V251-034). The statistical models presented, conducted separately for each of the three studies, are based on models that have been used in the literature to estimate the duration of antibody to protect against human papillomavirus (HPV) disease. In the absence of observed study data on hepatitis A antibody persistence for vaccine recipients over several decades, an extrapolation from a kinetic model of antibody decay was used to estimate the duration of detectable antibody. Extrapolation of observed antibody titers from postvaccination, Year 2.5-3.5, Year 5-6, and Year 10 in 165 children and adolescents who received HAVi at Day 0 and Week 24 in V251-023 suggests that detectable levels of antibody may persist after the second dose for many years. This model suggests that 25 to 50 years Postdose 1 in a two-dose series of HAVi, 99.4% of the study population will have detectable levels of hepatitis A antibody. (C) 2021 The Authors.

We aimed to assess the impact of childhood PCV immunisation on all-cause pneumonia (ACP) admissions among the overall population of HK. Methods: In this population-based interrupted time series analysis, we used territory-wide population representative electronic health records in HK to evaluate the vaccine impact. We identified hospitalised patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia from any cause between 2004 and 2017. We applied segmented Poisson regression to assess the gradual change in the monthly incidence of ACP admissions between pre and post-vaccination periods. Negative outcome control, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of the main analysis. Findings: Over the 14-year study period, a total of 587,607 ACP episodes were identified among 357,950 patients. The monthly age-standardised incidence of ACP fluctuated between 33.42 and 87.44 per 100,000-persons. There was a marginal decreasing trend in pneumonia admissions after PCV introduction among overall population (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.9965, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9932-0.99 98), and older adults (>= 65 years, IRR: 0.9928, 95% CI: 0.9904-0.9953) but not in younger age groups. Interpretation: There was a marginally declining trend of overall ACP admissions in HK up to eight years after childhood PCV introduction. The significance disappeared when fitting sensitivity analyses. The results indicate the complexities of using non-specific endpoints for measuring vaccine effect and the necessity of enhancing serotype surveillance systems for replacement monitoring.

We explored the long-term persistence of immunogenicity induced by different hepatitis B vaccine regimens in hemodialysis patients. Methods: In initial study, we conducted a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-controlled trial among hemodialysis patients in 13 hospitals in Shanxi Province, China. A total of 352 hemodialysis patients were allocated to receive 3-dose 20 mu g (IM20 group) and 3-dose 60 lg (IM60 group) recombinant hepatitis B vaccine at months 0, 1, and 6. Vaccine-induced immune responses were measured at month 7. In this study, the responders (anti-HBs >= 10 mIU/mL) were followed up at months 18, 24, 30, 36 and 42, respectively. We used the generalized log-rank test and generalized estimating equations (GEE) to analyze the long-term durability of responses and the kinetics of anti-HBs levels, respectively. Results: A total of 284 patients were involved in the extended follow-up period. The duration of vaccine induced response with 75% of patients maintained protective antibody were 12 months and 18 months in the IM20 group and IM60 group, respectively (P = 0.291). The long-term persistent immunogenicity induced by 3-dose 60 lg was more satisfactory than that by 3-dose 20 lg hepatitis B vaccine in patients with hemodialysis duration >= five years (P = 0.023). The peak anti-HBs levels in 100-1000 mIU/mL or >= 1000 mIU/mL were more likely to maintain long-term protective antibody compared to anti-HBs levels in 10-100 mIU/mL (P < 0.05). The kinetic profile was similar between the two groups (P = 0.334). Conclusion: High-dose 60 mu g hepatitis B vaccine could lead a satisfactory long-term durability of immunogenicity among patients with hemodialysis duration of five years or more. Peak anti-HBs level after vaccination was associated with the long-term persistence of immunogenicity. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A systematic literature review was conducted to establish the duration and magnitude of cross-protection in interventional and observational studies. Methods: PubMed and Embase databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies published between 2008 and 2019 reporting on efficacy and effectiveness of HPV vaccines in women against non-vaccine types 31, 33, 45, 52, 58, and 6 and 11 (non-bivalent types). Key outcomes of interest were vaccine efficacy against 6- and 12-month persistent infection or genital lesions, and type-specific genital HPV prevalence or incidence. RCT data were analyzed for the according-to-protocol (bivalent vaccine) or negative-for-14-HPV-types (quadrivalent vaccine) efficacy cohorts. Results: Data from 23 RCTs and 33 observational studies evaluating cross-protection were extracted. RCTs assessed cross-protection in post-hoc analyses of small size subgroups. Among fully vaccinated, baseline HPV-naive women, the bivalent vaccine showed statistically significant cross-protective efficacy, although with wide confidence intervals, against 6-month and 12-month persistent cervical infections and CIN2+ only consistently for HPV 31 and 45, with the highest effect observed for HPV 31 (range 64.6% [95% CI: 27.6 to 83.9] to 79.1% [97.7% CI: 27.6 to 95.9] for 6-month persistent infection; maximal follow-up 4.7 years). No cross-protection was shown in extended follow-up. The quadrivalent vaccine efficacy reached statistical significance for HPV 31 (46.2% [15.3-66.4]; follow-up: 3.6 years). Similarly, observational studies found consistently significant effectiveness only against HPV 31 and 45 with both vaccines. Conclusions: RCTs and observational studies show that cross-protection is inconsistent across non-vaccine HPV types and is largely driven by HPV 31 and 45. Furthermore, existing data suggest that it wanes over time; its long-term durability has not been established. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger initiated iSC system design efforts to conduct analysis of alternative supply chain scenarios to identify areas for improvement. Methodology: Key stakeholders from Ministries of Health and immunization programs identified bottlenecks in the current iSC and prioritized five general design scenarios to model in each country. Scenarios included aspects of integration, changing supply chain levels and delivery frequency, ignoring administrative boundaries, and direct delivery. Primary and secondary data were collected and cleaned. Analysis was completed using Supply Chain Guru (Madagascar and Niger) and AnyLogistix (Guinea) modeling software to build a virtual representation of the iSC physical components and operating policies. Results: Modeling results were compared using both quantitative and qualitative criteria (total operating costs, cost per dose, cold chain capacity, risk of mishandling, logistics burden on healthcare workers, feasibility to implement, and equity). Using a Stop Light Analysis for user-friendly understanding of positive, negative or minimal impact on scenarios, cost savings were realized in most scenarios in Madagascar (except using autonomous aerial vehicles); proposed scenarios in Guinea increased costs or had minimal impact; in Niger, eliminating regional tiers reduced costs. Facility level cold chain was sufficient in all countries. Effect on qualitative indicators largely depended on the scenario and country context. Discussion: Similarities in scenarios selected were seen across the three countries. Results suggest that efficiencies can be found through changes to the iSC design, but the benefits of each scenario must be considered in the country context. Results of the analysis do not provide "the right answer" but rather options and guidance which then must be grounded in the country context and used as evidence for decision making to ensure reliable availability of vaccines.

PATIENTS: Included were 104 pts with leukaemia, myeloma and lymphoma, median age 61 yrs. METHODS: Vaccine (FSME-Immun (R)) was given at 9, 10, 12, and 21 months post-transplant. Serum samples were obtained before and after vaccinations. Healthy controls (n = 27) received 3 vaccinations. Assessments of TBE specific IgG antibodies were performed by Enzygnost anti-TBE ELISA test (Siemens, Sweden). Results: Antibody levels (>12 U/mL; "seropositivity") were seen in 77% and 80% of pts after allo- and autoSCT; IgG levels; 89 vs 94 U/mL. Ongoing chronic GvHD and immunosuppression (n = 29) was associated with sero-negativity in the last sample (p = 0.007). All controls (n = 27) developed protective antibody levels. Conclusions: TBE vaccination was safe, and 4 doses starting 9 months post-SCT, induced seropositivity in a vast majority of pts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As there is no causal treatment of TBE, disease prevention by vaccination is especially important. Immunization consists of a three-dose primary vaccination schedule, followed by regular booster doses. In Germany, the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) at the Robert Koch-Institute recommends TBE vaccination for all those at high risk of contracting TBE. This includes individuals living in, traveling to and/or working in risk areas, and being exposed to ticks. To our knowledge, there are currently no reliable data on TBE vaccination rates in Germany available. Methods: This retrospective cohort study based on anonymized German health claims data was conducted to determine vaccination rates of TBE primary immunization in 2012 to 2015 by federal state, compliance with the vaccination schedule, and TBE vaccination uptake for the 2011 birth cohort. Vaccination protection rates for each federal state were simulated based on a compartmental model. Results: Vaccination rates of an initiated primary immunization ranged from about 3% in the southern federal states to <1% in the northern federal states. Across all federal states, compliance with the vaccination schedule decreased with each subsequent vaccination. Slightly higher TBE vaccination uptake was determined in the 2011 birth cohort, as compared to the German school entry health examination statistics in 2017. Simulated vaccination protection rates for each federal state ranged from 10% in Hamburg to 51% in Baden-Wuerttemberg. Conclusions: While there was an overall low vaccination uptake and a discrepancy between areas of high vs. low TBE risk, this study also indicates a concerning decline in vaccination compliance. Vaccinating physicians should address the importance of adherence upon initiation of TBE vaccination. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Betlach, AM; Fano, E; VanderWaal, K; Pieters, M				Betlach, Alyssa M.; Fano, Eduardo; VanderWaal, Kimberly; Pieters, Maria			Effect of multiple vaccinations on transmission and degree of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection in gilts	VACCINE			English	Article						Bacterial load; Replacement gilts; Transmission; Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae; Vaccination; VNTR typing	ENZOOTIC-PNEUMONIA; PIG HERDS; LUNG LESIONS; RISK-FACTORS; SWINE; COLONIZATION; SEROCONVERSION; REINFECTION; VARIABILITY; PROTOCOLS	Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae) infections continue to result in significant respiratory challenges in the swine industry worldwide. Vaccination for M. hyopneumoniae is commonly utilized, as reduction in bacterial loads and clinical severity in vaccinated pigs have been shown. However, the effect of M. hyopneumoniae vaccination on transmission across different pig populations has been minimally investigated. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of multiple vaccinations on M. hyopneumoniae infection, transmission, and genetic variability in infected and susceptible gilt populations. Thirty-two naive gilts were allocated to four treatment groups: (1) Vaccinated seeder (VS); (2) Non-vaccinated seeder (NVS); (3) Vaccinated contact (VC); and (4) Non-vaccinated contact (NVC). At 5, 7, and 9 weeks of age, all gilts selected to be vaccinated received a commercial M. hyopneumoniae bacterin for a total of 3 doses. At 11 weeks of age, VS and NVS gilts were inoculated with M. hyopneumoniae to become seeders. At 28 days post-inoculation (dpi), VS and NVS gilts were individually relocated to clean experimental rooms, where they were placed in contact with one age-matched VC or NVC gilt (1:1 ratio) for 14 days. Blood and tracheal samples, bronchial swabs, and lung lesions were collected and/or evaluated for M. hyopneumoniae infection. In this study, a three-dose vaccination strategy against M. hyopneumoniae significantly reduced bacterial load in seeder gilts. Furthermore, a numerical reduction in M. hyopneumoniae lung lesions at 28 dpi was observed in VS gilts. All VC gilts in the VS:VC treatment group pairing remained M. hyopneumoniae negative, compared to other groups in which 1-2 transmission events occurred per treatment group. Results from this investigation provide insight on the potential impact of multiple vaccinations on reducing M. hyopneumoniae transmission and infection. Further research encompassing vaccinations of gilt groups in field settings is necessary to validate findings. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To support the expansion of its mandate to include considerations for vaccine acceptability when making recommendations, the NACI Secretariat developed a matrix of factors that influence acceptability. To inform and validate the matrix, we systematically reviewed evidence for factors that influence vaccine acceptability, and for interventions aimed at improving acceptability. Methods: On 10-11 October 2018 we searched four bibliographic databases, the Theses Canada Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Two reviewers agreed on the included studies. From each study, we extracted information about the participants, intervention or exposure, comparator, and relevant outcomes. Due to heterogeneity in the reported factors and acceptability indicators we synthesized the findings narratively. We appraised the certainty of evidence using GRADE. For each vaccine-preventable disease we populated a matrix of factors for which there was evidence of an influence on acceptability. Results: One hundred studies (>1 million participants) contributed data relevant to the public, 16 (6191 participants) to healthcare providers, and three (84 participants) to policymakers. There were 43 intervention studies (similar to 2 million participants). Across vaccines, we identified low certainty evidence for 70 factors relevant to the general population, 56 to high-risk groups, and 30 to healthcare providers. The perceived safety and importance of the vaccine, vaccination history, and receiving a recommendation from a healthcare provider were common influential factors. We found low certainty evidence that reminders for childhood vaccines and policies or delivery models for rotavirus vaccines could improve uptake and coverage. Evidence for other interventions was of very low certainty. Conclusions: The NACI vaccine acceptability matrix is useful for categorizing acceptability factors for the general public. Reminder systems may improve the uptake of childhood vaccines. Policies that make the rotavirus vaccine universally available and easily accessible may improve coverage.

J	Llau, AF; Williams, ML; Tejada, CE				Llau, Anthoni F.; Williams, Mark L.; Tejada, Carlos Espinal			National vaccine coverage trends and funding in Latin America and the Caribbean	VACCINE			English	Article						Coverage; Funding; Latin America and the Caribbean; Rates	UNITED-STATES; CHILDREN	Background: From 2006 to 2011 nearly 174,000 deaths were prevented in Latin America and the Caribbean through vaccination of children under five, which is widely attributed to the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). Despite near global adoption of EPI recommendations, vaccination coverage shows substantial variation across world regions. Causes for low immunizations within regions are multifaceted and include vaccination program costs. To date, publications regarding vaccine coverage across Latin America and the Caribbean are not readily available. This study aimed to: (1) compare vaccine coverage trends across nations within the region; and (2) assess whether national immunization program expenditures are correlated with vaccine coverage. Methods: Coverage for nine vaccines were collected by nation using publicly available data from WHO. National immunization program expenditures for each country were collected from the World Bank Index. The proportion of countries achieving 90% coverage in the years 2013 and 2017 for each vaccine were compared. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the relationship between financing variables and DTP3 coverage for 2017. Results: In 2017, fewer Latin American and Caribbean nations were able to achieve 90% vaccine coverage for five vaccines compared to 2013. Mostly weak to moderate positive relationships were found between national immunization program expenditures and DTP3 coverage for 2017. Excluding Haiti, a weak negative relationship was found between total government expenditure on vaccines per infant and DTP3 coverage for 2017. Countries across Latin America and the Caribbean were largely self-reliant in funding vaccine expenditures. Conclusions: Fewer countries across Latin America and the Caribbean are currently achieving optimum national vaccine coverage and weak to moderate relationships between routine immunization and vaccine expenditures and coverage were observed. Additional factors contributing to national vaccine coverage should be concomitantly examined to implement strategies which optimize delivery of childhood immunizations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, the number of pertussis cases is increasing in elementary school children aged 6-12 years. Therefore, a test-negative case-control study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the pertussis vaccine program. Methods: Subjects included children aged >= 3 months who visited a collaborating hospital due to pertussis-specific cough between October 2017 and November 2019. All subjects underwent diagnostic tests for pertussis, and those diagnosed as positive were regarded as cases. Subjects diagnosed as pertussis-negative were classified as controls. Vaccination history was collected using a questionnaire administered to parents with reference to immunization records. Logistic regression models were employed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval for laboratory-confirmed pertussis. Results: Of 187 recruited subjects (120 cases and 67 controls), questionnaire responses were obtained for 145 subjects (95 cases and 50 controls). Compared with unvaccinated subjects, the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 4 doses was 70% among all subjects and reached to 90% with marginal significance among subjects under 6 years of age. However, among school-aged subjects, the VE was not suggestive of protection against pertussis (VE: 8%). For vaccinees given 4 doses, the OR for developing pertussis increased significantly with longer duration since the fourth dose (compared with <4.5 years, OR of 6.0-8.2 years = 5.74; OR of >8.3 years = 3.88; P for trend by duration < 0.01). Conclusion: Effectiveness of administering 4 doses of pertussis vaccine during infancy decreases with time passed since the fourth dose. This regimen does not protect school-aged children against pertussis. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we aimed to examine inequalities in child vaccination coverage in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We analysed Demographic and Health Survey data in 25 sub-Saharan African countries. We defined full vaccination coverage as a child who received one dose of bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG), three doses of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus vaccine (DTP 3), three oral polio vaccine doses (OPV 3), and one dose of measles vaccine. We used the concentration index (CCI) to measure wealthrelated inequality in full vaccination, incomplete vaccination, and zero-dose children within and between countries. We fitted a multilevel regression model to identify predictors of inequality in receipts of full vaccination. Results: Overall, 56.5% (95% CI: 55.7% to 57.3%) of children received full vaccination, 35.1% (34.4% to 35.7%) had incomplete vaccination, while 8.4% (95% CI: 8.0% to 8.8%) of children remained unvaccinated. Full vaccination coverage across the 25 sub-Saharan African countries ranged from 24% in Guinea to 93% in Rwanda. We found pro-rich inequality in full vaccination coverage in 23 countries, except for Gambia and Namibia, where we found pro-poor vaccination coverage. Countries with lower vaccination coverage had higher inequalities suggesting pro-rich coverage, while inequality in unvaccinated children was disproportionately concentrated among disadvantaged subgroups. Four or more antenatal care contracts, childbirth at health facility, improved maternal education, higher household wealth, and frequently listening to the radio increased vaccine uptake. Conclusions: Continued efforts to improve access to vaccination services are required in sub-Saharan Africa. Improving vaccination coverage and reducing inequalities requires enhancing access to quality services that are accessible, affordable, and acceptable to all. Vaccination programs should target critical social determinants of health and address barriers to better maternal health-seeking behaviour. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) previous policy stated that all vaccines had opened for immu-nization session had to be discarded at the end of the session, regardless to the type of the vaccine or the number of doses remaining in the vial. To bring wastage rate down, the WHO multi-dose vial policy (MDVP) was introduced. It stated that multi dose liquid vaccine vials, from which one or more doses have been administered, may be used for subsequent immunization session up to 28 days in the recommended manufacture storage conditions provided that certain condition must be met. The EPI in Egypt had adopted the MDVP in 2016. The current study aimed to evaluate the impact of implementation MDVP on vaccine wastage rate in Alexandria, and to estimate the cost reduction after that policy. Methods: Information regarding to vaccine doses consumed and children vaccinated were retrieved from medical districts and primary health care units for the period from January 1st 2014 to October 31st 2018. Interrupted time series design with control was conducted to determine the level change and trend change for the policy vaccines and for estimating the average cost saved after the policy. Results: The adoption of MDVP led to a significant reduction in the wastage rates of Pentavalent vaccine by 84.7%, DPT vaccine by 82.5% and OPV by 32%. Thus, by implementation of MDVP the estimated annual cost saved for the policy vaccine in all Egypt could be USD 2,449, 079 eth 95%CI 826, 076 to 12, 219, 869 THORN . Conclusion: The implementation of MDVP in Alexandria made a significant reduction in the vaccine wastage rate which led to a saving in vaccine requirement and by consequence a cost saved.

Since then, BCG vaccination is used globally for protection against childhood and disseminated TB; however, its efficacy at protecting against pulmonary TB in adult and aging populations is highly variable. Due to the BCG generated immunity, this vaccine later proved to have an antitumor activity; though the standing mechanisms behind are still unclear. Recent studies indicate that both innate and adaptive cell responses may play an important role in BCG eradication and prevention of bladder cancer. Thus, cells such as natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils but also MHC-restricted CD4 and CD8 T cells and y6 T cells may play an important role and can be one the main effectors in BCG therapy. Here, we discuss the role of BCG therapy in bladder cancer and other cancers, including current strategies and their impact on the generation and sustainability of protective antitumor immunity against bladder cancer.

BCG-induced Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) reactions have also been associated with reduced all-cause mortality. We aimed to assess the association between TST responses and subsequent mortality in three birth cohorts and conducted a meta-analysis of existing studies. Methods: Observational study within three Guinea-Bissau BCG trial birth cohorts (conducted 2002-04, 2009-2013 and 2014-18) that encompassed children who were BCG-vaccinated within 28 days with TSTs performed at 2-(n = 1389) and 6-months (n = 2635) of age. We evaluated TST reaction determinants by binomial regression and assessed the association between TSTs > 1 mm (reactors) vs. < 1 mm (nonreactors) and subsequent mortality risk up to age 12 months in Cox-models providing Mortality Rate Ratios (MRRs). We searched PubMed for studies to calculate meta-estimates of the association between TST reactivity by age 2-and 6-months and all-cause mortality. Results: Large post-vaccination wheal size was associated with 6-month TST positivity and so was receiving BCG-Denmark or BCG-Japan, compared with BCG-Russia. By age 2 months, 22% (302/1389) of infants were TST reactors with a 2-12-month mortality risk of 1.7% (5/302) vs. 3.3% (36/1087) for non-reactors, the corresponding reactor/non-reactor MRR = 0.49 (0.19-1.26). By age 6 months, 44% (1149/2635) of infants were reactors and the 6-12-month mortality risk was 0.4% (4/1149) vs. 0.6% (9/1486) for nonreactors, the MRR = 0.87 (0.27-2.86). The literature search provided 3 studies. The meta-analysis revealed a uniform pattern of reduced mortality associated with TST reactivity, a TST response by 2 months being associated with an MRR of 0.59 (0.39-0.90); for 6-month TST responses the MRR was 0.65 (0.43-1.00). Conclusion: Among BCG-vaccinated infants, TST reactions were associated with markedly reduced mortality. Improved vaccination technique and using certain BCG strains could lead to a higher TST reaction prevalence, which would enhance BCG's beneficial non-specific effects. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

It may be the most widely used vaccine in human history and is the only licensed human tuberculosis (TB) vaccine avail-able. Despite its excellent safety history, a century of use in global vaccination programs, and its significant contribution to reducing TB mortality among children, the efficacy of BCG continues to be disputed due to its incomplete protection against pulmonary TB in adults. Still vaccines offer the best chance to contain the ongoing spread of multi-drug resistance TB and disease dissemination. The development of improved vac-cines against TB therefore remains a high global priority. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that genet-ically modified BCG, or administration of existing BCG through alternate routes, or revaccination, offers improved protection, suggesting that BCG is well poised to make a comeback. Intravesical BCG is also the only approved microbial immunotherapy for any form of cancer, and is the first-line therapy for treatment-naive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMBIC), which represents a majority of the new bladder cancer cases diagnosed. However, almost a third of patients with NMIBC are either BCG unresponsive or have tumor recurrence, leading to a higher risk of disease progression. With very few advances in intravesical therapy over the past two decades for early-stage disease, and a limited pipeline of therapeutics in Phase 3 or late Phase 2 development, there is a major unmet need for improved intravesical therapies for NMIBC. Indeed, genetically modified candidate BCG vaccines engineered to express molecules that confer stronger protection against pulmonary TB or induce potent anti-tumor immunity in NMIBC have shown promise in both pre-clinical and clinical settings. This review discusses the development of second generation, genetically modified BCG candidates as TB vaccines and as anti-tumor adjuvant therapy for NMIBC. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Serologic response to sequential vaccination with enhanced influenza vaccines: Open label randomized trial among adults aged 65-74 years	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza vaccine; Immunogenicity; Vaccine; High-Dose Trivalent Influenza Vaccine; Adjuvant	SEASONAL INFLUENZA; UNITED-STATES; IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES; ADVISORY-COMMITTEE; RECOMMENDATIONS; IMMUNOGENICITY; PREVENTION; EFFICACY; VIRUSES	Background: The effects of sequential vaccination with enhanced influenza vaccines are poorly under-stood. We conducted an exploratory open-label study to assess serologic response to sequential vaccina-tion in older adults. Methods: 160 adults aged 65 through 74 years were randomized (1:1:1) to receive trivalent inactivated standard dose (SD), high-dose (HD), or MF59-adjuvanted (AD) vaccine in 2016/17. In 2017/18, HD and AD recipients received the same vaccine; SD recipients were re-randomized to HD or AD. Hemagglutination inhibition assays were performed using turkey erythrocytes against A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-like and B/Brisbane/60/2008(B/Victoria)-like in both seasons, and A/Michigan/45/2015(H1N1)-like in season 2. Microneutralization assays were performed against cell-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2)-like using MDCK-SIAT1 cells. Postvaccination geometric mean titer (GMT), percent with titer > 40, and mean fold rise (MFR, ratio of postvaccination versus prevaccination titer) in season 2 were compared across groups, and ratio of MFR in season 2 versus season 1 was assessed for each strain. Results: Analysis included 152 participants (55 HD-. HD, 58 AD-. AD, 19 SD-. HD, and 20 SD-. AD). Season 2 postvaccination GMTs and percent with titer > 40 did not differ between HD-. HD and AD-. AD recipients for vaccine strains examined. However, a higher percent of HD-. HD and AD-. AD recipients had postvaccination titer > 40 than SD-. AD recipients for A/H1N1 (86%-89% versus 60%) and SD-. AD and SD-. HD recipients for A/H3N2 (83%-87% versus 40%-53%). GMTs were higher in AD-. AD versus SD-. AD recipients for A/H1N1 (p = .01) and A/H3N2 (p = .002). MFRs in season 2 were low in all groups for A/H3N2 (1.5-2.2) and B/Victoria (1.7-2.3). MFR was lower in season 2 versus 1 for HD-. HD and AD-. AD recipients for all vaccine strains (1.6-3.7 versus 2.6-6.2). Conclusions: Sequential vaccination with enhanced vaccines did not reduce immunogenicity in adults aged 65 through 74 years. Serologic response to cell-propagated A/H3N2 was suboptimal for all vaccines. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier. NCT02872311 (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As pandemic lockdowns end, temporal overlap of circulation of seasonal influenza viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is expected. Understanding the impact of influenza vaccination on risk of coronavirus infection is therefore of considerable public health importance. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized trial where children and adolescents in Canadian Hutterite colonies were randomly assigned by colony to receive the 2008-2009 seasonal inac-tivated trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) or a control hepatitis A (HepA) vaccine. All 3273 colony members (vaccinated children and nonvaccine recipients) were followed for the primary outcome of RT-PCR con-firmed seasonal coronavirus infection. Serum collected pre-and post-vaccination was analyzed for titers of IgG antibodies towards human coronaviruses (HCoV). Results: The incidence of coronavirus infection was 0.18/1000 person-days in the colonies that received TIV vs 0.36/1000 person-days in the control group, hazard ratio (HR) 0.49 [0.21-1.17]. The risk reduction among non-vaccine recipients in the TIV group compared to the control group was HR 0.55 [0.24-1.23]. There was an increase in the geometric mean fold change of HCoV-OC43 antibody titers following TIV compared to HepA vaccine (mean difference 1.2 [0.38-2.06], p = 0.007), and an increase in geometric mean HCoV-NL63 antibody titers post-TIV (262.9 vs 342.9, p = 0.03). Conclusion: The influenza vaccine does not increase the risk of a coronavirus infection. Instead, the influ-enza vaccine may reduce the rate of coronavirus infections by inducing cross-reactive anti-coronavirus IgG antibodies. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Health care waste is not effectively managed, especially in some developing countries. However, measles supplemental immunisation activities (SIAs) are used to strengthen routine immunisation system, including waste management. The waste management planning provides an opportunity to build capacity, mobilize resources and strengthen structures to ensure continual disposal of routine immunisation waste. Methods: We reviewed the Kebbi State and LGA routine immunisation waste management situation and identified existing gaps; developed and implemented the plan for waste management, including strengthening routine immunisation waste management. The process included, reactivation of measles technical coordination committee, mobilizing resources for funding, and sustenance of immunisation waste management. The health care workforce was trained in safe immunisation waste disposal practices. Results: Immunisation waste management committee and the structure was established and strengthened at the state and LGA levels and a total cost of 11,710.70 USD was expended on injection waste management, with an average cost per injection of 0.01 USD. A total of 11,829 safety boxes were incinerated in the state, including those generated from routine immunisation sessions. Twenty-one Local Immunisation Officers, 1097 and 2192 team supervisors and healthcare worker vaccinators respectively were trained on immunisation waste disposal. Conclusion: Immunisation waste management strategies protect healthcare workers and reduce the adverse impact on the environment. Improving key areas such as human and financial resources ensures accountability towards sustainable healthcare waste management. (C) 2021 World Health Organization. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Impact of the childhood influenza vaccine programme on antibiotic prescribing rates in primary care in England	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza vaccination; Live attenuated influenza vaccine; Antibiotic prescribing; Respiratory tract infections	SCHOOL-AGE-CHILDREN	Vaccines are a key part of the global strategy to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR) since prevention of infection should reduce antibiotic use. England commenced national rollout of a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) programme for children aged 2-3 years together with a series of geographically discrete pilot areas for primary school age children in 2013 extending to older children in subsequent seasons. We investigated vaccine programme impact on community antibiotic prescribing rates. Antibiotic prescribing incidence rates for respiratory (RTI) and urinary tract infections (UTI; controls) were calculated at general practice (GP) level by age category (children<=10 years/adults) and season for LAIV pilot and non-pilot areas between 2013/14 and 2015/16. To estimate the LAIV (primary school age children only) intervention effect, a random effects model was fitted. A multivariable random-effects Poisson regression investigated the association of antibiotic prescribing rates in children with LAIV uptake (2-3-year-olds only) at GP practice level. RTI antibiotic prescribing rates for children <=10 years and adults showed clear seasonal trends and were lower in LAIV-pilot and non-pilot areas after the introduction of the LAIV programme in 2013. The reductions for RTI prescriptions (children) were similar (within 3%) in all areas, which coincided with the start the UK AMR strategy. Antibiotic prescribing was significantly (p < 0.0001) related to LAIV uptake in 2-3-year-olds with antibiotic prescribing reduced by 2.7% (95% CI: 2.1% to 3.4%) for every 10% increase in uptake. We found no evidence the LAIV programme for primary school age children resulted in reductions in RTI antibiotic prescribing, however we detected a significant inverse association between increased vaccine uptake in pre-school age children and antibiotic prescribing at GP level.

V114 016 PNEU PATH Study Grp	Safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114, a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, followed by sequential PPSV23 vaccination in healthy adults aged >= 50 years: A randomized phase III trial (PNEU-PATH)	VACCINE			English	Article						Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; Sequential vaccination; Safety; Immunogenicity; Pneumococcal disease	POLYSACCHARIDE VACCINE; ADVISORY-COMMITTEE; IMMUNIZATION; RECOMMENDATIONS; PNEUMONIA; DISEASE	Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae causes pneumococcal disease, and older adults are at an increased risk. Sequential vaccination of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended for broad protection against pneumococcal disease in some countries. Methods: This phase III trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of sequential administration of either V114 (a 15-valent PCV containing serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F) or PCV13, followed 12 months later by PPSV23, in healthy adults aged >50 years (NCT03480763). A total of 652 participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either V114 or PCV13, followed by PPSV23. Results: The most common solicited adverse events (AEs) following PCV vaccination included injection-site pain and fatigue. Higher proportions of participants with these events were observed in the V114 group following PCV; however, these differences were not clinically significant. Following PPSV23 vaccination, the most common solicited AEs were injection-site pain and injection-site swelling; the proportions of participants with these events were comparable between both groups. Incidence of serious AEs was low in both groups following PCV and PPSV23, and none were related to study vaccines. No deaths occurred during the study. Serum opsonophagocytic activity geometric mean titers and immunoglobulin G geometric mean concentrations were comparable between both groups for all 15 serotypes in V114 following PPSV23. Immune responses elicited by V114 persisted for at least 12 months. Immune responses at 30 days and 12 months post-vaccination with PCV were comparable between both groups for the 13 shared serotypes and higher in the V114 group for the V114-unique serotypes (22F and 33F). Conclusion: Administration of V114 followed by PPSV23 was well tolerated and induced comparable antibody levels to PCV13 followed by PPSV23 in healthy adults aged >50 years. (c) 2021 The Authors.

J	Eberhardt, J; Ling, J				Eberhardt, Judith; Ling, Jonathan			Predicting COVID-19 vaccination intention using protection motivation theory and conspiracy beliefs	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Vaccination hesitancy; Conspiracy theories; Protection Motivation Theory		Background: While COVID-19 vaccine uptake has been encouraging overall, some individuals are either hesitant towards, or refuse, the vaccine. Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) has been applied to influenza vaccine acceptance, but there is a lack of research applying PMT to COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Additionally, prior research has suggested that coronavirus conspiracy beliefs and demographic factors may play a role in attitudes towards the vaccine. This study aimed to predict COVID-19 vaccination intention using PMT, coronavirus conspiracy beliefs, and demographic factors. Furthermore, vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were compared in relation to their coronavirus conspiracy beliefs. Methods: An online survey was administered to 382 (278 vaccinated, and 104 unvaccinated) individuals in the United Kingdom (77 males, 301 females, one non-binary/third gender, and three unstated). Respondents' mean age was 43.78 (SD = 12.58). Results: A hierarchical multiple linear regression was performed in three stages. Initially, four PMT constructs severity, susceptibility, maladaptive response costs, and self-efficacy emerged as significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccination intention. The final model accounted for 75% of the variance and retained two significant predictors from PMT maladaptive response rewards and self-efficacy- along-side coronavirus conspiracy beliefs and age. An independent t-test established that unvaccinated individuals held greater coronavirus conspiracy beliefs than vaccinated ones. Conclusions: Interventions and campaigns addressing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance should employ strategies increasing individuals' perceived severity of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility, and perceived ability to get vaccinated, while decreasing perceived rewards of not getting vaccinated. Additionally, coronavirus conspiracy beliefs should be addressed, as these appear to play a role for some vaccine hesitant individuals. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Initially, a Korean commercial vaccine against the Y280 and Y439 lineages of H9N2 was evaluated for use in SPF chickens. A single vaccination did not protect chickens against virus of the Y280 lineage, with no significant reduction in virus shedding and a 37.5% inhibition in virus recovery rate in cecal tonsil. rgHS314 was selected as a vaccine candidate, showing immunogenicity in SPF chickens, and was highly productive in eggs. Moreover, rgHS314 protected with high levels of protective immunity and significantly reduced virus shedding, with 100% and 83.3% inhibition of virus recovery in the cecal tonsil against homologous and heterologous challenge viruses, respectively. Taken together, these data suggest that a single vaccination with this recombinant vaccine candidate could elicit cross-reactive immune responses capable of protecting chickens against H9N2 viruses of the Y439 and Y280 lineages (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

With higher levels of severe outcomes in these groups, equitable vaccination coverage should be prioritised. The aim of this study was to identify inequalities in coverage of COVID-19 vaccination in Wales, UK and to highlight areas which may benefit from routine enhanced surveillance and targeted interventions. Records within the Wales Immunisation System (WIS) population register were linked to the Welsh Demographic Service Dataset (WDSD) and central list of shielding patients, held within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Ethnic group was derived from the 2011 census and over 20 administrative electronic health record (EHR) data sources. Uptake of first dose of any COVID19 vaccine was analysed over time, with the odds of being vaccinated as at 25th April 2021 by sex, health board of residence, rural/urban classification, deprivation quintile and ethnic group presented. Using logistic regression models, analyses were adjusted for age group, care home resident status, health and social care worker status and shielding status. This study included 1,256,412 individuals aged 50 years and over. Vaccine coverage increased steadily from 8th December 2020 until mid-April 2021. Overall uptake of first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in this group was 92.1%. After adjustment the odds of being vaccinated were lower for individuals who were male, resident in the most deprived areas, resident in an urban area and an ethnic group other than White. The largest inequality was seen between ethnic groups, with the odds of being vaccinated 0.22 (95 %CI 0.21-0.24) if in any Black ethnic group compared to any White ethnic group. Ongoing monitoring of inequity in uptake of vaccinations is required, with better targeted interventions and engagement with deprived and ethnic communities to improve vaccination uptake.

Cross-sectional analysis of a UK national cohort study	VACCINE			English	Article						Young women; HPV; Vaccination; Inequalities; Disparities; Initiation	INEQUALITIES; PROGRAM; ENGLAND	Objectives: HPV vaccination is highly effective in preventing HPV-associated disease, including cervical cancer, which disproportionately affects women from disadvantaged and minority ethnic backgrounds. We examined inequalities in initiation of the HPV vaccination schedule among young women in the UK and reasons given by their parents for non-initiation. Design: Cross sectional analyses of a prospective nationally representative cohort study. Setting: Four UK countries. Participants: 5,695 young women (39.9% from households in lowest income quintiles, 5.1% ever excluded from school, 0.5% not attending school) whose parents (14.3% from minority ethnic backgrounds; 54.1% with no stated religious faith) took part in interviews conducted when their daughters were 14 years old. Main outcome measures: Parent-reported initiation of HPV vaccination and reasons for non-initiation. The adjusted odds (aORs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) of initiating HPV vaccination were estimated using logistic regression after mutual adjustment for household income, school exclusion, school atten-dance and parental ethnic background and religious faith. Results: 92.3% (5265) had initiated HPV vaccination at time of interview. Initiation was less likely among those living in the poorest households (aOR; 95% CI: 0.44; 0.30 to 0.64 for those in lowest household income quintile), who did not attend school (0.11; 0.04 to 0.33), had ever been excluded from school (0.47; 0.29 to 0.76), or whose parents were from Black African (0.49; 0.26 to 0.95) or Any Other (0.34; 0.17 to 0.66) ethnic backgrounds. A reason consistent with a conscious or practical decision was reported by 53.3% (219) and 24.1% (90) parents respectively. Conclusions: Although most young women are immunised, marked social inequalities in access to HPV vaccination initiation remain. Practical steps to address this are possible and should be implemented to reduce inequalities in primary prevention of cancers and to ensure equitable access to this important public health intervention.

'My primary purpose is to protect the unborn child': Understanding pregnant women's perceptions of maternal vaccination and vaccine trials in Europe	VACCINE			English	Article						Maternal vaccination; Vaccine trial; Vaccine confidence; Trust; Decision-making; Risk perception	INFLUENZA; ATTITUDES; PARTICIPATION	Despite the important benefits of maternal vaccination for pregnant women and newborns, vaccination uptake is low in many European countries. Differences in vaccination policies and recommendations, as well as concerns about vaccine safety can partly explain inadequate coverage rates and women's hesi-tancy to get vaccinated during pregnancy. This study aims to explore pregnant women's experiences, decision-making processes and perceptions towards maternal vaccination and maternal vaccine trials in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted with 258 pregnant women identified through local research panels and snowballing. Topic guides translated in local languages were designed to explore women's awareness and perceptions of maternal vaccination, and willingness to participate in vaccine trials during pregnancy. A thematic anal-ysis was conducted. Pregnant women were found to have low awareness about maternal vaccination, with many reporting not having received a recommendation to vaccinate from their doctors. Strong trust in health professionals indicate that strengthened recommendations could improve vaccination uptake. Vaccination decision-making in pregnancy was described in the context of a highly emotional period, generating anxiety and fears around the safety of vaccines. Pregnancy was also discussed as a period dur -ing which women develop nurturing and protective identities. However, depending on the information they received as well as influences from experts, families and peers, women either perceived vaccination as a threat to their babies' safety or as a means to protect them. Attitudes towards maternal vaccine trials were less ambiguous, with most pregnant women strongly rejecting the notion of taking part in trials. While strategies to improve pregnant women's awareness and perceptions of maternal vaccination are needed, it is equally important to understand why healthcare professionals may not be recommending vaccination. More coordinated strategies across Europe could help strengthen communication and trust in maternal vaccination. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The knowledge base to inform recommendations for optimization of VMA is lacking. We therefore conducted a comprehensive evaluation of EU VMA pathways. Methods: Research in two phases included: (1) mapping VMA pathways in each EU member state (including the UK) based on a literature review, expert interviews, and mathematical archetyping; and (2) interviews with vaccine experts to identify barriers, drivers, and recommendations for regional VMA alignments. Results: Key steps in VMA across the EU include horizon scanning, early advice, National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) recommendation for inclusion in national immunization programs, health technology assessment (HTA), final decision and procurement. We found significant complexity and heterogeneity, particularly for early advice, and in the roles, decision-making criteria, and transparency of NITAGs and HTA bodies. The most important drivers for rapid VMA included demonstration of disease burden and vaccine benefit (e.g., efficacy, safety, economic). Key barriers were budget limitations and complexity/clarity of VMA processes (e.g., need for national-regional consensus, clarity on process initiation, and clarity on the role of HTA). Recommendations for alignment at EU and member-state levels include information sharing, joint clinical assessment, initiatives to address funding and political barriers, and improved transparency by decision-making bodies. Early engagement with vaccine stakeholders was a key recommendation for manufacturers. Conclusions: There is significant potential for alignment, collaboration, and improvement of VMA across the EU. Roles, responsibilities, and transparency of key bodies can be clarified. The COVID-19 pandemic response should stimulate policies to improve access to all vaccines, including routine ones, and form the foundation upon which a consistent vaccine ecosystem can be created for the EU, one that is resilient, consistent between member states, and fit for purpose.

Measles infection in persons with secondary vaccine failure, New York City, 2018-19	VACCINE			English	Article						Measles; Vaccine failure; Avidity; Transmission; Waning immunity	VIRUS; ANTIBODIES; OUTBREAK; IMMUNITY; GENE	A large measles outbreak in New York City, which included cases among vaccinated persons and adults presumed to be immune, provided the opportunity to better understand vaccine failure and the potential impact on measles transmission. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity can distinguish primary (low avidity IgG, indicating no evidence of prior immunity) versus secondary vaccine failure (high avidity IgG, indicating prior immune response and waning antibody). Measles IgG avidity was measured on samples from 62 persons: avidity was high in 53 (16 vaccinated and 37 with unknown vaccination history) and low in 9 (1 recently vaccinated and 8 with unknown vaccination history). Secondary transmission from 2 persons with high-avidity IgG results occurred. These findings illustrate that in settings of sustained measles elimination, measles infection and transmission can occur in persons with secondary vaccine failure, underscoring the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for measles during an outbreak despite prior or presumed prior vaccination.

Vaccine efficacy is highly sensitive to antigenic changes causing differences between circulating and vaccine viruses. Adjuvants such as MF59 increase antibody-mediated cross-reactive immunity and therefore may provide broader seasonal protection. A recent clinical trial showed that an MF59-adjuvanted vaccine was more efficacious than a nonadjuvanted comparator in subjects < 2 years of age, although not in those > 2 years, during influenza seasons in which the predom-inant circulating virus was an A/H3N2 strain that was antigenically different from the vaccine virus. This finding suggested that the increased efficacy of the adjuvanted vaccine in younger subjects may be medi-ated by strain cross-reactive antibodies. A subset of the trial population, representing subjects with dis-tinct age and/or immunological history, was tested for antibody responses to the vaccine A/H3N2 strain as well as A/H3N2 drifted strains antigenically matching the viruses circulating during the trial seasons. The neutralizing tests showed that, compared with nonadjuvanted vaccine, the adjuvanted vaccine improved not only the neutralizing antibody response to the vaccine strain but also the cross-reactive antibody response to the drifted strains in subjects with lower preexisting antibody titers, regardless of their age or vaccine history. The results demonstrated an immunological benefit and suggested a potential efficacy benefit by adjuvanted vaccine in subjects with lower preexisting antibody responses. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Transfer of protective antibodies between mothers and offspring should occur after vaccination of mice. We present new evidence for maternal transfer of oral vaccine induced neutralizing anti-OspA IgG antibodies to mouse pups mainly through ingestion of colostrum. We found a strong statistical correlation of antibody transfer between mothers that produced the most robust IgG response to OspA and their respective pups. OspA-specific antibody was detected as early as 24 h after birth and protective levels of antibodies lasted until similar to 5 weeks of age in the majority of pups but persisted in some mice until 9 weeks. This was further supported by detection of neutralizing antibodies in serum of all pups at 2-3 weeks after birth and in some offspring adult mice at 9 weeks of age. A clear association was found between robust antibody responses in mothers and the length of time antibody persisted in the respective pups using a novel longitudinal Bayesian model. These factors are likely to impact the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi if reservoir targeted OspA-based vaccination interventions are implemented. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Is further research on adult pneumococcal vaccine uptake improvement programs worthwhile? A value of information analysis	VACCINE			English	Article						Adult pneumococcal vaccination; Value of information analysis; Cost-effectiveness analysis	COST-EFFECTIVENESS	Background: Pneumococcal vaccination policy for US adults is evolving, but previous research has shown that programs to increase vaccine uptake are economically favorable, despite parameter uncertainty. Using value of information (VOI) analysis and prior analyses, we examine the value of further research on vaccine uptake program parameters. Methods: In US 50-64-year-olds, current vaccine recommendations with and without an uptake program were analyzed. In older adults, current recommendations and an alternative strategy (polysaccharide vaccine for all, adding conjugate vaccine only for the immunocompromised) with and without uptake programs were examined. Uptake program parameters were derived from a clinical trial (absolute uptake increase 12.3% [range 0-25%], per-person cost $1.78 [range $0.70-$2.26]), with other parameters obtained from US databases. VOI analyses incorporated probabilistic sensitivity analysis outputs into R-based regression techniques. Results: In 50-64-year-olds, an uptake program cost $54,900/QALY gained compared to no uptake program. For ages >= 65, the program cost $287,000/QALY gained with the alternative strategy and $765,000/QALY with current recommendations. In younger adults, population-level expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was $59.7 million at $50,000/QALY gained and $2.8 million at $100,000/QALY gained. In older adults, EVPI values ranged from similar to$1 million to $34.5 million at $100,000 and $200,000/QALY thresholds. The population expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) for combined uptake program cost and uptake improvement parameters in the younger population was $368,700 at $50,000/QALY and $43,900 at $100,000/QALY gained thresholds. In older adults, population EVPPI for vaccine uptake program parameters was $0 at both thresholds, reaching a maximum value of $445,000 at a $225,000/QALY threshold. Other model parameters comprised larger components of the global EVPI. Conclusion: VOI results do not support further research on pneumococcal vaccine uptake programs in adults at commonly cited US cost-effectiveness benchmarks. Further research to reduce uncertainty in other aspects of adult pneumococcal vaccination is justifiable. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Patients with diabetes are at greater risk of HBV infection than healthy people. The immunogenicity and safety of two major hepatitis B vaccines were evaluated in Chinese patients with diabetes. Methods: In this phase IV, open-label, randomized, controlled study, participants with diabetes were randomly recruited from 6 township health centers in Gansu Province and received either a 3-dose Saccharomyces cerevisiae recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Group D20SC 0-1-6, n = 113) or a 3-dose Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO) recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Group D20CHO 0-1-6, n = 119). Healthy control groups were randomly recruited from the same 6 health centers and received 3 doses of the saccharomyces cerevisiae recombinant hepatitis B vaccine (Group ND20SC 0-1-6, n = 77). Immunogenicity, including seroconversion rate and geometric mean concentration (GMC) at 1 month after three doses of vaccination, and safety were assessed. The seroconversion rate was defined as the concentration of HBsAb > 10 mIU/mL. Results: The seroconversion rates of Group D20SC 0-1-6, Group D20CHO 0-1-6 and Group ND20SC 0-1-6 were 89.6%, 91.4% and 97.1%, respectively, in the per-protocol analysis, and these differences were not statistically significant. The antibody concentration in Group D20SC 0-1-6 (GMC = 601 mIU/mL) was lower than that of the healthy control group (GMC = 1465 mIU/mL), but no significant difference was found in the GMC between the Group D20CHO 0-1-6 (GMC = 778 mIU/mL) and Group D20SC 0-1-6. Adverse events (AEs) were comparable between groups, and no serious AEs were found in these three groups. Conclusions: The Saccharomyces cerevisiae recombinant and CHO recombinant hepatitis B vaccines in China can induce good immunogenicity in a diabetic population, although the antibody concentration may be lower, indicating the feasibility of vaccinating a large number of diabetic patients in China with these vaccines.

New tools are needed to achieve public health goals in malaria control and elimination. A first generation vaccine, RTS,S/AS01, is currently being evaluated as it undergoes pilot implementation through routine health systems in parts of three African countries. The development of this vaccine took over 30 years and has been full of uncertainties. Even now, important unknowns remain as to its future role in public health. Lessons need to be learnt for second generation and future vaccines, including how to facilitate early planning of investments, streamlining of development, regulatory and policy pathways. A number of candidate vaccines populate the current development pipeline, some of which have the potential to contribute to burden reduction if efficacy is confirmed in conditions of natural exposure, and if they are amenable to affordable supply and programmatic implementation. New, innovative technologies will be needed if future malaria vaccines are to overcome important scientific hurdles and induce durable, high level protection. WHO convened a stakeholder consultation on the status of malaria vaccine research and development to inform the recently reconstituted Malaria Vaccine Advisory Committee (MALVAC) which will assist WHO in updating its current guidance and recommendations about priorities and product preferences for malaria vaccines.

We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 8 sites in the USA, in healthy adults aged >18 years with no known history or risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had not previously received an investigational CoV vaccine or treatment. Participants were stratified into two age cohorts (>18-<55 and >55) and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either 50 or 100 mg of mRNA-1273, or placebo administered as two intramuscular injections 28 days apart. The primary outcomes were safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity assessed by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike binding antibody level (bAb). Secondary outcome was immunogenicity assessed by SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (nAb) response. Results: Between 29 May and 8 July 2020, 600 participants were randomized, 300 per age cohort. The most common solicited adverse reactions were pain at injection site, headache, and fatigue following each vaccination in both age cohorts. One serious adverse event deemed unrelated by the site investiga-tor occurred 33 days post-vaccination one. mRNA-1273 induced bAb and nAb by 28 days post-vaccination one that were higher at the 100 mg dose relative to the 50 mg dose; this difference was less apparent post-vaccination two. Binding antibodies and nAb increased substantially by 14 days following the second vaccination (day 43) to levels exceeding those of convalescent sera and remained elevated through day 57. Conclusions: Vaccination with mRNA-1273 resulted in significant immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in participants 18 years and older, with an acceptable safety profile, confirming the safety and immuno-genicity of 50 and 100 mg mRNA-1273 given as a 2 dose-regimen.

J	Artenstein, AW				Artenstein, Andrew W.			A half-century of meningococcal vaccines	VACCINE			English	Article						Meningococcal polysaccharide; Conjugate vaccines		The first safe and effective vaccine for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease was created fifty years ago. The vaccine employed a novel platform, polysaccharide capsular antigen, based on the discovery that anticapsular antibody conferred protective immunity in humans. As with most new paradigms in vaccinology, it derived from important basic research from other scientific disciplines over the preceding years. The success of the first monovalent polysaccharide vaccine in nearly eliminating invasive meningococcal disease in military settings led to accelerated advances in polysaccharide vaccine development against other serogroups of meningococcus and other encapsulated pathogens. As gaps in vaccine efficacy arose over the past half-century, new vaccine technologies and approaches were developed to address the challenges. Several of these, including conjugate vaccines and "reverse vaccinology" led to other novel, successful vaccines that have had a significant, favorable global impact on invasive meningococcal disease. The history of meningococcal vaccine discovery may provide insights into the future of vaccine efforts against other infectious threats. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Some of these broader consequences include cardiovascular events, exacerbations of chronic underlying conditions, increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, functional decline, and poor pregnancy outcomes, all of which may lead to an increased risk for hospitalization and death. Although it is methodologically difficult to measure these impacts, epidemiological and interventional study designs have evolved over recent decades to better take them into account. Recognizing these broader consequences of influenza virus infection is essential to determine the full burden of influenza among different subpopulations and the value of preventive approaches. In this review, we outline the main influenza complications and societal impacts beyond the classical respiratory symptoms of the disease. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Following successful preclinical studies with mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP), we tested an mRNA-LNP formulation (CV7202). Methods: In this phase 1, multi-center, controlled study in Belgium and Germany we enrolled 55 healthy 18-40-year-olds to receive intramuscular injections of 5 mu g (n = 10), 1 mu g (n = 16), or 2 mu g (n = 16) CV7202 on Day 1; subsets (n = 8) of 1 mu g and 2 mu g groups received second doses on Day 29. Controls (n = 10) received rabies vaccine, Rabipur, on Days 1, 8 and 29. Safety and reactogenicity were assessed up to 28 days post-vaccination using diary cards; immunogenicity was measured as RABV-G-specific neutralizing titers (VNT) by RFFIT and IgG by ELISA. Results: As initially tested doses of 5 mu g CV7202 elicited unacceptably high reactogenicity we subsequently tested 1 and 2 mu g doses which were better tolerated. No vaccine-related serious adverse events or withdrawals occurred. Low, dose-dependent VNT responses were detectable from Day 15 and by Day 29%, 31% and 22% of 1, 2 and 5 mu g groups, respectively, had VNTs >= 0.5 IU/mL, considered an adequate response by the WHO. After two 1 or 2 mu g doses all recipients had titers >= 0.5 IU/mL by Day 43. Day 57 GMTs were not significantly lower than those with Rabipur, which elicited adequate responses in all vaccinees after two doses. CV7202-elicited VNT were significantly correlated with RABV-G-specific IgG antibodies (r( )(2)= 0.8319, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Two 1 mu g or 2 mu g doses of CV7202 were well tolerated and elicited rabies neutralizing antibody responses that met WHO criteria in all recipients, but 5 mu g had unacceptable reactogenicity for a prophylactic vaccine.

An efficacious and affordable vaccine is urgently needed. The Va1308 - Gly548 of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 linked with Gln830 - Glu843 of Tetanus toxoid (TT peptide) (designated as S1-4) and without TT peptide (designated as S1-5) were expressed and renatured. The antigenicity and immunogenicity of S1-4 were evaluated by Western Blotting (WB) in vitro and immune responses in mice, respectively. The protective efficiency was measured preliminarily by microneutralization assay (MN50). The soluble S1-4 and S1-5 protein was prepared to high homogeneity and purity. Adjuvanted with Alum, S1-4 protein stimulated a strong antibody response in immunized mice and caused a major Th2-type cellular immunity supplemented with Th1-type immunity. Furthermore, the immunized sera could protect the Vero E6 cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection with neutralizing antibody titer 256. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a built in T helper epitope could stimulate both strong humoral immunity supplemented with cellular immunity in mice, demonstrating that it could be a promising subunit vaccine candidate.

Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine based on the health belief model: A population-based survey in Hong Kong	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Vaccine; Acceptance; Health belief model; Associated factors		Background: Vaccines for COVID-19 are anticipated to be available by 2021. Vaccine uptake rate is a crucial determinant for herd immunity. We examined factors associated with acceptance of vaccine based on (1). constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM), (2). trust in the healthcare system, new vaccine platforms and manufacturers, and (3). self-reported health outcomes. Methods: A population-based, random telephone survey was performed during the peak of the third wave of COVID-19 outbreak (27/07/2020 to 27/08/2020) in Hong Kong. All adults aged >= 18 years were eligible. The survey included sociodemographic details; self-report health conditions; trust scales; and self-reported health outcomes. Multivariable regression analyses were applied to examine independent associations. The primary outcome is the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: We conducted 1200 successful telephone interviews (response rate 55%). The overall vaccine acceptance rate after adjustment for population distribution was 37.2% (95% C.I. 34.5-39.9%). The projected acceptance rates exhibited a "J-shaped" pattern with age, with higher rates among young adults (18-24 years), then increased linearly with age. Multivariable regression analyses revealed that perceived severity, perceived benefits of the vaccine, cues to action, self-reported health outcomes, and trust in healthcare system or vaccine manufacturers were positive correlates of acceptance; whilst perceived access barriers and harm were negative correlates. Remarkably, perceived susceptibility to infection carried no significant association, whereas recommendation from Government (aOR = 10.2, 95% C.I. 6.54 to 15.9, p < 0.001) was as the strongest driving factor for acceptance. Other key obstacles of acceptance included lack of confidence on newer vaccine platforms (43.4%) and manufacturers without track record (52.2%), which are of particular relevance to the current context. Conclusions: Governmental recommendation is an important driver, whereas perceived susceptibility is not associated with acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. These HBM constructs and independent predictors inform evidence-based formulation and implementation of vaccination strategies. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Wong, Martin C.

Timing of COVID-19 vaccine approval and endorsement by public figures	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Vaccine hesitancy; Endorsements; Politicization		The global spread of COVID-19 has created an urgent need for a safe and effective vaccine. However, in the United States, the politicization of the vaccine approval process, including which public figures are endorsing it, could undermine beliefs about its safety and efficacy and willingness to receive it. Using a pair of randomized survey experiments, we show that announcing approval of a COVID-19 vaccine one week before the presidential election compared to one week after considerably reduces both beliefs about its safety and efficacy and intended uptake. However, endorsement by Dr. Anthony Fauci increases confidence and uptake among all partisan subgroups. Further, an endorsement by Dr. Fauci increased uptake and confidence in safety even if a vaccine receives pre-election approval. The results here suggest that perceptions of political influence in COVID-19 vaccine approval could significantly undermine the viability of a vaccine as a strategy to end the pandemic.

Aim: To describe serotype's invasive disease potential and the detailed evolution of serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of pneumococcal isolates (carriage and IPD) in children up to 30 months of age over a period during and after the vaccine switch (2015-2018). Methods: S. pneumoniae strains isolated from the nasopharynx of healthy children attending day-care centres (DCCs) and strains from normally sterile sites of children with IPD were serotyped (Quellung-reaction) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed. Invasive disease potential was defined as the serotype-specific odds ratio (OR). Results: The highly invasive (OR > 1) serotypes 12F, 1, 3, 24A/B/F, 33F, 19A, and 9N were not frequently carried (<7.5% of carriage strains). Different serotypes dominated in carriage (23B, 23A, 11A, 15B) versus IPD (12F, 19A, 10A, 33F). PCV13 vaccine serotypes increased in carriage (5.4% (25/463) in period 1 vs 10.3% (69/668) in period 3) and in IPD (7.3% (8/110 in period 1 vs 23.9% (34/142) in period 3) due to an increase (p < 0.01) in serotype 19A. The penicillin non-susceptibility of 19A was lower (p = 0.02) in carriage (6.8%) than in IPD (23.5%). Erythromycin and tetracycline non-susceptibility were more frequent (p < 0.01) in IPD (26.0%; 23.0%) compared to carriage strains (18.2%; 14.5%) and penicillin non-susceptibility increased over the three year study period (carriage: 13.4%, 19.8%, 18.5%, p = 0.05; IPD: 11.8%, 15.0%, 20.4%, p = 0.02). Conclusion: Only some of the serotypes with high invasive disease potential (serotype 1, 3, 19A) in Belgium are included in PCV10 and/or PCV13. This reinforces the need for continuous monitoring, both in healthy children as in children with IPD, to better understand the dynamics of pneumococcal disease, to optimise the composition and implementation of PCVs.

Candidate vaccines have been generated using existing technologies that have been applied for developing vaccines against other infectious diseases. Two new types of platforms, mRNA- and viral vector-based vaccines, have been gaining attention owing to the rapid advancement in their methodologies. In clinical trials, setting appropriate immunological endpoints plays a key role in evaluating the efficacy and safety of candidate vaccines. Updated information about immunological features from individuals who have or have not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 continues to guide effective vaccine development strategies. This review highlights key strategies for generating candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and considerations for vaccine development and clinical trials. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In clinical studies, two vaccinations with AV7909 administered either two or four weeks apart induced an enhanced immune response compared to BioThrax (R) (Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed) (AVA). Anthrax toxin-neutralizing antibody (TNA) levels on Day 70 following initial vaccination that were associated with protection of animals exposed to inhalational anthrax were previously reported for the 0, 4-week AV7909 vaccination regimen. The current study shows that a 0, 2-week AV7909 vaccination regimen protected guinea pigs (GPs) and nonhuman primates (NHPs) against a lethal inhalational anthrax challenge on Days 28 and 70 after the first immunization. An earlier induction of protective TNA levels using a 0, 2-week AV7909 vaccination regimen may provide benefit over the currently approved AVA PEP 0, 2, and 4-week vaccination regimen.

The main objectives of this study were to deter-mine whether the efforts to assess measures for the prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia are still worthwhile, and provide designated vaccination program of HIV-infected persons for government policy based on. Methods: 60 HIV-infected adults in Lanshan county who had never been vaccinated with any pneumo-coccal vaccine were enrolled in this study, voluntary vaccination of PPV23 and One-year follow-up after vaccination can be completed. Result: 76.67% patients (46/60) had serologic response at 12 months after vaccine, CD4 count(<500 cells/ ul or > 500 cells/ul) and Month from diagnosis to first antiviral therapy (<1 month or > 1 month) were related to antibody responses (p < 0.05).In this study, PPV23 was well tolerated, no adverse reaction was reported.11 Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia (9.17%,11/120) occurred in the Unvaccinated group and 1 case(1.67%,1/60)in the vaccination group within one year after vaccination(Fisher's exact probability, P = 0.225). The VE was 81.79%. The per capita benefit was 39.32 dollars, the benefit-cost ratio = 1.19. There are significant statistical differences between the vaccinated group and the non-vaccinated group in outpatient costs (p < 0.05, 95 %CI: 9.29-32.11), Medicine costs (p = 0.017, 95 %CI: 2.47-24.44), and disease related indirect costs (p = 0.038, 95 %CI: 0.93-33.63) within one year of vaccination. Conclusion: Our study results showed that PPV23 can be safely and effectively administered to HIV-1 infected individuals and effectively preventing Streptococcal pneumonia. Considering the cost-benefit of vaccination among HIV-infected persons, as it has been reported in our study, it is necessary to pro-mote the widespread use of the vaccine among HIV-infected persons in the future.

In observational studies vitamin D insufficiency is associated with a reduced seroconversion rate. The effect of cholecalciferol supplementation on hepatitis B vaccination response in haemodialysis patients with vitamin D insufficiency is unknown. Methods: In this randomized open label pilot study 40 unvaccinated haemodialysis patients with 25(OH) D insufficiency (<30 ng/mL) were enrolled. In the supplementation group, we administered cholecalciferol orally in a dose of 28,000 IU weekly for a maximum of 12 weeks. Hepatitis B vaccination (HBvaxPRO 40 mu g i.m. months 0, 1, 6) was performed after achieving a 25(OH)D level >30 ng/mL or after completing three months of supplementation despite failure to achieve the target level. In the control group, patients were vaccinated immediately after randomization. Anti-hepatitis B-antibody titer (anti-HBs) was measured eight weeks after completing the vaccination course. Results: Thirty-seven (26 male, 11 female) patients aged 65 (13.5) years underwent randomization with 17 patients allocated to the control group and 20 patients included in the supplementation group. After 12 weeks of cholecalciferol supplementation, mean (SD) 25(OH)D concentration increased from 15.0 (8.0) to 31.0 (7.1) ng/mL, but remained unchanged in the control group (14.0 (7.1) to 11.6 (7.5) mg/mL). Neither the number of patients with seroconversion (anti-HBs titer >= 10 IU/L; n = 6 (35.3%) vs n = 3 (27.3%), p = 0.704), nor the number of patients with seroprotection (anti-HBs titer >100 IU/L; n = 4 (23.5%) vs n = 2 (18.2%) differed between treatment groups. Cholecalciferol supplementation was safe without treatment-related adverse events. Conclusion: In this small pilot study, high-dose oral cholecalciferol supplementation did not improve the hepatitis B vaccination response in haemodialysis patients with vitamin D insufficiency.

An adsorption method to prepare specific antibody-depleted normal human serum as a source of complement for human serum bactericidal assays for Salmonella	VACCINE			English	Article						Antibodies; Adsorption; Complement; Serum bactericidal assays; Salmonella; Vaccine correlates	INVASIVE NONTYPHOIDAL SALMONELLA; PROTECTION; TYPHIMURIUM; CHILDREN; IMMUNITY; STRAINS; DISEASE; ADULTS	Serum bactericidal assays (SBA) are valuable for assessing the functional activity of natural and vaccineinduced antibodies against many Gram-negative bacteria, such as meningococcus and Salmonella. However, SBA often require an exogenous source of complement and the presence of pre-existing naturally acquired antibodies limits the use of human complement for this purpose. To remove pre-existing Salmonella-specific antibodies, in the context of SBA for Salmonella vaccine research, we incubated human sera with preparations of Salmonella. By incubating at 4 degrees C, pre-existing antibodies were adsorbed onto the Salmonella bacteria with only minimal complement deposition. We assessed the effects of adsorption on specific antibody levels, complement activity and the bactericidal activity of sera using flow cytometry, SBA and haemolytic assays. Adsorption removed Salmonella-specific antibodies and bactericidal activity against Salmonella from whole serum but was not detrimental to serum complement activity, even after five adsorption cycles. Bactericidal activity could be reconstituted in the adsorbed serum by the addition of exogenous specific antibodies. Sera preadsorbed with Salmonella are suitable as a source of human complement to measure the bactericidal activity of Salmonella antibodies. The adsorption method can be used to deplete, simply and rapidly, specific antibodies from serum to prepare a source of human complement for use in SBA for vaccine research and assessment.

Despite the French Public Health Council (FPHC) and the 7th European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL7) recommendations, vaccination coverage remains insufficient. This study aimed to estimate the coverage and determinants of influenza, pneumococcal and diphtheria-teta nus-poliomyelitis (dTP) vaccinations in hematological patients underlying chemotherapy. Methods: A survey was distributed to all patients of the hematology day hospital assessing vaccine uptakes and general opinion about vaccination. Vaccine uptakes were collected from medical and vacci-nation records; knowledge of and attitudes towards vaccinations in immunocompromised patients were evaluated for each general practitioner (GP) by phone call. Adequacy between vaccine uptakes and indi-cation or not to vaccinate according to ECIL7 guidelines was assessed. Factors associated with vaccine uptakes were assessed by multivariate logistic regression. Results: Among 145 patients, 66 % were aged 65 years or older, 40 % were followed for lymphoma and 38 % for multiple myeloma, 39 % were treated with anti-CD20 antibodies. Vaccination coverage was suboptimal for influenza (45-56 %), dTP (44 %) and IPD (16-19 %) regardless of the guidelines followed, with a wide vari-ation in rates by information source (19-76 %). Adequacy rate with ECIL7 recommendations were 63 % and 87 % for influenza and IPD respectively. Information of patients on specific vaccinations was positively asso-ciated with flu and IPD vaccinations, as well as favorable attitude toward vaccination and age > 65 years for flu vaccination, and recommendation by hematologist for pneumococcal vaccination. Conclusion: Despite vaccination opportunities, the complexity of these specific recommendations and the lack of communication between the health actors could explain the suboptimal vaccination coverage in this high-risk population. A proactive attitude of all actors in the city and hospital, including better patient infor-mation and a personalized and evolving vaccination schedule to help GPs to coordinate vaccination would allow to improve vaccine coverage.

J	MacIntyre, CR; Costantino, V; Chanmugam, A				MacIntyre, C. Raina; Costantino, Valentina; Chanmugam, Arjun			The use of face masks during vaccine roll-out in New York City and impact on epidemic control	VACCINE			English	Article							WASHINGTON; COUNTY	Face masks were mandated in New York during the first wave in 2020, and in 2021 the first vaccine programs have commenced. We aimed to examine the impact of face mask and other NPIs use with a gradual roll out of vaccines in NYC on the epidemic trajectory. A SEIR mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was developed for New York City (NYC), which accounted for decreased mobility for lockdown, testing and tracing. Varied mask's usage and efficacy were tested, along with a gradual increase in vaccine uptake over five months. The model has been calibrated using notification data in NYC from March first to June 29. Masks and other NPIs result in immediate impact on the epidemic, while vaccination has a delayed impact, especially when implemented over a long period of time. A pre-emptive, early mandate for masks is more effective than late mask use, but even late mask mandates will reduce cases and deaths by over 20%. The epidemic curve is suppressed by at least 50% of people wearing a mask from the start of the outbreak but surges when mask wearing drops to 30% or less. With a slow roll out of vaccines over five months at uptake levels of 20-70%, NPIs use will still be needed and has a greater impact on epidemic control. When vaccine roll out is slow or partial in cities experiencing local transmission of COVID-19, masks and other NPIs will be necessary to mitigate transmission until vaccine coverage is high and complete. Vaccine alone cannot rapidly control an epidemic because of the time lag to two-dose immunity. Even after high coverage, the ongoing need for NPIs is unknown and will depend on long-term duration of vaccine efficacy, the use of boosters and optimized dosage scheduling and variants of concern.

In this study, a synthetic DNA-based vaccine candidate, known as pSV10-SARS-CoV-2, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was designed and tested in 39 BALB/c mice with BC01, an adjuvant derived from unmethylated CpG motif-containing DNA fragments from the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin genome. Mice vaccinated with pSV10-SARS-CoV-2 with BC01 produced early neutralizing antibodies and devel-oped stronger humoral and cellular immune responses compared to mice that received the DNA vaccine only. Moreover, sera from mice vaccinated with pSV10-SARS-CoV-2 with BC01 can neutralize certain variants, including 614G, 614G + 472 V, 452R, 483A, 501Y.V2, and B.1.1.7. The results of this study demonstrate that the addition of BC01 to a DNA-vaccine for COVID-19 could elicit more effective neutral-izing antibody titers for disease prevention.

Immunization status of children in Nepal and associated factors, 2016	VACCINE			English	Article						Immunization coverage; Nepal; Expanded Program on Immunization; Child health	INACTIVATED POLIOVIRUS VACCINE; COVERAGE; ACCURACY; VALIDITY; RECALL; CARDS	Background: Nepal has made substantial improvements in childhood immunization uptake. However, vaccination levels are still below the country-specific Sustainable Development Goal target of 94.8% coverage by 2025 for children aged 12-23 months who received all immunizations recommended in the national immunization schedule by their first birthday. A better understanding of the predictors of full immunization can inform successful programmatic interventions to improve coverage while also guiding resource allocation to ensure all children are fully vaccinated. This study estimates childhood immunization coverage in Nepal and characterizes the association between immunization status and various sociodemographic predictors. Methods: Data from the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey were used to examine the immunization status of children aged 12-23 months. Immunization status was categorized as fully immunized (receiving all recommended doses), under-immunized (receiving at least one, but not all, recommended doses), and un-immunized (not receiving any doses of any vaccine). Associations between full and under-immunization and potential sociodemographic predictors were assessed using logistic regression. Results: Among 976 children, 78.2% were fully immunized, 21% were under-immunized, and 0.8% were un-immunized. Retention of an immunization card was significantly associated with full immunization status. Mothers who had completed a formal education above secondary school and mothers who were working at time of interview had increased odds of full immunization. Birthing in an institutional setting was also associated with higher odds of full immunization. Conclusions: Overall, immunization coverage in Nepal is relatively high, although it varies by dose and sociodemographic factors. Almost 25% of Nepalese children were not fully immunized, leaving them at increased risk for vaccine-preventable disease related morbidity and mortality. Nepal must continue focused efforts to reach every child and minimize the equity gap; programs may focus on advocating for the use of immunization cards, education and empowerment for girls, and delivery in institutional settings.

The optimal timing for administering a live attenuated vaccine (LAV) after intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) for Kawasaki disease (KD) has not been fully investigated. The recommended interval between vaccination and IVIG therapy for KD differs by country. The present study aimed to evaluate efficacy of LAV six months after IVIG therapy for KD in Japan. Methods: The present, single-arm, prospective, interventional study included patients aged 6 months or older with no medical history of measles, rubella, varicella or mumps or vaccinations against these diseases. The subjects received these vaccinations for the first time at six months after IVIG therapy. Virus specific IgG levels for each virus measured by EIA was examined at nine months after IVIG therapy. If the results were negative, the subjects received a booster vaccination at 12 months after IVIG therapy. The primary outcome was the prevalence of positivity for antibodies after the initial and booster vaccinations. Results: The present study enrolled 32 subjects, 31% of whom were female, with an average age of 10.8 (standard deviation 2.8) months at IVIG therapy. At six months after IVIG therapy, 9% and 6% of the subjects were seropositive for measles and varicella titers, respectively, but were seronegative for the mumps and rubella titers. The seroconversion rate for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella after the initial vaccination was 88%, 6%, 78%, and 16%, respectively. The seroconversion rate after a booster vaccination was 100% for measles and rubella, 97% for mumps, and 77% for varicella. Conclusions: The seroconversion rate was low for LAV at six months after a single dose of IVIG for KD, but seroconversion was achievable with a booster vaccination at 12 months.

Dementia risk following influenza vaccination in a large veteran cohort	VACCINE			English	Article						Epidemiology; Cohort; Vaccination; Dementia	PROPENSITY SCORES; NEUROINFLAMMATION; METFORMIN	Background: Two Taiwan based studies indicated influenza vaccinations are associated with lower risk for dementia in patient cohorts with chronic disease. We determined if such associations exist in a large, nationally distributed sample of U.S. patients not selected for chronic disease. Methods: Data was obtained from Veterans Health Administration medical records (9/1/2009 - 8/31/19). Eligible patients were >65 years of age and free of dementia for two years prior to enrollment through the end of the first influenza season (9/1/2009 to 3/1/2012). Competing risk models estimated the risk of dementia in those with influenza vaccination (n = 66,822) compared to those without vaccination (n = 56,925). Propensity scores and inverse probability of treatment weighting controlled for confounding. Results: On average, patients were 75.5 (+/- 7.3) years of age, 3.8% were female and 91.6% were white race. After controlling for confounding, patients with influenza vaccination were significantly less likely to develop dementia compared to patients without vaccination (HR = 0.86; 95 %CI:0.83-0.88). Patients with 1, 2 or 3-5 vaccines vs. none had similar risks for dementia and patients with > 6 influenza vaccines vs. none had a significant lower risk for dementia (HR = 0.88, 95 %CI: 0.83-0.94). Conclusions: Repeated receipt of influenza vaccinations, compared to remaining unvaccinated, is associated with lower risk for dementia. This is consistent with the hypotheses that vaccinations may reduce risk of dementia by training the immune system and not by preventing specific infectious disease. If vaccines are identified as causative factors in reducing incident dementia, they offer an inexpensive, low-risk intervention with effects greater than any existing preventive measure.

J	Feng, J; Li, Q				Feng, Jiao; LI, Qin			How to ensure vaccine safety: An evaluation of China's vaccine regulation system	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine safety; Regulation system; Public health; China	NO-FAULT COMPENSATION	Vaccination is the most economic and effective measure to deal with infectious diseases and protect pub-lic health. Nowadays, due to the spread of COVID-19 and the ensuing pandemic, safe, effective vaccines are in urgent need. However, due to concerns about vaccine safety, there is still reluctance to vaccinate. In China, in response to the Changchun Changsheng Vaccine incident, the National People's Congress Standing Committee passed the Vaccine Administration Law in 2019, which marks China's first compre-hensive piece of legislation on vaccine regulation. The law establishes a regulatory system covering the entire life cycle of vaccines, introduces the vaccine marketing authorization holder system, stipulates the legal responsibilities of all parties, and further clarifies the compensation system for any individuals who exhibit abnormal reactions to vaccination. In addition, it emphasizes the use of modern technology to build a national vaccine electronic platform for tracing. To balance vaccine efficacy and safety, it is nec-essary to further improve the vaccine risk management mechanism, promote cooperation between gov-ernment and non-governmental actors, and avoid improper interventions in the vaccine market.

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine dose-ranging studies in humans: A systematic review	VACCINE			English	Review						Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines; Dose-range; Systematic review; Immunogenicity	ANTIBODY-RESPONSE; SEROLOGICAL CRITERIA; VARYING DOSAGES; IMMUNOGENICITY; POLYSACCHARIDE; SAFETY; TETANUS; INFANTS; DIPHTHERIA; CHILDREN	Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most common bacterial pathogens of infants and young children. Antibody responses against the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule are the basis of vaccine-mediated protection. We examined the relationship between the dose of polysaccharide in pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) and immunogenicity. Methods: A systematic search of English publications that evaluated the immunogenicity of varying doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines was performed in Medline and Embase (Ovid Sp) databases in August 2019. We included only articles that involved administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in humans and assessed the immunogenicity of more than one serotype-specific saccharide dose. Results were synthesised descriptively due to the heterogeneity of product valency, product content and vaccine schedule. Results: We identified 1691 articles after de-duplication; 9 studies met our inclusion criteria; 2 in adults, 6 in children and 1 in both. Doses of polysaccharide evaluated ranged from 0.44 mcg to 17.6 mcg. In infants, all doses tested elicited IgG geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) above the established correlate of protection (COP; 0.35 mcg/ml). A month after completion of the administered vaccine schedule, 95% confidence intervals of only three out of all the doses evaluated had GMCs that crossed below the COP. In the adult studies, all adults achieved GMCs that would be considered protective in children who have received 3 standard vaccine doses. Conclusion: For some products, the mean antibody concentrations induced against some pneumococcal serotypes increased with increasing doses of the polysaccharide conjugate, but for other serotypes, there were no clear dose-response relationships or the dose response curves were negative. Fractional doses of polysaccharide which contain less than is included in currently distributed formulations may be useful in the development of higher valency vaccines, or dose-sparing delivery for paediatric use.

Reactogenicity symptoms were frequent in vaccine recipients mostly mild to moderate and commonly reported after the second dose. However, there is a lack of data in patients with a previous diagnosis of Covid-19. Methods: We analysed side effects of 311 patients after the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vac-cine, in a french university hospital. We compared patients with COVID-19 history to naive individuals. All the data collected are based on self-reported, including COVID-19 exposure status. Results: Overall, 229 (74%) patients reported at least one side effect. Among participants with history of Covid-19, 95% reported at least one adverse event versus 70% in naive patients (p < 0.01). However, symp-tom intensity was not different between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Vaccine recipients with prior COVID-19 reported more, but no more serious, side effects than naive participants.

Methods: An extended susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model was used to simulate COVID-19 spread when considering diagnosis, isolation, and vaccination of a cohort of 1 million individuals. The scenarios modeled represented 4 pandemic severity scenarios and various times when the vaccine becomes available during the pandemic. Eligible individuals have a probability p of receiving antibody testing prior to vaccination (p = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1). The vaccine was modeled as a single dose vaccine with 90% and 70% efficacy. The value of serology testing was evaluated by comparing the infection attack rate, peak infections, peak day, and deaths. Results: The use of antibody testing to prioritize the allocation of limited vaccines reduces infection attack rates and deaths. The size of the reduction depends on when the vaccine becomes available relative to the infection peak day. The largest percentage reduction in cases and deaths occurs when the vaccine is deployed before and close to the infection peak day. The reduction in the number of cases and deaths diminishes as vaccine deployment is delayed. Conclusions: Antibody testing as part of the vaccination plan is an effective method to maximize the benefit of a COVID-19 vaccine. Decision-makers need to consider relative timing between the infection peak day and when the vaccine becomes available. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cost-effectiveness of infant respiratory syncytial virus preventive interventions in Mali: A modeling study to inform policy and investment decisions	VACCINE			English	Article						Global Health; Vaccine; Pediatric; Respiratory Syncytial Virus; Pneumonia; Prevention	MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; EFFECTIVENESS THRESHOLDS; DISEASE; BLIND	Importance: Low-and middle-income countries have a high burden of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infections. A monoclonal antibody administered monthly is licensed to prevent these infections, but it is cost-prohibitive for most low-and middle-income countries. Long-acting monoclonal antibodies and maternal vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus are under development. Objective: We estimated the likelihood of respiratory syncytial virus preventive interventions (current monoclonal antibody, long-acting monoclonal antibody, and maternal vaccine) being cost-effective in Mali. Design: We modeled age-specific and season-specific risks of respiratory syncytial virus lower respiratory tract infections within monthly cohorts of infants from birth to six months. We parameterized with respiratory syncytial virus data from Malian cohort studies, as well as product efficacy from clinical trials. Integrating parameter uncertainty, we simulated health and economic outcomes for status quo without prevention, intra-seasonal monthly administration of licensed monoclonal antibody, pre-seasonal birth dose administration of a long-acting monoclonal antibody, and maternal vaccination. We then calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of each intervention compared to status quo from the perspectives of the government, donor, and society. Results: At a price of $3 per dose and from the societal perspective, current monoclonal antibody, long acting monoclonal antibody, and maternal vaccine would have incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $4280 (95% CI $1892 to $122,434), $1656 (95% CI $734 to $9091), and $8020 (95% CI $3501 to $47,047) per disability-adjusted life-year averted, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: In Mali, long-acting monoclonal antibody is likely to be cost-effective from both the government and donor perspectives at $3 per dose. Maternal vaccine would need higher efficacy over that measured by a recent trial in order to be considered cost-effective. CO 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Universal influenza vaccine based on conserved antigens provides long-term durability of immune responses and durable broad protection against diverse challenge virus strains in mice	VACCINE			English	Article						Universal influenza vaccine; Durability; Adenoviral vector; Immune responses; Nucleoprotein; Matrix	A VIRUS; HETEROSUBTYPIC IMMUNITY; EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS; HETEROTYPIC IMMUNITY; HEMAGGLUTININ; NUCLEOPROTEIN; INFECTION; MECHANISMS; INDUCTION; ESCAPE	Current influenza vaccines rely on inducing antibody responses to the rapidly evolving hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins, and thus need to be strain-matched. However, predictions of strains that will circulate are imperfect, and manufacturing of new vaccines based on them takes months. As an alternative, universal influenza vaccines target highly conserved antigens. In proof of concept studies of universal vaccine candidates in animal models challenge is generally conducted only a short time after vaccination, but protective immunity lasting far longer is important for the intended public health impact. We address the challenge of providing long-term protection. We demonstrate here broad, powerful, and long-lasting immune protection for a promising universal vaccine candidate. A single intranasal dose of recombinant adenoviruses (rAd) expressing influenza A nucleoprotein (A/NP) and matrix 2 (M2) was used. Extending our previous studies of this type of vaccine, we show that antibody and T-cell responses persist for over a year without boosting, and that protection against challenge persists a year after vaccination and remains broad, covering both group 1 and 2 influenza A viruses. In addition, we extend the work to influenza B. Immunization with influenza B nucleoprotein (B/NP)-rAd also gives immune responses that last a year without boosting and protect against challenge with influenza B viruses of mismatched HA lineages. Despite host immunity to adenoviral antigens, effective readministration is possible a year after primary vaccination, as shown by successful immunization to a transgene product the animals had not seen before. Protection against challenge with divergent and highly pathogenic A/H7N9 virus was weaker but was enhanced by a second dose of vaccine. Thus, this mucosal vaccination to conserved influenza antigens confers very long-lasting immune protection in animals against a broad range of influenza A and B viruses. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Zero-dose children and the immunisation cascade: Understanding immunisation pathways in low and middle-income countries	VACCINE			English	Article						Immunisation; Vaccines; Child health; Healthcare disparities; Developing countries	COVERAGE; INTERVENTIONS	Introduction: Zero-dose prevalence refers to children who failed to receive any routine vaccination. Little is known about the "immunisation cascade" in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), defined as how children move from zero dose to full immunisation. Methods: Using data from national surveys carried out in 92 LMICs since 2010 and focusing on the four basic vaccines delivered in infancy (BCG, polio, DPT and MCV), we describe zero-dose prevalence and the immunisation cascade in children aged 12 to 23 months. We also describe the most frequent combinations of vaccines (or co-coverage) among children who are partially immunized. Analyses are stratified by country income groups, household wealth quintiles derived from asset indices, sex of the child and area of residence. Results were pooled across countries using child populations as weights. Results: In the 92 countries, 7.7% were in the zero-dose group, and 3.3%, 3.4% and 14.6% received one, two or three vaccines, respectively; 70.9% received the four types and 59.9% of the total were fully immunised with all doses of the four vaccines. Three quarters (76.8%) of children who received the first vaccine received all four types. Among children with a single vaccine, polio was the most common in low-and lower-middle income countries, and BCG in upper-middle income countries. There were sharp inequalities according to household wealth, with zero-dose prevalence ranging from 12.5% in the poorest to 3.4% in the wealthiest quintile across all countries. The cascades were similar for boys and girls. In terms of dropout, 4% of children receiving BCG did not receive DPT1, 14% receiving DPT1 did not receive DPT3, and 9% receiving DPT3 did not progress to receive MCV. Interpretation. Focusing on zero-dose children is particularly important because those who are reached with the first vaccine are highly likely to also receive remaining vaccines. (c) 2021 The Authors.

The available and internationally recommended WHO-prequalified OCVs (Dukoral, Shanchol, Euvichol) contain multiple heat and formalin-killed V. cholerae strains of Inaba and Ogawa serotypes. MSD Wellcome Trust Hilleman Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. in technical collaboration with University of Gothenburg, Sweden has developed a new single strain OCV, Hillchol. This vaccine consists of formaldehyde-inactivated whole cell El Tor V. cholerae O1 bacteria engineered into the Hikojima serotype for stable expression of both the Ogawa (AB) and Inaba (AC) LPS antigens on the bacterial surface. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of this novel and potentially much less expensive OCV in comparison with Shanchol. Methods: We conducted a randomized, non-inferiority, age-descending clinical trial of OCV (Hillchol vs. Shanchol) in the Mirpur area of Dhaka city from July 2016 to May 2017. This study was carried out in three different age cohorts (1-<5, 5-17 and >18 years old). Two doses of vaccine were given at 14 days intervals to 560 healthy participants. Findings: No serious adverse events were reported. There were no significant differences in the rates of adverse events between the test vaccine (Hillchol) and the comparator (Shanchol) group. Serum vibriocidal antibody responses in all age groups combined were comparable for all the O1 Ogawa (59% vs. 67%; 90% CI of difference: -14.55, -0.84) and Inaba (70% vs. 71%; 90% CI of difference: -7.24, 5.77) serotypes, showing that the Hillchol vaccine was non-inferior to Shanchol. This new vaccine was also non-inferior to Shanchol in the different age strata. Conclusion: The safety and immunogenicity profile of the new OCV Hillchol is comparable to Shanchol in persons residing in a cholera-endemic setting. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Many have since resumed services with an emphasis on catch-up vaccinations. This paper evaluated immunization disruptions during India's March-May 2020 lockdown and the extent to which subsequent catch-up efforts reversed them in Rajasthan, India. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we conducted phone surveys to collect immunization details for 2,144 children that turned one year old between January and October 2020. We used logistic regressions to compare differences in immunization timeliness and completed first-year immunization status among children that were due immunizations just before (unexposed), during (heavily exposed), and after (post-exposure) the lockdown. Results: Relative to unexposed children, heavily exposed children were significantly less likely to be immunized at or before 9 months (OR 0.550; 95% CI 0.367-0.824; p = 0.004), but more likely to be immunized at 10-12 months (OR 1.761; 95% CI 1.196-2.591; p = 0.004). They were also less likely to have completed their key first-year immunizations (OR 0.624; 95% CI 0.478-0.816; p = 0.001) by the time of survey. In contrast, post-exposure children showed no difference in timeliness or completed first-year immunizations relative to unexposed children, despite their younger age. First-year immunization coverage among heavily exposed children decreased by 6.9 pp to 10.4 pp (9.7% to 14.0%). Declines in immunization coverage were larger among children in households that were poorer, less educated, lower caste, and residing in COVID red zones, although subgroup comparisons were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Disruptions to immunization services resulted in children missing immunization during the lockdown, but catch-up efforts after it was eased ensured many children were reached at later ages. Nevertheless, catch-up was incomplete and children due their immunizations during the lockdown remained less likely to be fully immunized 4-5 months after it lifted, even as younger cohorts due immunizations in June or later returned to pre-lockdown schedules.

Annually, ACIP delivers recommendations to the CDC director for guidance about United States vaccine use and publishes the Adult Immunization Schedule. Updated schedules feature changes to vaccine recommendations as well as changes to the schedule's usability for physicians. The objective of this study was to determine physicians' attitudes about the Adult Immunization Schedule. Surveys were administered to a sentinel physician network from October 2019 through January 2020. Physicians that responded were comfortable using the Adult Immunization Schedule, but reported confusion about some medical condition-based indications. Physicians reported a lack engagement with mobile applications, CDC Vaccine Schedules and Shots by STFM (the Society for Teachers of Family Medicine). Future work should focus on increasing clarity regarding the recommendations with medical condition-based indications and increasing knowledge of mobile applications for physicians.

Antigenic evolution of contemporary clade 2.3.4.4 HPAI H5 influenza A viruses and impact on vaccine use for mitigation and control	VACCINE			English	Article						Avian Influenza; Highly pathogenic avian influenza; Evolution; Vaccine; H5; 2; 3; 4; 4b; Antigenic; Poultry	GLOBAL SPREAD; MAFFT	Since 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5 subtype have been maintained in poultry, periodically spilling back into wild migratory birds and spread to other geographic regions, with re-introduction to domestic birds causing severe impacts for poultry health, production and food sustain ability. Successive waves of infection have also resulted in substantial genetic evolution and reassortment, enabling the emergence of multiple clades and subtypes within the H5 2.3.4.4 HPAI viruses. Control of AI is principally through either culling or through vaccination using conventional vaccines. Here, we antigenically and genetically characterise the emerging 2020/21 H5NX clade 2.3.4.4 strains and assess cross-reactivity to putative vaccine strains using chicken antisera. We demonstrate significant antigenic differences between commercially available poultry vaccines and currently circulating viruses suggesting that vaccination options might be suboptimal in the current outbreaks.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake among a community-recruited sample of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in the three largest cities in Canada from 2017 to 2019	VACCINE			English	Article						Human papillomavirus; Men who have sex with men; Vaccine uptake; Vaccine preventable disease; Immunization program; Primary prevention	YOUNG MEN; HEPATITIS-B; COVERAGE	Introduction: In 2015/2016, Canada's largest provinces implemented publicly-funded human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) < 26 years old. We sought to describe HPV vaccine uptake among GBM and determine barriers and facilitators to vaccine initiation with a focus on healthcare access and utilization. Methods: Engage is a cohort study among GBM aged 16 + years in three Canadian cities recruited from 2017 to 2019 via respondent driven sampling (RDS). Men completed a comprehensive questionnaire at baseline. By publicly-funded vaccine eligibility (<26 years old = eligible for vaccination, >27 years old = ineligible), we described HPV vaccine uptake (initiation = 1 + dose, completion = 3 doses) and explored factors associated with vaccine initiation using Poisson regression. All analyses were weighted with the RDS-II Volz-Heckathorn estimator. Results: Across the three cities, 26-35% and 14-21% of men < 26 years and 7-26% and 2-9% of men > 27 years initiated and completed HPV vaccination, respectively. Vaccine initiation was significantly associated with STI/HIV testing or visiting a HIV care specialist in the past six months (<26: prevalence ratio[PR] = 2.15, 95% confidence interval[CI] 1.06-4.36; >27: PR = 2.73, 95%CI 1.14-6.51) and past hepatitis A or B vaccination (<26: PR = 2.88, 95%CI 1.64-5.05; >27: PR = 2.03, 95%CI 1.07-3.86). Among men > 27 years old, vaccine initiation was also positively associated with accessing PrEP, living in Vancouver or Toronto, but negatively associated with identifying as Latin American and increasing age. Vaccine initiation was twice as likely among men > 27 years with private insurance versus no insurance. Conclusions: Sixty-five to 74% of men eligible for publicly-funded vaccine across the three cities remained unvaccinated against HPV by 2019. High vaccine cost may partly explain even lower uptake among men > 27 years old. Men seeking sexual health care were more likely to initiate vaccination; bundling vaccination with these services may help improve HPV vaccine uptake. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is great concern regarding serotype replacement and the increase in antibiotic resistant strains expressing non-vaccine capsular types. In addition, conjugate vaccines have high production costs, a limiting factor for their implementation in mass immunization programs in developing countries. These limitations have prompted the development of novel vaccine strategies for prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. The use of conserved pneumococcal antigens such as recombinant proteins or protein fragments presents an interesting serotype-independent alternative. Pht is a family of surface-exposed proteins which have been evaluated as potential vaccine candidates with encouraging results. The present work investigated the immune responses elicited by subcutaneous immunization of mice with the polyhistidine triad protein D (PhtD) and its amino and carboxyl terminal fragments. The proteins were immunogenic and protective against pneumococcal sepsis in mice. Antibodies raised against PhtD increased complement C3b deposition on the pneumococcal surface, mainly mediated by the alternative pathway. Sera from mice immunized with PhtD and PhtD_Cter pro-moted an increase in bacterial uptake by mouse phagocytes. The interaction of PhtD with the comple-ment system regulator factor H was investigated in silico and in vitro by ELISA and western blot, confirming PhtD as a factor-H binding protein. Our results support the inclusion of PhtD and more specif-ically, its C-terminal fragment in a multicomponent serotype independent vaccine and suggests a role for the complement system in PhtD-mediated protection.

This review aimed to compare the rates of vaccine acceptability, uptake and completion, and to identify determinants of vaccine outcomes specific to MSM to inform a theoretical framework. Methods: In January 2020 four databases were explored to identify vaccination behaviours and associated factors among MSM. A narrative systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. Data were synthesised for theoretical modelling. Results: Seventy-eight studies, mostly from the USA, were included. The average vaccine acceptability was 63% (median = 72%, range: 30%-97%), vaccine uptake 45% (median = 42%, range: 5%-100%) and vaccine completion 47% (median = 45%, range: 12%-89%). Six categories of factors associated with vaccination acceptability, uptake and completion were conceptualised: Individual (e.g., demographic and psychosocial); Interpersonal (e.g., peer education); Healthcare provider (e.g., vaccine recommendation); Organisational and practice setting (e.g., routine collection of patient sexual orientation information that is integrated into a clinical decision support system); Community environment (e.g., targeted health promotion campaigns); and National, state and local policy environment (e.g., public health guidelines targeting MSM). Conclusion: Despite overall high levels of acceptability, uptake and completion rates were below targets predicted by cost-effectiveness modelling across all recommended vaccines. These parameters may need to be adjusted for more precise estimations of cost-effectiveness. Addressing the multiple levels of determinants, as outlined in our theoretical framework, will help guide interventions to increase vaccine completion among MSM. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Serotypes were determined for 387 isolates of S. pneumoniae by Quellung reaction. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested with the E-test or disc diffusion method. Results: The most common serotypes were type 19F and confirmed for 88 isolates (22.7%), followed by 19A (15.0%), 6B (7.8%), 16F (7.8%), 23F (7.0%) and 15A (4.4%). The coverage rates of PCV13 and PPSV23 were 63.3% and 65.1%. With the increase of age, the proportion of PCV13 types decreased significantly, from 71.3% (<2 years old) to 41.9% (>60 years old). The intermediate rate and resistance rate of the isolates to oral penicillin were 48.6% and 45.2%, respectively. The resistance rate of erythromycin was high (94.4%). The PCV13 isolates was more resistant to penicillin than the non-PCV13 ones. Conclusion: The PCV13 coverage rate in pediatric isolates was higher than those in adult isolates. The adults, especially the elderly, may be the reservoir of non-PCV13 types. It is necessary to investigate the serotype distribution of S. pneumoniae based on all age population to assess potential epidemics of non-vaccine serotype associated with PCVs administration.

A self-controlled case series analysis was completed. Anaphylaxis, Guillain-Barr & eacute; syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis were secondary outcomes. A total of 107,231 children aged 1-18 months received >1 doses of 4CMenB vaccination. Most 4CMenB exposure (93%) was on the same day as other vaccines within a complete national immunisation program stage. With day 0 as day of vaccination, 43 seizures occurred in days 0-6 after 239,505 doses, and 23 febrile seizures occurred in days 0-6, and 4 Kawasaki disease cases in days 1-28 after 194,929 4CMenB doses. Adjusted incidence rate ratios including all 4CMenB exposures were 1.43 (95%CI: 1.02-2.02) for seizures and 1.72 (95%CI: 1.08-2.75) for febrile seizures. There were insufficient cases to model Kawasaki disease, and no cases of the secondary outcomes in risk periods when they may be associated with the vaccination. This study shows few cases of the outcomes after vaccination including 4CMenB with an increased risk of seizures and febrile seizures. It is not possible to attribute the finding to one specific vaccination as the majority of 4CMenB was given with other vaccinations. Trial registration: NA. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Systematic reviews are recommended to be used in this process, but conducting them requires significant resources, which many NITAGs lack. Using existing systematic reviews could help address this problem. The Robert Koch Institute and collaborators set up the SYSVAC2 project to facilitate the retrieval of existing systematic reviews and offer guidance on using them. This will include an online registry of systematic reviews relevant to immunization policy and an online course on how to use existing reviews. This report describes an international expert workshop held in December 2019 to develop consensus on methods for using existing reviews and other relevant factors for the registry and course. Members from NITAGs representing different regions of the world presented their experiences of using systematic reviews and reflected on challenges inhibiting use. Three methodologists considered different aspects of using systematic reviews. Interactive sessions followed, where implications for SYSVAC2 were discussed. Participants supported having critical appraisal ratings, plain language summaries, keyword search, and data visualization functions in the registry. They suggested tailoring course content to different audiences and including overviews of reviews as a topic and examples of how NITAGs have used or could use existing reviews. Participants agreed that whether a review is out-of-date should be decided by those using the review rather than registry staff. The registry could help by highlighting the date of literature search or included primary studies. Participants recommended a visualization function to highlight overlap across reviews and guidance on handling challenges to using reviews, ideally, involving a practical element. No consensus was reached on which critical appraisal tool to use for reviews in the registry, but a majority of participants wanted registry staff to perform appraisals. Formative research is planned before the registry and online course are launched in 2020.

J	Daniel, M; Liang, BH; Luo, M				Daniel, Mathew; Liang, Binhua; Luo, Ma			Assessment of the population coverage of an HIV-1 vaccine targeting sequences surrounding the viral protease cleavage sites in Gag, Pol, or all 12 protease cleavage sites	VACCINE			English	Article						HIV-1 protease cleavage sites; Population coverage; Epitope vaccine; HIV-1 Gag; HIV-1 Pol	INHIBITORS; PROGRESS	Development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine has been a great challenge faced by the research community. Recently a novel strategy targeting the viral protease cleavage sites (PCSs) has been tested and shown promising results. This T cell-based vaccine strategy depends on individuals expressing certain HLA class I molecules and since each population has unique distributions of HLA class I alleles, population coverage analysis is required to assess feasibility. Utilizing the validated CD8 T cell epitope data from previous studies we conducted coverage analysis of an HIV-1 vaccine targeting the sequences surrounding all 12-PCSs, Gag-PCSs, and Pol-PCSs. The population coverage, average epitope hit, and minimum number of epitopes recognized by 90% of the population (PC90) was compiled for 66 countries and 16 geograph-ical regions using the web tool provided by "Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource". Our anal-ysis shows that the coverage for an HIV-1 vaccine targeting sequences surrounding all 12 PCSs, 5 PCSs in Gag or 6 PCSs in Pol can cover similar to 70% to similar to 100% of the populations analyzed. There was no statistical dif-ference in population coverages for the majority of populations examined when comparing the CD8 T cell epitope sets (12-PCSs, Gag-PCSs, and Pol-PCSs). As expected, vaccines targeting more sequences will have more CD8 T cell epitopes, as the mean average epitope hit for the 12-PCSs, Gag-PCSs, and Pol-PCSs across all countries studied was 9.45, 4.76, and 4.74, respectively, and across all geographical regions was 9.76, 4.99, and 4.92, respectively. The average PC90 for the 12-PCSs, Gag-PCSs, and Pol-PCSs across all countries studied was 2.53, 1.31, and 1.41, respectively, and across all geographical regions was 2.24, 1.23, and 1.29, respectively. Thus, vaccines targeting sequences surrounding the HIV-1 PCSs can cover broad populations; however, whether targeting a subset of the PCSs is sufficient to prevent acquisition requires fur-ther preclinical investigation.

The aim of the study was to demonstrate the pneumococcal carriage rate and the serotype distribution in healthy children under 5 years in Turkey who were vaccinated with PCV13. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study including the collection of questionnaire data and nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens among children aged <5 years from five centers from March 2019 to March 2020. Pneumococcal isolates were identified using optochin sensitivity and bile solubility. Serotyping was performed using a latex agglutination kit and Quellung reaction. Results: NP swab samples were collected from 580 healthy children. The observed overall carriage rate was 17.8%. None of the hypothesised predictors of S. pneumoniae carriage, except maternal education level was statistically significant (p = 0.017). High maternal education level appeared to decrease the risk (lower vs. higher maternal education OR: 1.992 [95% CI; 1.089-3.643], p = 0.025). The overall NP S. pneumoniae carriage prevalence for the PCV13-vaccinated children was 17.8% (103/580). The most common serotypes detected were serotype 15B (n = 10, 9.7%), serotype 23F (n = 9, 8.7%), serotype 23A (n = 9, 8.7%), serotype 11A (n = 7, 6.7%), serotype 19F (n = 5, 4.8%) and serotype 15F (n = 5, 4.8%). Of the isolates, 28 (27.2%) were in PCV13 vaccine strains (VSs), and 75 (72.8%) strains were non-VS. The serotype coverage rate was 27.2% for PCV13. Conclusion: The overall S. pneumoniae carriage rate was higher than in earlier studies from Turkey. Post-vaccine era studies from around the world have reported a decrease in VS serotypes and a 'serotype replacement' to non-VS serotypes, as we determined in our study. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Guidance for design and analysis of observational studies of fetal and newborn outcomes following COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19 vaccination; Pregnancy; Vaccine safety		COVID-19 vaccines are now being deployed as essential tools in the public health response to the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Pregnant individuals are a unique subgroup of the population with distinctive considerations regarding risk and benefit that extend beyond themselves to their fetus/newborn. As a complement to traditional pharmacovigilance and clinical studies, evidence to comprehensively assess COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy will need to be generated through observational epidemiologic studies in large populations. However, there are several unique methodological challenges that face observational assessments of vaccination during pregnancy, some of which may be more pronounced for COVID-19 studies.

Influenza vaccination in the time of COVID-19: A national US survey of adults	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccination; Influenza vaccination; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Health beliefs		Introduction: Decisions about influenza vaccination for fall-winter 2020 were made against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. During May 2020, the authors examined intended vaccination in the next 12 months in relationship to demographic variables, healthcare attitudes, and personal COVID-19 experiences for two samples of adults-those who did not receive influenza vaccine during the prior 12 months, and those who did. Methods: In May 2020, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted with a national US sample. Participants reported prior influenza vaccination (yes/no during prior 12 months) and anticipated vaccination (yes/no during next 12 months). Covariates included demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, race-ethnicity, political ideology), general beliefs (e.g., benefits of vaccines, altruistic attitudes), and COVID-19 health beliefs and experiences (COVID-19 worry and severity, perception of COVID-19 as a community threat, knowing someone with COVID-19). For each group, hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was conducted with intent to vaccinate as the outcome. Results: Among participants (n = 3502), 47% did not receive influenza vaccine in the prior 12 months and 53% had; 25.5% of non-vaccinators and 91.9% of vaccinators intended future vaccination. For nonvaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with race/ethnicity (Hispanics were more likely to intend than white-NH; AOR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.23-2.4), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR = 2.19; 95% CI = 1.88-2.54), and perception of COVID-19 as a community threat (AOR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.49-2.45). For vaccinators, odds of intending vaccination was associated with age (AOR = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.03-1.05), race/ethnicity (Black-NH and Other-NH were less likely to intend than white-NH, AOR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.36-0.999; and AOR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.24-0.84, respectively), greater perceived benefits of vaccination (AOR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.45-2.45) and greater perception of collective benefits of vaccines (AOR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.15-1.90). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic may have served as a cue to action for influenza vaccination intention among some prior non-vaccinators whereas intention among prior vaccinators is more related to positive attitudes toward vaccination.

It can be prevented using mumps vaccines, administered as a measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. For first and second dose immunization, children aged 12-15 months and 4-6 years have been administered this vaccine since 1997 in Korea. Nevertheless, mumps outbreaks still occur in vaccinated populations worldwide. Hence, immunity against these diseases may be attenuated, or there are antigenic differences between currently available vaccine strains and circulating wild-type viruses. After the introduction of national immunization programs in Korea, mumps cases became sporadic. Viral genotypes F, H, and I have emerged since 1998 whereas the vaccine strains belong to genotype A. Here, we compared the amino acid sequences of the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene from wild-type viruses and the mumps vaccine and measured the cross-neutralization titers between them. We selected the F, H, and I wild-type mumps strains circulating in Korea from 1998 to 2016 and analyzed changes in the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the HN gene. We measured mumps virus-specific IgG and rapid focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) titers in Korean isolates and sera obtained from 50 children aged 1-2 years who had been administered a single dose of MMR vaccine. Analysis of the HN protein sequences disclosed no changes in the glycosylation sites but did reveal 4-5 differences between the Korean isolates and the genotype A vaccine strain in terms of the neutralizing epitope sites on their HN proteins. Post-vaccination FRNT titers were significantly lower against genotypes F, H, and I than they were against genotype A. This finding highlights the possibility of a recurrence of mumps outbreaks in vaccinated populations depending on the degree of genetic conservation of the HN gene. Further research into this issue is needed to prevent the resurgence of mumps. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PPV for primary prevention of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the elderly in Australia. Methods: A Markov model was developed to investigate the costs, QALYs and ICERs of PPV administration in those aged >= 65 years without a history of ACS from the perspective of Australian healthcare system, using elderly-specific clinical data and local costs from Australian Heart Foundation and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare databases. A ten-years horizon was used, and all costs and health outcomes were discounted at 5% annually. The impact of various assumptions was tested with sensitivity analyses. Results: In the base-case analysis, interventional strategy (100% PPV coverage) prevented an additional five incident ACS events among 1000 "healthy" elderly individuals compared with standard of care (50% PPV coverage) over 10 years. 100% PPV was the dominant strategy, resulting in a QALY gain of 0.0075 and cost saving of AU$ 179 per person. The results were most sensitive to effectiveness of PPV at preventing ACS and reducing hospital bed-days, and cost of ACS admission, but in all sensitivity analyses 100% PPV remained the dominant strategy. Shortening the time horizon from ten to five years resulted in further cost saving. Conclusion: PPV for the prevention of ACS in those aged >= 65 is a dominant intervention strategy, with cost saving and minor improvements in QALY. Healthcare providers should promote PPV administration for all eligible populations. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Saponins have been widely used as adjuvants for many years in several vaccines - especially for intracellular pathogens - including the recent and somewhat revolutionary malaria and shingles vaccines. In view of the immunoadjuvant potential of Q. brasiliensis saponins, the present study aimed to characterize the QB-80 saponin-rich fraction and a nanoadjuvant prepared with QB-80 and lipids (IMXQB-80). In addition, the performance of such adjuvants was examined in experimental inactivated vaccines against Zika virus (ZIKV). Analysis of QB-80 by DI-ESI-ToF by negative ion electrospray revealed over 29 saponins that could be assigned to known structures existing in their congener Q. saponaria, including the well-studied QS-21 and QS-7. The QB-80 saponins were a micrOTOF able to self-assembly with lipids in ISCOM-like nanoparticles with diameters of approximately 43 nm, here named IMXQB-80. Toxicity assays revealed that QB-80 saponins did present some haemolytical and cytotoxic potentials; however, these were abrogated in IMXQB-80 nanoparticles. Regarding the adjuvant activity, QB-80 and IMXQB-80 significantly enhanced serum levels of anti-Zika virus IgG and subtypes (IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2c) as well as neutralized antibodies when compared to an unadjuvanted vaccine. Furthermore, the nanoadjuvant IMXQB-80 was as effective as QB-80 in stimulating immune responses, yet requiring fourfold less saponins to induce the equivalent stimuli, and with less toxicity. These findings reveal that the saponin fraction QB-80, and particularly the IMXQB-80 nanoadjuvant, are safe and capable of potentializing immune responses when used as adjuvants in experimental ZIKV vaccines.

Pakistan is one of the countries in which polio is still endemic in the 21st century. In 2019, 146 polio cases were reported across the country with some resulting in deaths. Following the spread of rumors insinuating that children were falling sick after receiving an anti-polio vaccine, a mob attacked and set fire to a small hospital in the Peshawar district in April 2019. The present study investigates readers' discussions that emerged from Dawn's online readers' comments on polio-related news stories in Pakistan. Methods: Using thematic analysis, we analyzed (N = 2216) comments made by readers in the poliorelated news stories published on Dawn.com from January 1, 2012, to March 1, 2020. Results: Seven major themes emerged from the analysis of the comments: 1) reasons for and challenges resulting in the failure to eradicate polio; 2) proposed solutions and policy changes to eradicate polio; 3) misinformation; 4) criticism, frustration, and shame; 5) comparison of Pakistan to other countries; 6) the internet as a public sphere; 7) suffering, empathy, and appreciation. Overall, our findings suggested that commenters are knowledgeable about polio vaccines and consider polio a serious threat to public health in Pakistan. Conclusion: Our study not only validated previous study findings such as reasons, challenges, and issues related to polio vaccination, but also found new challenges in online news sites concerning misinformation on polio and polio vaccination in Pakistan.

Emergence of the PCV2d genotype has been linked with PCV2-associated disease (PCVAD) outbreaks. However, no study has been conducted efficacy of an experimental PCV2d-based subunit vaccine in pigs. Therefore, PCV2b- and PCV2d-based capsid (CP) proteins were generated using a baculovirus (Bac) expression system, and we evaluated the protective immune responses in a commercial pig farm where predominant PCV2d is circulating. Methods: Eighteen 3-week-old pigs with maternal antibodies were randomly divided into four groups, and were immunized with purified Bac-2dCP, mixed 1:1 ratio with purified Bac-2bCP and Bac-2dCP (Bac-mCP), a commercial PCV2a-based subunit vaccine (VAC) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as controls. Results: The Bac-2dCP and Bac-mCP groups had significantly higher PCV2b- or PCV2d-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody without interference by maternal antibody compared to control group in pigs naturally infected with PCV2d. Interestingly, not only serum IL-4 level was significantly increased in the Bac-2dCP group, but also PCV2d viremia level was significantly reduced than the control group. Conclusions: The recombinant Bac-2dCP subunit vaccine is a good candidate for the effective reduction against PCV2d infection. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Thenceforward, there is no comprehensive report on diversity of G9 rotavirus strains from 116E; therefore, the present study evaluates the VP7 gene sequence diversity of G9 strains (retrieved from GenBank) from different geographical regions (1987-2016). Additionally, 22 recently collected G9 strains from Himachal Pradesh and Delhi (2013-2016) were included in the phylogenetic analysis. Interestingly, unlike 116E which belong to lineage-II all other G9 rotavirus including these 22 samples clustered together in a separate lineage (III). Further, six amino acid substitutions including one novel, K143M (epitope 7-2) different from 116E were detected mostly in the neutralization epitopes of VP7 protein (neutralization escape mutants). Overall, the accumulation of identified substitutions in VP7 epitopes and evolution of G9 strains in India may have impact on Rotavac (R) efficacy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gulpinar, G; Uzun, MB				Gulpinar, Gizem; Uzun, Mehmet Barlas			Examining community pharmacists' intention to provide pharmacist-driven vaccination services: A structural equation modelling	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccination; Community pharmacy; Structural equation modelling; Theory of planned behavior; Pharmacy practice; Pharmaceutical care	ROUTINE IMMUNIZATION; PHARMACEUTICAL CARE; BARRIERS; BEHAVIOR	Background: The evidence of pharmacists' current involvement in vaccination services in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is uncertain. This study would be a first step to develop vaccination ser-vices by investigating community pharmacists' intention to be involved in PDV services not just during COVID-19 pandemic but also during standard service provision in Turkey which can be taken as an exam-ple across LMICs. Objective: Considering the efforts to empower community pharmacists in service provision, the goal of the present study was to develop a structural equation model to explain the "Pharmacist-Driven Vaccination Service Intention Model (PDV-SIM)" by using the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Methods: Based on the constructs of TPB, a measurement tool was developed. Sub-factors of PDV service intention was determined by conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA). In the second step, confirma-tory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to prove the theoretical structure of the tool. Finally, a model explaining the relationship between observed variables, latent constructs from TPB was developed by SEM analysis. Results: In the proposed PDV-SIM, patient related attitude toward PDV services, attitude toward negative consequences of PDV services, and subjective norm about PDV services had an impact on the behavioral intention of community pharmacists. Nevertheless, professional development attitude toward PDV ser-vices and perceived behavioral control were not evaluated as determinants of the behavioral intention. Conclusion: Results of this study revealed that TPB is appropriate for modelling PDV service intention of community pharmacists. This model can be utilized as a guide to potential pharmacy regulatory bodies and policy makers in their efforts to enable community pharmacists as vaccinators across LMICs. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding disparities in vaccine intentions and reasons for vaccine hesitancy are important for developing effective strategies for ameliorating racial/ethnic COVID-19 inequities. Methods: Using six waves of the large, nationally representative Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey data from January 6-March 29, 2021 (n = 459,235), we examined national and state estimates for vaccination intent, defined as receipt of > 1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine or definite intent to be vaccinated, by race/ethnicity with stratification by household income and age group. In separate logistic regression models, we also examined the interaction between race/ethnicity and household income, and race/ethnicity and age group, and its association with vaccination intent. Lastly, we examined reasons for not vaccinating by race/ethnicity. Results: Vaccination intent differed by racial/ethnic group, household income, and age group nationally and by Health and Human Services (HHS) region and state. A significant interaction was observed between race/ethnicity and household income (F(8,72) = 4.50, p < 0.001), and race/ethnicity and age group (F(8,72) =15.66, p < 0.001). Non-Hispanic Black adults with lower income (<$35,000) and younger age (18-49 years) were least likely to intend to vaccinate. Similar disparities across racial/ethnic groups were seen across most HHS regions and states. Concerns about possible side effects and effectiveness were significantly higher among all minority groups compared to non-Hispanic White adults. Conclusion: Disparities in vaccination intent by racial/ethnic groups underscore the need for interventions and recommendations designed to improve vaccination coverage and confidence in underserved communities, such as younger and lower income racial/ethnic minority groups. Efforts to reduce disparities and barriers to vaccination are needed to achieve equity in vaccination coverage, and ultimately, to curb COVID-19 transmission. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine Reactogenicity: The key role of immunity	VACCINE			English	Article						SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19; BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine; Reactogenicity; T-cell responses; Booster effect		We examined the impact of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immunity on BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine reactogenicity. Of 96 healthcare workers (HCWs), 76% reported any vaccine reaction (first dose: 70%, second dose: 67%), none of which was severe. Following first dose, systemic reactions were significantly more frequent among HCWs with past infection than in infection-naive individuals, and among HCWs with pre-existing cellular immunity than in those without it. The rate of systemic reactions after second dose was 1.7 and 2.0-times higher than after first dose among infection-naive HCWs and those without pre-existing cellular immunity, respectively. Levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells before vaccination were higher in HCWs with systemic reactions after the first dose than in those without them. BNT162b2 vaccine reactogenicity after first dose is attributable to pre-existing cellular immunity elicited by prior COVID-19 or cross-reactivity. Reactogenicity following second dose suggests an immunity-boosting effect. Overall, these data may reduce negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines. Study Registration.

The only licensed TB vaccine, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), has low efficacy against TB in adults and is not recommended in people with impaired immunity. The incorporation of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) secretion system ESX-1 into BCG improves immunogenicity and protection against TB in animal models, which is associated with the secretion of the ESX-1-dependent protein ESAT-6. However, the resulting strain, BCG::ESX1(Mtb) , has been deemed unsafe as a human vaccine, due to prolonged persistence and increased virulence in immunocompromised mice. In this study, we describe a new recombinant BCG strain that uncouples the beneficial aspects of ESAT-6 secretion from the detrimental ESX-1 effects on virulence and persistence. The strain was constructed by fusing the ESAT-6-encoding gene esxA to the general secretion signal for the mycobacterial type VII secretion pathway protein PE25. This new strain, BCG::ESAT6-PE25SS, secretes full-length ESAT-6 via the ESX-5 secretion system, which in contrast to ESX-1 is also present in BCG. In vivo testing revealed that ESX-5-targeted ESAT-6 export, induces cytosolic contact, generates ESAT-6-specific T cells and enhances the protective efficacy against TB disease, but is associated with low virulence and reduced persistence in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Additionally, compared to BCG::ESX1(Mtb) and parental BCG, mucosal administration of BCG::ESAT6-PE25SS is associated with more rapid clearance from the lung. These results warrant further studies to evaluate BCG::ESAT6-PE25SS as a potential live attenuated vaccine candidate for TB. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The emergence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants may pose a significant threat to our efforts in controlling the pandemic. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on the efficacy of available vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics is currently being investigated. SARS-CoV-2 has been implicated to be originated from animals due to cross-species jumping and raises zoonotic concerns due to the potential for reintroduction into the human populations via interspecies transmission between humans and animals. Natural SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in domestic animals (dog, cat, and ferret), captive animals (tiger, lion, snow leopard, puma, otter, and gorilla), and wild and farmed minks. Vaccination of domestic animals can prevent the possible introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the feral population and subsequent transmission to wildlife. Although the need to vaccinate susceptible animal species, such as cats, minks, and great apes, might seem irrational from a public health standpoint, the successful elimination of SARS-CoV-2 will only be possible by controlling the transmission in all susceptible animal species. This is necessary to prevent the re-emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the future. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Miya, TV; Groome, MJ; Rosa, DD				Miya, Thabiso, V; Groome, Michelle J.; Rosa, Debra de Assis			TLR genetic variation is associated with Rotavirus-specific IgA seroconversion in South African Black infants after two doses of Rotarix vaccine	VACCINE			English	Article						Rotavirus; Vaccine; Innate immunity; RIG-like receptors; Toll like receptors; host genetics; seroconversion	TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR-3; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; CELLULAR-IMMUNITY; DOUBLE-BLIND; IMMUNOGENICITY; POLYMORPHISMS; EFFICACY; IDENTIFICATION; MUTATIONS; CHILDREN	Live oral rotavirus vaccines have significantly reduced rotavirus-related diarrheal morbidity and mortality globally, but low efficacy of these vaccines is observed in low-income countries where disease burden is highest. The biological basis of rotavirus vaccine failure remains unknown but likely includes both microbial and host factors. We investigated associations between 19 candidate SNPs in the TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, DDX58 and IFIH1 genes that play a role in innate immunity, and seroconversion in Black South African infants after vaccination with Rotarix at 6 and 14 weeks of age. Rotavirus-specific IgA antibody titre was measured by ELISA before each vaccine dose and four weeks after the second dose, and seroconversion was defined as a four-fold or greater increase in IgA antibody titre at 18 weeks of age when compared to pre-vaccine titres. A total of 95/138 individuals seroconverted (68.8%) and seroconversion was significantly affected by birthweight (P = 0.010), pre-vaccine IgA and IgG titres (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.007 respectively). rs2159377 SNP in TLR8 was significantly associated with seroconversion in a univariate allelic model (P = 0.015) and was borderline significant in a multivariable logistic regression adjusted for birthweight and pre-vaccine titres (P = 0.071), although these values did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction. A haplotype of six SNPs on the X chromosome across TLR7 and TLR8, including rs179008 and rs5935438 minor alleles, was significantly associated with seroconversion in a univariate model (P = 0.042), but not in a multivariable model or after Bonferroni correction. Epistatic interaction between rs5743305 in TLR3 and rs55789327 in DDX58 was significantly associated with seroconversion (P = 0.034) but a genetic risk score constructed from all 19 minor alleles was not. Our results suggest that TLR variants may influence IgA antibody production and seroconversion to Rotarix vaccine in South Africans. Host genetic variation contributes to the varying immunogenicity of live oral rotavirus vaccines. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Heterologous vaccination using ChAdOx1-S/BNT162b2 elicited higher immunogenicity compared with homologous immunization. BBIBP-CorV/BNT162b2 combination is worth testing. In this pilot prospective cohort study conducted at Makassed General Hospital, Beirut, Lebanon, from February 17, 2021, to June 30, 2021, we tested the safety and immunogenicity of a BNT162b2 booster dose in COVID-19-naive individuals who had received two doses of the BBIBP-CorV vaccine. Heterologous booster vaccination was found to be safe and well tolerated. It was significantly associated with higher anti-spike IgG geometric mean titers compared to that after homologous BNT162b2 immunization in COVID-19-naive individuals [(8040 BAU/mL, 95% confidence interval (CI), 4612-14 016) vs (1384 BAU/mL, 95% CI, 1063-1801), respectively, (P < 0.0001)]. In countries with limited access to mRNA vaccines and where populations have already received BBIBP-CorV, mixing BBIBP-CorV/BNT162b2 is seen to overcome the low immunogenicity induced by BBIBP-CorV alone, thus potentially providing protection against emerging variants.

We surveyed all hospitalized military personnel in the Isareli Defense Forces during the period of the COVID-19 vaccination operation (12/28/2021-3/7/2021) for diagnosed myocarditis. We identified 7 cases of myocarditis with symptoms starting in the first week after the second dose of COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. One case of myocarditis diagnosed 10 days after the second dose of the vaccine was not included. These 8 cases comprise of all events of myocarditis diagnosed in military personnel during this time period. All patients were young and generally healthy. All had mild disease with no sequalae. The incidence of myocarditis in the week following a second dose of the vaccine was 5.07/100,000 people vaccinated. Due to the nature of this report no causality could be established. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of myocarditis following Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination. True incidence rates should be further investigated. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: The QS-21 adjuvanted toxoid vaccine study randomized subjects 3:1 to 100 mu g QS-21-containing C difficile vaccine or placebo administered in a shortened-month (Months 0, 1, 3) or day (Days 1, 8, 30) regimen. The toxoid-alone vaccine study randomized subjects 3:3:1 to receive 100 or 200 mu g unadjuvanted C difficile vaccine formulation or placebo in Stages 1 and 2 (sentinel cohorts of different age groups), and 3:1 to receive the selected dose of unadjuvanted C difficile vaccine formulation or placebo in Stage 3 (Days 1, 8, 30). Safety was the primary outcome for both studies. Immunogenicity was determined by measuring serum toxin A- and B-specific neutralizing antibodies. Results: In the day regimen, 10 reports across both studies of grade 3 injection site redness postdose 2 triggered predefined stopping rules. Local reactions in both studies were more common among vaccine versus placebo recipients. Injection site pain predominated and was generally mild in severity. Systemic events were infrequent and generally mild-to-moderate in severity. Adverse events were reported by 50.0%-75.0% and 16.7%-50.0% of subjects in the QS-21 and toxoid-alone studies, respectively. Immune responses peaked around Day 37 (shortened-month regimen) or between Day 15 and Month 2 (day regimen) and remained above baseline throughout follow-up. Conclusions: Both formulations demonstrated robust immunogenicity. Both studies stopped early due to grade 3 injection site redness postdose 2 of the day regimen; neither formulation progressed to later stage development. Instead, an aluminum hydroxide-containing formulation of the vaccine candidate administered at 0, 1, and 6 months, which was safe and immunogenic in phase 1 and 2 studies, advanced to phase 3 studies.

Cost-effectiveness of strategies for preventing paediatric lower respiratory infections associated with respiratory syncytial virus in eight Chinese cities	VACCINE			English	Article						Respiratory syncytial virus; Acute lower respiratory infection; Maternal immunisation; Monoclonal antibody; Paediatric immunisation; Cost-effectiveness	YOUNG-CHILDREN; HOSPITALIZATIONS	Background: New monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines against RSV with promising efficacy and protection duration are expected to be available in the near future. We evaluated the costeffectiveness of the administration of maternal immunisation (MI), infant mAb (IA) and paediatric immunisation (PI) as well as their combinations in eight Chinese cities. Methods: We used a static model to estimate the impact of these preventive interventions on reducing the burden of RSV-ALRI in twelve monthly birth cohorts from a societal perspective. In addition to year-round administration, we also considered seasonal administration of MI and IA (i.e., administered only to children born in selected months). The primary outcome was threshold strategy cost (TSC), defined as the maximum costs per child for a strategy to be cost-effective. Results: With a willingness-to-pay threshold of one national GDP per capita per QALY gained for all the cities, TSC of year-round strategies was: (i) US$2.4 (95% CI: 1.9-3.4) to US$14.7 (11.6-21.4) for MI; (ii) US $19.9 (16.9-25.9) to US$144.2 (124.6-184.7) for IA; (iii) US$28.7 (22.0-42.0) to US$201.0 (156.5-298.6) for PI; (iv) US$31.1 (24.0-45.5) to US$220.7 (172.0-327.3) for maternal plus paediatric immunisation (MPI); and (v) US$41.3 (32.6-58.9) to US$306.2 (244.1-441.3) for infant mAb plus paediatric immunisation (AP). In all cities, the top ten seasonal strategies (ranked by TSC) protected infants from 5 or fewer monthly birth cohorts. Conclusions: Administration of these interventions could be cost-effective if they are suitably priced. Suitably-timed seasonal administration could be more cost-effective than their year-round counterpart. Our results can inform the optimal strategy once these preventive interventions are commercially available. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yoshikawa, T				Yoshikawa, Tetsushi			Implementing vaccination policies based upon scientific evidence in Japan	VACCINE			English	Review							ROTAVIRUS VACCINATION; VARICELLA VACCINE; PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY; UNITED-STATES; OKA STRAIN; PREVENTION; PROGRAM	The theme of the 24th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Society for Vaccinology was "Sustainable Future Medical Care Created by Vaccines." This theme includes topics such as the proposal to reduce the medical costs incurred by societies with aging populations through prophylactic vaccination. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic alerted us to the important roles that preventive measures, such as vaccines, play in fighting infectious diseases. In order to inform the public of the benefits of vaccines, it is important to provide society with information regarding new vaccine developments, adjuvants, the cost-benefit ratio of vaccine introduction, and vaccine effectiveness and safety. Clinical research is essential for obtaining evidence of vaccine effectiveness and safety. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts active surveillance in defined areas before and after the introduction of vaccines and documents the reduction in infection rates as a measure of vaccine effectiveness. However, vaccine efficacy and side effects may vary by country and ethnicity. Therefore, it is necessary for individual countries to develop their own evidence-based surveillance programs. We have studied vaccine efficacy and documented side-effects observed in patients for the varicella and rotavirus vaccines in Japan. This review outlines the importance of providing scientific evidence for vaccine effectiveness and safety. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wilson, R				Wilson, Rose			HPV vaccine acceptance in West Africa: A systematic literature review	VACCINE			English	Review						HPV; Vaccine Hesitancy; Vaccine acceptance; Literature review; West Africa	HUMAN PAPILLOMA-VIRUS; CERVICAL-CANCER; ADOLESCENT DAUGHTERS; KNOWLEDGE; MOTHERS; ACCEPTABILITY; WILLINGNESS; PERCEPTION; STUDENTS; ATTITUDE	Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are mostly sexually transmitted and cause the greatest share of infection-associated cancers. Each year more than half a million women are diagnosed with cervical can-cer and the mortality rate in West Africa is over ten times higher than that of Northern Europe. HPV vac-cines are highly effective at preventing various strains of the infection. However, vaccine hesitancy and access issues have led to low HPV vaccine acceptance in certain countries. A search strategy was devel-oped in PubMed and included an extensive list of keywords and related MeSH/subject headings to cap -ture the many dimensions and expressions of vaccine access, confidence, trust and hesitancy related to HPV vaccination in West Africa. Thirty-five articles were included by full text. Most studies were con-ducted in Nigeria. Three were conducted in Mali, and one each in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Senegal. The main concerns relating to the vaccine were inadequate information, cost and safety concerns. Several studies also mentioned fertility and promiscuity concerns. Despite over half of West African coun-tries introducing an HPV vaccine pilot project, there is a scarcity of literature on HPV vaccine acceptance in the region. It is important to understand how cultural and gender dynamics in different settings can influence peoples' vaccination decisions. This can be done through in-depth local ethnographies, taking the views of all community members and influencers into account, and complemented by in-depth indi-vidual interviews and focus groups.

Limited evidence is available about the drivers of maternal immunization in middle-income countries such as Peru. Vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria and influenza are recommended beginning in the second trimester in Peru; however, vaccination coverage has remained low in Peru compared to other countries in the region. As additional vaccines are recommended for administration in pregnancy, a better understanding of the perceptions and attitudes of pregnant women that influence vaccination are needed to design communication materials. Methods: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study to understand the individual level factors influencing pregnant women's vaccine uptake. We interviewed pregnant women about their knowledge, perceptions and experiences with vaccination during pregnancy. Community health workers recruited women in a peri urban area of Peru in April 2018. Results: Twelve women were interviewed, the majority of which had received vaccination during the current pregnancy. The most common reasons for vaccination were to protect the baby and because vaccines are effective. Concerns included vaccine safety during pregnancy and adverse effects on the unborn baby. Some women mentioned that because vaccines are given later in pregnancy, the unborn baby is stronger, so vaccines will not harm them. Women highlighted that the main reason for not being vaccinated was lack of information. They also noted that they were the decision-maker in whether or not they were vaccinated. Most women said that they trusted healthcare providers and that trust was linked to providing information through open communication. Conclusions: Overall, participants were supportive of maternal vaccination. They believed that vaccines were effective in protecting both their unborn baby and themselves. The main reason given for non-vaccination was lack of knowledge about vaccination in pregnancy. The strong desire expressed by study participants to get more information presents an opportunity for immunization programs to develop interventions that facilitate better information dissemination to pregnant women to increase vaccination uptake.

J	Raghunandan, R; Higgins, D; Hosken, N				Raghunandan, Rama; Higgins, Deborah; Hosken, Nancy			RSV neutralization assays - Use in immune response assessment	VACCINE			English	Review						Respiratory syncytial virus; Neutralization; International standard; Antibody responses; Vaccine; Assay	SYNCYTIAL VIRUS RSV; PLAQUE-ASSAY; F-PROTEIN; ANTIBODY; COMPLEMENT; PARTICLES	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of respiratory illness among children and infants worldwide, yet no licensed vaccine exists to reduce the risk of disease. At least 16 RSV vaccine candidates are currently in clinical development and many are designed to induce robust virus neutralizing immune responses. RSV neutralizing antibody (nAb)-mediated interventions such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and palivizumab provide passive protection against serious lower respiratory tract disease due to RSV, validating nAbs as a correlate of protection. To identify correlates of protection for vaccine candidates that have demonstrated their protective efficacy, an investigator can use assays designed to measure nAb responses. However, there is no standard method of measurement; individual laboratories have developed their own methods to measure the ability of nAbs to reduce the infectivity of a defined virus dose in a variety of cell lines, leading to establishment of the broad variety of RSV neutralization assay formats currently in use. Standardizing the RSV neutralization assay is an essential step toward better assessment of nAb responses to vaccine candidates. Use of a common reference standard by all makes comparing the immunogenicity of different vaccine candidates feasible. In the context of vaccine development, the WHO 1st International Standard for Antiserum to RSV (RSV IS) has been shown to be suitable for harmonizing results across laboratories and assay formats used to measure nAb titers to RSV/A and RSV/B in human sera. This review describes the broad variety of RSV virus neutralization assay formats currently in use and the importance of the RSV IS for harmonization of results across formats and across laboratories. It also outlines good practices for key assay components and data analysis to promote the quality and consistency of measuring RSV nAb titers in serum specimens. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: We employed a test negative case-control study, utilising a recent measles outbreak during which many healthcare workers received the MMR vaccine, to investigate the potential protective effect of MMR against SARS-CoV-2 in 5905 subjects (n = 805 males, n = 5100 females). Results: The odds ratio for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, in recently MMR-vaccinated compared to not recently MMR-vaccinated individuals was 0.91 (95% CI 0.76, 1.09). An interaction analysis showed a significant interaction for sex. After sex-stratification, the odds ratio for testing positive for males was 0.43 (95% CI 0.24, 0.79, P = 0.006), and 1.01 (95% CI 0.83, 1.22, P = 0.92) for females. Conclusion: Our results indicate that there may be a protective effect of the MMR vaccine against SARSCoV-2 in males but not females. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, three inactivated EV71 vaccines have been approved by Chinese government. We previously demonstrated that recombinant EV71 virus-like particles (VLP) produced in Pichia pastoris can be produced at a high yield with a simple manufacturing process, and the candidate vaccine elicited protective humoral immune responses in mice. In present study, the nonclinical immunogenicity, efficacy and toxicity of the EV71 vaccine was comprehensively evaluated in rodents and non-human primates. The immunogenicity assessment showed that EV71 VLPs vaccine elicited high and persistent neutralizing antibody responses, which could be comparable with a licensed inactivated vaccine in animals. The immune sera of vaccinated mice also exhibited cross-neutralization activities to the heterologous subtypes of EV71. Both passive and maternal antigen specific antibodies protected the neonatal mice against the lethal EV71 challenge. Furthermore, nonclinical safety assessment of EV71 VLP vaccine showed no signs of systemic toxicity in animals. Therefore, the excellent immunogenicity, efficacy and toxicology data supported further evaluation of the VLP-based EV71 vaccine in humans. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Tetanus vaccine, also known as tetanus toxoid, is the only vaccine given to pregnant women in The Gambia and Senegal, where it is given by antenatal care providers as part of the Expanded Programme on Immunization. A qualitative study was undertaken to explore factors influencing acceptance of vaccination during pregnancy in The Gambia and Senegal. Methods: Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted across urban and rural settlements of The Gambia and Senegal. We explored the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of 152 women who were either pregnant or with an infant. NVivo 11 Qualitative Data Analysis Software was used for management and thematic analysis of the data. Results: Women had sufficient knowledge of the need for tetanus vaccine from different information sources but insufficient knowledge of tetanus causes, signs and symptoms. Tetanus vaccine was perceived to be safe and side effects such as pain and swelling at site of injection did not deter uptake of future doses. Women overall had confidence in their sources of vaccine information and the health care workers who administered maternal vaccinations. Their willingness to accept vaccination during pregnancy was particularly influenced by their husbands and trusted healthcare workers. Women across all sites mentioned they would accept new maternal vaccines if they are sensitized beforehand about any potential risks and benefits to them and their babies. Conclusion: Vaccine acceptance can be influenced by several factors including contextual, individual or group influences and vaccine or vaccination-specific issues. Women across The Gambia and Senegal are generally vaccine acceptors with confidence in the health care workers who vaccinate them and few concerns about maternal vaccines. Women's acceptance of vaccination during pregnancy is based on previous vaccination experiences and individual weighing of risks and benefits. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

An early look at the second dose completion of the recombinant zoster vaccine in Canadian adults: A retrospective database study	VACCINE			English	Article						Recombinant zoster vaccine; Herpes zoster; Longitudinal Prescription Database; Canadian National Advisory Committee on; Immunization	HERPES-ZOSTER; SUBUNIT VACCINE; EFFICACY	Background: In 2017, the two-dose recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) was authorized for use in Canada for the prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) in adults > 50 years of age (YOA), which is administered 2- 6 months apart. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) states that a 0, 12-month schedule may be considered if flexibility in the timing of the second dose is needed to improve coverage. This retrospective database study evaluated the second-dose completion of RZV in Canada from January 2018 to May 2019. Methods: Data were obtained from the IQVIA LRx Longitudinal Prescription Database which tracks retail prescriptions of anonymized patients. Patients were followed for 6-or 12-months to evaluate the second dose completion aligned with the licensed RZV dosing schedule and NACI's option for greater flexibility. The primary outcomes were time from first to second dose and the proportion of patients who received the second dose. Results: In the 6-month (155,747 patients) and 12-month (55,524 patients) analytic cohorts, 65.0% and 74.9% received the second RZV dose within 2-6 months and 2-12 months after the first dose with a truncated mean time of 97.8 days and 109.8 days between doses, respectively. Variation in completion rates was observed across age and geography, but sex, rurality, and pharmacy type did not impact results. Conclusion: Second dose completion of RZV in Canada is high but suboptimal. Further research to understand the factors influencing second dose timing and completion will be an important next step to improve series completion. (c) 2021 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA.

We assessed antimicrobial susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) obtained from a national surveillance system for invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) before/after PCV10 intro-duction. Methods: Antimicrobial non-susceptible isolates were defined as intermediate or resistant. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to penicillin and ceftriaxone were analyzed by year. Antimicrobial sus-ceptibility rates were assessed for each three-year-period using the pre-PCV10-period as reference. Susceptibility of vaccine-types was evaluated for 2017-2019. Results: 11,380 isolates were studied. Spn with penicillin > 0.125 mg/L and ceftriaxone > 1.0 mg/L decreased in the three-years after PCV10 introduction (2011-2013: penicillin, 28.1-22.5%; ceftriaxone, 11.3%-7.6%) versus pre-PCV10-years (2007-2009: penicillin, 33.8-38.1%; ceftriaxone, 17.2%-15.6%). After 2013, the proportion of Spn with those MICs to penicillin and ceftriaxone increased to 39.4% and 19.7% in 2019, respectively. Non-susceptibility to penicillin and ceftriaxone increased in 2014-2016, and again in 2017-2019 especially among children < 5 years with meningitis (penicillin, 53.9%; ceftriax-one, 28.0%); multidrug-resistance reached 25% in 2017-2019. Serotypes 19A, 6C and 23A were most asso-ciated with antimicrobial non-susceptibility. Conclusions: Antimicrobial non-susceptible Spn decreased in the three-years after vaccination but subse-quently increased and was associated with non-PCV10-types. Antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance is fundamental for guiding antibiotic therapy policies. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Brandileone, Maria-Cristina C.; Almeida, Samanta C.

Rotavirus disease and health care utilisation among children under 5 years of age in highly developed countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis	VACCINE			English	Review						Rotavirus; Gastroenteritis; Health care use; Mortality; Systematic review	HOSPITAL-BASED SURVEILLANCE; ACUTE GASTROENTERITIS; VIRAL GASTROENTERITIS; NEW-ZEALAND; BURDEN; VACCINATION; INFECTIONS; IMPACT; DIARRHEA; PREVALENCE	Background: Rotavirus (RV) infection is the leading cause of diarrhoea-associated morbidity and mortality globally among children under 5 years of age. RV vaccination is available, but has not been implemented in many national immunisation plans, especially in highly developed countries. This systematic review aimed to estimate the prevalence and incidence of health care use for RV gastroenteri-tis (RVGE) among children aged under 5 years in highly developed countries without routine RV vaccination. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and Embase databases from January 1st 2000 to December 17th 2018 for publications reporting on incidence or prevalence of RVGE-related health care use in children below 5 years of age: primary care and emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalisations, nosocomial infections and deaths. We included only studies with laboratory-confirmed RV infection, undertaken in highly developed countries with no RV routine vaccination plans. We used random effects meta-analysis to generate summary estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and prediction intervals. Results: We screened 4033 abstracts and included 74 studies from 21 countries. Average incidence rates of RVGE per 100 000 person-years were: 2484 (95% CI 697-5366) primary care visits, 1890 (1597-2207) ED visits, 500 (422-584) hospitalisations, 34 (20-51) nosocomial infections and 0.04 (0.02-0.07) deaths. Average proportions of cases of acute gastroenteritis caused by RV were: 21% (95% CI 16-26%) for primary care visits; 32% (25-38%) for ED visits; 41% (36-47%) for hospitalisations, 29% (25-34%) for nosocomial infections and 12% (8-18%) for deaths. Results varied widely between and within countries, and heterogeneity was high (I-2 > 90%) in most models. Conclusion: RV in children under 5 years causes many healthcare visits and hospitalisations, with low mortality, in highly developed countries without routine RV vaccination. The health care use estimates for RVGE obtained by this study can be used to model RV vaccine cost-effectiveness in highly developed countries. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Knowledge of associated economic costs is important for policymakers to determine cost-effectiveness of interventions, such as pneumococcal or influenza vaccines, which are underused in Malaysia. Methods: Children < 5 years admitted with ARI to a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur were prospectively recruited between July 2013 and July 2015. Medical (with and without government subsidies), nonmedical and indirect costs from pre-admission, admission and post-discharge were obtained by interviews with carers and from medical records. Respiratory viruses were diagnosed by immunofluorescence and virus culture. Results: 200 patients were recruited, and 74 (37%) had respiratory viruses detected. For each admitted ARI, the median direct out-of-pocket cost (subsidized) was USD 189 (interquartile range, 140-258), representing a median 16.4% (10.4-22.3%) of reported monthly household income. The median total direct cost (unsubsidized) was USD 756 (564-987), meaning that government subsidies covered a median 75.2% (70.2-78.4%) of actual costs. Median direct costs for 50 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases were higher than the 126 virus-negative cases (USD 803 vs 729, p = 0.03). The median societal cost (combining direct and indirect costs) was USD 871 (653-1,183), which is 1.8 times the Malaysian health expenditure per capita in 2014. Costs were higher with younger age, presence of comorbidity, prematurity, and detection of a respiratory virus. Conclusion: These comprehensive estimated costs of ARI admissions in children < 5 years are high. These costs can be used as a basis for planning treatment and preventive strategies, including cost-effectiveness studies for influenza and, in future, RSV vaccines. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Variable immunogenicity of a vivax malaria blood-stage vaccine candidate	VACCINE			English	Article						Plasmodium vivax; Malaria; Memory B cells; Sex as a biological variable; Vaccine	DUFFY-BINDING-PROTEIN; PLASMODIUM-VIVAX; INHIBITORY ANTIBODIES; PROTECTION; EPITOPES; RECEPTOR; MICE; IDENTIFICATION; FRAGMENT; ANTIGENS	Relapsing malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax is a neglected tropical disease and an important cause of malaria worldwide. Vaccines to prevent clinical disease and mosquito transmission of vivax malaria are needed to overcome the distinct challenges of this important public health problem. In this vaccine immunogenicity study in mice, we examined key variables of responses to a P. vivax Duffy binding protein vaccine, a leading candidate to prevent the disease-causing blood-stages. Significant sex-dependent differences were observed in B cell (CD80+) and T cell (CD8+) central memory subsets, resulting in significant differences in functional immunogenicity and durability of anti-DBP protective efficacy. These significant sex-dependent differences in inbred mice were in the CD73+CD80+ memory B cell, H2KhiCD38hi/lo, and effector memory subsets. This study highlights sex and immune genes as critical variables that can impact host responses to P. vivax antigens and must be taken into consideration when designing clinical vaccine studies.

Projecting the impact of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Ontario, Canada	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Vaccination; Outbreak simulation	DYNAMICS; SPREAD	Background: A number of highly effective COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and approved for mass vaccination. We evaluated the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 outbreak and disease outcomes in Ontario, Canada. Methods: We used an agent-based transmission model and parameterized it with COVID-19 characteristics, demographics of Ontario, and age-specific clinical outcomes. We implemented a two-dose vaccination program according to tested schedules in clinical trials for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, prioritizing healthcare workers, individuals with comorbidities, and those aged 65 and older. Daily vaccination rate was parameterized based on vaccine administration data. Using estimates of vaccine efficacy, we projected the impact of vaccination on the overall attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths. We further investigated the effect of increased daily contacts at different stages during vaccination campaigns on outbreak control. Results: Maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) with an average of 74% reduction in daily contacts, vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was projected to reduce hospitalizations by 27.3% (95% CrI: 22.3% - 32.4%) and 27.0% (95% CrI: 21.9% - 32.6%), respectively, over a oneyear time horizon. The largest benefits of vaccination were observed in preventing deaths with reductions of 31.5% (95% CrI: 22.5% - 39.7%) and 31.9% (95% CrI: 22.0% - 41.4%) for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, compared to no vaccination. We found that an increase of only 10% in daily contacts at the end of lockdown, when vaccination coverage with only one dose was 6%, would trigger a surge in the outbreak. Early relaxation of population-wide measures could lead to a substantial increase in the number of infections, potentially reaching levels observed during the peak of the second wave in Ontario. Conclusions: Vaccination can substantially mitigate ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks. Sustaining populationwide NPIs, to allow for a sufficient increase in population-level immunity through vaccination, is essential to prevent future outbreaks. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

J	Wentzell, E; Racila, AM				Wentzell, Emily; Racila, Ana-Monica			The social experience of participation in a COVID-19 vaccine trial: Subjects' motivations, others' concerns, and insights for vaccine promotion	VACCINE			English	Article						Covid-19; Vaccine uptake; Vaccine hesitancy; Clinical trial; Qualitative research	HESITANCY	Background: Vaccine hesitancy could undermine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination programs. Knowledge about people's lived experiences regarding COVID-19 vaccination can enhance vaccine promotion and increase uptake. Aim: To use COVID-19 vaccine trial participants' experiences to identify key themes in the lived experience of vaccination early in the vaccine approval and distribution process. Methods: We interviewed 31 participants in the Iowa City, Iowa US site of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine phase 3 clinical trial. While trial participation differs from clinical receipt of an approved vaccine in key ways, it offers the first view of people's lived experiences of potentially receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial context is also useful since decision-making about vaccination and medical research participation often involve similar hopes and concerns, and because the public appears to view even approved COVID-19 vaccines as experimental given their novelty. Semi-structured interviews addressed subjects' experiences, including decision-making and telling others about their trial participation. We analyzed verbatim transcripts of these interviews thematically and identified common themes relevant for vaccination decision-making. Results: Participants across demographic groups, including age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation, described largely similar experiences. Key motivations for participation included ending the pandemic/restoring normalcy, protecting oneself and others, doing one's duty, promoting/modeling vaccination, and expressing aspects of identity like being a helper, career-related motivations, and support of science/vaccines. Participants often felt uniquely qualified to help via trial participation due to personal attributes like health, sex/gender or race/ethnicity. They reported hearing concerns about side effects and the speed and politicization of vaccine development. Participants responded by normalizing and contextualizing side effects, de-politicizing vaccine development, and explaining how the rapid development process was nevertheless safe. Conclusion: These findings regarding participants' reported motivations for trial participation and interactions with concerned others can be incorporated into COVID-19 vaccine promotion messaging aimed at similar populations.

The estimated HBsAg prevalence in the Philippines among adults was 16.7% during the pre-vaccine era. We estimated the HBsAg seroprevalence among children aged 5-7 years to measure the impact of vaccination. We conducted a household serosurvey, using a three-stage cluster survey methodology (provinces, clusters, and households). We estimated HBsAg prevalence using a rapid, point-of-care HBsAg test and calculated vaccination coverage by reviewing vaccination records or by caregiver recall. A questionnaire was administered to assess demographic variables for the child and family. We assessed the association between chronic HBV infection, vaccination coverage, and demographic variables, accounting for the complex survey design. Of the 2178 children tested, HBsAg was detected in 15 children [0.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4, 1.7]. Only two of the HBsAg-positive children had been fully vaccinated against HBV. Based on documented vaccination or caregiver recall for the survey population, hepatitis B vaccine birth dose (HepBBD) coverage was 53%, and the third dose hepatitis B vaccination (HepB3) coverage was 73 percent. Among the 1362 children with documented HepB-BD, timely HepB-BD coverage (given within 24 h of birth) was 43%; children born outside a health facility were less likely to receive a timely HepB-BD than those born in a health facility (adjusted odds ratio 0.10, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.23). HBsAg prevalence among children in the Philippines has decreased compared to the prevalence among adults in the pre-vaccination era. Strategies to further reduce HBsAg prevalence include ensuring that all children, whether born in health facilities or at home, receive a timely HepB-BD, and increasing HepB-BD and HepB3 coverage to reach the WPR goals of >95% coverage.

It is associated with severe neurological complications and death. This study aims to develop a live-attenuated vaccine by codon deoptimization (CD) and codon-pair deoptimization (CPD) of EV-A71. CD is generated by introducing the least preferred codons for amino acids while CPD increases the presence of underrepresented codon pairs in the specific genes. CD and CPD chimeras were generated by synonymous mutations at the VP2, VP3, VP1 and 2A gene regions, designated as XYZ. All twelve deoptimized viruses were viable with similar replication kinetics, but the plaque sizes were inversely proportional to the level of deoptimization. All the deoptimized viruses showed attenuated growth in vitro with reduced viral protein expression at 48 h and lower viral RNA at 39 degrees C. Six-week-old ICR mice were immunized intraperitoneally with selected CD and CPD X and XY vaccine candidates covering the VP2-VP3 and VP2-VP3-VP1 genes, respectively. All vaccine candidates elicited high anti-EV-A71 IgG levels similar to wild-type (WT) EV-A71. The CD X and CPD X vaccines produced robust neutralizing antibodies but not the CD XY and CPD XY. On lethal challenge, offspring of mice immunized with WT, CD X and CPD X were fully protected, but the CD XY- and CPD XY-vaccinated mice had delayed symptoms and eventually died. Similarly, active immunization of 1-day-old suckling mice with CD X, CPD X and CD XY vaccine candidates provided complete immune protection but CPD XY only protected 40% of the challenged mice. Histology of the muscles from CD X- and CPD X-vaccinated mice showed minimal pathology compared to extensive inflammation in the post-challenged mock-vaccinated mice. Overall, we demonstrated that the CD X and CPD X elicited good neutralizing antibodies, conferred immune protection and are promising live-attenuated vaccine candidates for EV-A71.

However, because of the weak immunogenicity of peptides in subunit vaccines, it is difficult to trigger an effective cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, which is critical for cancer therapy. A requirement for the activation of CTL cells by exogenous antigens is the stimulation of antigen presenting cells (APC) with the help of adjuvants and cross-presentation to T lymphocytes. Standard nonconjugated adjuvant-peptide mixtures do not ensure co-targeting of the antigen and the adjuvant to the same APC, which limits the effects of adjuvants. In this study, a fusion protein consisting of murine granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor (mGM-CSF) fused with CTA2 (A2 subunit of cholera toxin) was generated and assembled with CTB-PSMA624-632 (prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) peptide 624-632 fused to CTB) to obtain a cholera toxin-like protein. The chimeric protein retained the biological activity of mGM-CSF and had stronger GM1 binding activity than (CTB-PSMA624-632)5. C57BL/6J mice immunized with the CT-like chimeric protein exhibited delayed tumor growth following challenge with human PSMA-EGFP-expressing RM-1 cells. Experiment results showed that the CT-like chimeric protein could induce the maturation of DC cells and improve CTL responses. Overall, these results indicate that the nasal administration of a CT-like chimeric protein vaccine results in the development of effective immunity against prostate tumor cells and might be useful for future clinical anti-tumoral applications.

Preclinical in vitro and in vivo profile of a highly-attenuated, broadly efficacious pneumolysin genetic toxoid	VACCINE			English	Article						Streptococcus pneumoniae; Serotype-independent pneumococcal vaccine; Universal pneumococcal vaccine; Pneumolysin; Serotype replacement; Mouse model		Pneumolysin is a highly conserved, cholesterol-dependent cytolysin that is an important Streptococcus pneumoniae virulence factor and an attractive target for vaccine development. To attenuate pneumolysin toxicity, a genetic toxoid was constructed with two amino acid changes, G293S and L460D, termed PLY-D, that reduced cytolytic activity > 125,000-fold. In mice, PLY-D elicited high anti-PLY IgG antibody titers that neutralized the cytolytic activity of the wild-type toxin in vitro. To evaluate the protective efficacy of PLY-D, mice were immunized intramuscularly and then challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of 28 clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae originating from different geographical locations, disease states (i.e. bacteremia, pneumonia), or body sites (i.e. sputum, blood). PLY-D immunization conferred significant protection from challenge with 17 of 20 serotypes (85%) and 22 of 28 strains (79%). Further, we demonstrated that immunization with PLY-D provided statistically significant improvement in survival against challenge with serotype 4 and 18C strains compared to mice immunized with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevnar 13 (R) (PCV13). Co-administration of PLY-D and PCV13 conferred greater protection against challenge with a serotype 6B strain than immunization with either vaccine alone. These data indicate that PLY-D is a broadly protective antigen with the potential to serve as a serotype-independent vaccine against invasive pneumococcal disease either alone or in combination with PCVs.

This study aimed to determine the potential relationships between age and vaccine coverage and between multiple phenotype-genotype characteristics of S. pneumoniae isolated from children. Methods: All S. pneumoniae isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, virulence genes, serotypes, and sequence types. The restricted cubic spline models were used to reveal potential relationships between children age and pneumococcal vaccine coverage. Results: For capsular-based vaccines, we observed a high coverage rate of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13, 85.8%) and a significantly non-linear relationship between children age and vaccine coverage (including PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13), with marked fluctuations in children aged < 2 years. For protein-based and pilus-based vaccine candidates, we demonstrated dynamic non-linear relationships between age and vaccine coverage, maintaining a stable and high coverage rate of ply and lytA for all age groups. Moreover, there were significantly high-dimensional corresponding relationships among multiple phenotype-genotype characteristics of S. pneumoniae isolates (such as ST271 associated with serotype 19F, PI-2, and extensively drug-resistance). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the age for high PCV coverage being children aged >= 2 years and also provide important evidence for supporting ply and lytA as priority candidate targets for the development of new-generation protein vaccines.

Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the only available vaccine against TB but its efficacy varies throughout the world. Subunit vaccine candidates, based on recombinant viral vectors expressing mycobacterial antigens, are one of the strategies being developed to boost BCG-primed host immune responses and efficacy. A promising vaccination regimen composed of intradermal (i.d.) BCG prime, followed by intranasally (i.n.) administered chimpanzee adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1) and i.n. or i.d. modified vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA), both expressing Ag85A, has been previously reported to significantly improve BCG efficacy in mice. Effector and memory immune responses induced by BCG-ChAdOx1.85A-MVA85A (B-C-M), were evaluated to identify immune correlates of protection in mice. This protective regime induced strong Ag85A-specific cytokine responses in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, both in the systemic and pulmonary compartments. Lung parenchymal CXCR3(+) KLRG1(-) Ag85A-specific memory CD4(+) T cells were significantly increased in B-C-M compared to BCG immunised mice at 4, 8 and 20 weeks post vaccination, but the number of these cells decreased at the latter time point. This cell population was associated with the protective efficacy of this regime and may have an important protective role against M.tb infection. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Low dose recombinant full-length circumsporozoite protein-based Plasmodium falciparum vaccine is well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in phase 1 first-in-human clinical testing	VACCINE			English	Article						Malaria; Plasmodium falciparum; Malaria vaccine; Circumsporozoite protein		Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is a major sporozoite surface protein and a key target of pre-erythrocytic malaria subunit vaccines. A full-length recombinant CSP (rCSP) based strategy could be advantageous, as this antigen includes a region critical to sporozoite cell attachment and hepatocyte invasion. The adjuvant Glucopyranosyl Lipid A-liposome Quillaja saponaria 21 (GLA-LSQ) functions as a TLR4 agonist, promotes antigen-specific T(H)1 responses and stimulates cytotoxic T cell production. To date, one study has reported the clinical acceptability of GLA-LSQ. We present interim results of a phase 1 first-in-human dose-escalation clinical trial of full-length rCSP vaccine given with or without GLA-LSQ adjuvant. Participants experienced only mild to moderate related solicited adverse events. The lowest adjuvanted vaccine dose achieved >90-fold rise in geometric mean anti-CSP IgG antibody titer. These favorable safety and immunogenicity results confirm the immunostimulatory capacity of this relatively new adjuvant and support next steps in clinical product development. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Short term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on incidence of vaccine preventable diseases and participation in routine infant vaccinations in the Netherlands in the period March-September 2020	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine-preventable diseases; VPDs; Routine infant vaccination		We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) and participation in the routine infant vaccination programme in the Netherlands. The incidence of various VPDs initially decreased by 75-97% after the implementation of the Dutch COVID-19 response measures. The participation in the first measles-mumps-rubella vaccination among children scheduled for vaccination in March-September 2020 initially dropped by 6-14% compared with the previous year. After catch-up vaccination, a difference in MMR1 participation of -1% to -2% still remained.

In previous work, a DNA plasmid that encodes a secreted form of BoHV-1 glycoprotein D (pCIgD) together with commercial adjuvants provided partial protection against viral challenge of bovines. In this work, we evaluate new molecules that could potentiate the DNA vaccine. We show that a plasmid encoding a soluble CD40 ligand (CD40L) and the adjuvant Montanide (TM) GEL01 (GEL01) activate in vitro bovine afferent lymph dendritic cells (ALDCs). CD40L is a co-stimulating molecule, expressed transiently on activated CD4+ T cells and, to a lesser extent, on activated B cells and platelets. The interaction with its receptor, CD40, exerts effects on the presenting cells, triggering responses in the immune system. GEL01 was designed to improve transfection of DNA vaccines. We vaccinated cattle with: pCIgD; pCIgD-GEL01; pCIgD with GEL01 and CD40L plasmid (named pCIgD-CD40L-GEL01) or with pCIneo vaccines. The results show that CD40L plasmid with GEL01 improved the pCIgD DNA vaccine, increasing anti-BoHV-1 total IgGs, IgG1, IgG2 subclasses, and neutralizing antibodies in serum. After viral challenge, bovines vaccinated with pCIgD-GEL01-CD40L showed a significant decrease in viral excretion and clinical score. On the other hand, 80% of animals in group pCIgD-GEL01-CD40L presented specific anti-BoHV-1 IgG1 antibodies in nasal swabs. In addition, PBMCs from pCIgD-CD40L-GEL01 had the highest percentage of animals with a positive lymphoproliferative response against the virus and significant differences in the secretion of IFN gamma and IL-4 by mononuclear cells, indicating the stimulation of the cellular immune response. Overall, the results demonstrate that a plasmid expressing CD40L associated with the adjuvant GEL01 improves the efficacy of a DNA vaccine against BoHV-1. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

WHO-SEAR has set a target for Rubella elimination by 2023. This is the first report of antigenic characterization and genome sequencing of nine RuVs sampled during 1992, 2007-9, and 2015-17 from four Indian states. Comparative analysis of Indian RuVs (2B) with that of global isolates and vaccine strain RA 27/3 (1a) revealed that the observed mutations in structural proteins have no major impact on the 3D structure, function and antigenicity. Indian RuVs formed three major clusters (Pune-1992, Kannur-2009 and Chitradurg-2007) in genome-based phylogeny of global isolates. Neutralizing antibody titers in a panel of serum samples from measles negative cases were significantly higher to the vaccine strain compared to a wild-type 2B isolate (Kannur) with concordance of 91.9%, thereby substantiating the use of current vaccines.

Physicians' recommendations strongly influence its acceptance/refusal. Our study sought to understand the decision processes leading physicians to recommend this vaccine (or not). Methods: Qualitative interviews of French physicians (general practitioners, gynecologists, and pediatricians). We first randomly selected doctors in a national register of medical professionals and then resorted to snowballing to build a convenience sample. We coded the interviews in a thematic analysis built both inductively and deductively from our research questions and data. Results: Two thirds of the participants (19/28) were favorable to HPV vaccination, some (4) opposed it, while the others were hesitant about recommending it. In explaining their opinions, most participants mentioned that they trusted the stakeholders within the vaccination system: the less trust they had, the more critical they were of the vaccine and the more importance they attributed to patients' opinions. We identified three different ways they interacted with patients on this topic: informing and convincing; adapting to patients' opinions; refusing compromise about vaccination. Crossing these various themes, we found 5 types of physicians: dissidents (mistrustful of the healthcare system and HPV vaccine), hesitant (finding it difficult to make up their minds about this vaccination), laissez-faire (letting patients decide by themselves, but very favorable to HPV vaccination), educator (very favorable), and uncompromising vaccinators (refusing debate). Pediatricians were overrepresented among the latter two types. Conclusions: Physicians' judgment was influenced by their trust in the stakeholders involved in designing and implementing the HPV vaccination strategy. In this sense, doctors did not differ substantially from laypeople. They were, nonetheless, strongly influenced by their professional style and ethos. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It has been suggested to be able to exert a non-specific beneficial effect as protection against other infectious diseases. The duration of protection against tuberculosis is estimated to be from 10 to 15 years, but the duration of the protection against other infections is not known, maybe up to 20 years, maybe much shorter than that. We don't know it for sure. BCG induced trained immunity paradigm is based on experimental models, cohort studies with low number of individuals, and some epidemiological data in which other possible interfering factors are not controlled. The titles and scopes of scientific articles should be cautiously considered as they can promote indications of getting vaccinated or revaccinated with BCG, before its effectiveness is confirmed and recommendations are published. Besides, revaccination with BCG can put at serious risk patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency. Maybe BCG vaccine is effective in preventing COVID-19 deaths or reducing its severity, but may the effect of this vaccine be relevant even with poor health politics and assistance? It is very difficult to compare the epidemiologic data about COVID-19 in different countries. There are countless factors, mainly social and related to the healthcare system, which can be more decisive than the hypothesis of trained immunity induced by BCG. Until now, we can say that BCG's protective role is, at least, insufficient, given many other factors that corroborate SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or its severity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Immunogenicity and safety of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine-naive and previously immunized adult patients with severe chronic kidney disease	VACCINE			English	Article						13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine; Immunization; Chronic kidney disease; Serotype-specific pneumococcal antibody; Indigenous	CAPSULAR POLYSACCHARIDE; ANTIBODY; OLDER; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PNEUMONIA; CARRIAGE; CHILDREN; IMPACT; SERUM	Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk of pneumococcal infections and recommended to receive the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23). Although the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) has been found to have higher immunogenicity compared to PPV23 in adults with some immunocompromising conditions, previous PPV23 immunization may decrease the immunogenicity of PCV13. We assessed immunogenicity and safety of PCV13 in 74 PPV23-naive and 58 previously PPV23-immunized (>1 year ago) patients with severe (stage 4-5) CKD. Serum IgG, IgM, and IgA specific to seven serotypes, i.e. 3, 6B, 9V, 14, 19A, 19F, 23F were quantified pre- and 4 weeks and one year post-immunization. Baseline concentrations for most serotype-specific IgG and IgM, and serotype 3-specific IgA were higher in previously PPV23-immunized compared to PPV23-naive patients. Immunization with PCV13 significantly increased almost all serotype-specific IgG, all IgA and some IgM; an increase in some serotype-specific IgG and IgM lasted for one year. Fold increases in antibody concentrations and the proportion of individuals with >2-fold increase post-immunization were generally larger in PPV23-naive than previously immunized patients for most serotype-specific IgG and some IgA. The data show that in patients with CKD who received previous PPV23 immunization over one year ago, the antibody response to PCV13 was inferior compared to pneumococcal vaccine naive study participants. In both groups, the lowest response to PCV13 was found for serotype 3. Patients of Indigenous ethnic background demonstrated a superior immune response to PCV13 compared to the non-Indigenous counterpart that could partially be related to Indigenous study participants' younger age. Although we found that previous PPV23 immunization could contribute to the more frequent occurrence of systemic adverse events post PCV13 immunization, those did not exceed the mild to moderate range.

Modeling the cost-effectiveness of maternal acellular pertussis immunization (aP) in different socioeconomic settings: A dynamic transmission model of pertussis in three Brazilian states	VACCINE			English	Article						Pertussis; Maternal immunization; Dynamic transmission models; Cost-effectiveness analysis	VACCINATION COVERAGE; GLOBAL BURDEN; EPIDEMIOLOGY; IMMUNITY; DISEASE; RESURGENCE; DEATHS; IMPACT; COUGH	Objectives: Using dynamic transmission models we evaluated the health and cost outcomes of adding acellular pertussis (aP) vaccination of pregnant women to infant vaccination in three Brazilian states that represent different socioeconomic conditions. The primary objective was to determine whether the same model structure could be used to represent pertussis disease dynamics in differing socioeconomic conditions. Methods: We tested three model structures (SIR, SIRS, SIRSIs) to represent population-level transmission in three socio-demographically distinct Brazilian states: Sao Paulo, Parana and Bahia. Two strategies were evaluated: infant wP vaccination alone versus maternal aP immunization plus infant wP vaccination. Model projections for 2014-2029 include outpatient and inpatient pertussis cases, pertussis deaths, years of life lost, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost, and costs (in 2014 USD) of maternal aP vaccination, infant vaccination, and pertussis medical treatment. Incremental cost per DALY averted is presented from the perspective of the Brazilian National Health System. Results: Based on goodness-of-fit statistics, the SIRSIs model fit best, although it had only a modest improvement in statistical quantitative assessments relative to the SIRS model. For all three Brazilian states, maternal aP immunization led to higher costs but also saved infant lives and averted DALYs. The 2014 USD cost/DALY averted was $3068 in Sao Paulo, $2962 in Parana, and $2022 in Bahia. These results were robust in sensitivity analyses with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios exceeding per capita gross regional product only when the probability that a pertussis case is reported was assumed higher than base case implying more overt cases and deaths and therefore more medical costs. Conclusions: The same model structure fit all three states best, supporting the idea that the disease behaves similarly across different socioeconomic conditions. We also found that immunization of pregnant women with aP is cost-effective in diverse Brazilian states. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Rationale and design of a double-blind randomized non-inferiority clinical trial to evaluate one or two doses of vaccine against human papillomavirus including an epidemiologic survey to estimate vaccine efficacy: The Costa Rica ESCUDDO trial	VACCINE			English	Article						Prophylactic HPV vaccine; HPV infection; HPV antibodies; Single-dose; Cervical cancer prevention	INFECTION	HPV vaccination of adolescent girls is the most effective measure to prevent cervical cancer. The World Health Organization recommends that adolescent girls receive two doses of vaccine but only a small proportion of girls from regions with the highest disease burden are vaccinated because of cost and logistical considerations. Our Costa Rica HPV Vaccine trial suggested that one dose of the bivalent HPV vaccine provides robust and lasting protection against persistent HPV infections for over a decade. Data from a postlicensure trial of the quadrivalent vaccine in India also suggested that a single dose may be effective in reducing cervical cancer risk. To formally compare one versus two doses of the bivalent and nonavalent HPV vaccines, we implemented a large, randomized, double-blind trial to investigate the non-inferiority of one compared to two vaccine doses in the prevention of new HPV16/18 infections that persist 6 or more months. Bivalent and nonavalent vaccines will be evaluated separately. The trial enrolled and randomized (1:1:1:1 to 1-and 2-dose arms of the bivalent and nonavalent vaccines) 20,330 girls 12 to 16 years old residing in Costa Rica. Trial participants are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years. We also aim to estimate vaccine efficacy by comparing the rates of 6 month persistent infection in unvaccinated women with the rates in the follow-up visits of trial participants. We included one survey of unvaccinated women at the start of the study (N = 4452) and will include another survey concomitant with follow up visits of trial participants at year 4.5 (planned N = 3000). Survey participants attend two visits 6 months appart. Herein, we present the rationale, design, and enrolled study population of the ESCUDDO trial.

The I. scapularis salivary components that contribute to tick immunity are likely multifactorial. An anticoagulant that inhibits factor Xa, named Salp14, is present in tick saliva and is associated with partial tick immunity. A tick bite naturally releases tick saliva proteins into the vertebrate host for several days, which suggests that the mode of antigen delivery may influence the genesis of tick immunity. We therefore utilized Salp14 as a model antigen to examine tick immunity using mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), plasmid DNA, or recombinant protein platforms. salp14 containing mRNA-LNPs vaccination elicited erythema at the tick bite site after tick challenge that occurred earlier, and that was more pronounced, compared with DNA or protein immunizations. Humoral and cellular responses associated with tick immunity were directed towards a 25 amino acid region of Salp14 at the carboxy terminus of the protein, as determined by antibody responses and skin-testing assays. This study demonstrates that the model of antigen delivery, also known as the vaccine platform, can influence the genesis of tick immunity in guinea pigs. mRNA-LNPs may be useful in helping to elicit erythema at the tick bite site, one of the most important early hallmarks of acquired tick resistance. mRNA-LNPs containing tick genes is a useful platform for the development of vaccines that can potentially prevent selected tick-borne diseases.

We demonstrated that the TPIV/TLAV prime-boost vaccination yielded the highest and most durable neutralizing antibodies and 100% protection to all 4 serotypes of dengue virus in rhesus macaques. This study compares gene transcription, T and B cell responses elicited by these prime-boost combinations in rhesus macaques. This study shows that the TLAV vaccine increased the expression of the innate immune genes, DDX58 and TLR7, IL1A, IL1B, TNF, CXCL8, CXCL10, IRF1, IRF7, and IFNB, more robustly as compared to TDNA and TPIV vaccines. Overall, two doses of TDNA and one dose of TLAV efficiently elicited a T cell IFN gamma response to PrM/E with a comparable magnitude. Compared to TDNA vaccine, the TLAV vaccine elicited additional IFN gamma response to C, NS1, NS3, and NS5. The TPIV vaccine alone produced poor IFNc response; however, the TLAV significantly boosted its IFN gamma response. The T cell response repertoire associated with TPIV/TLAV prime-boost was to both the structural C/PrM/E and NS proteins, and the T cells were multifunctional as the CD4(+) T cells produced IFNc, TNF alpha, and IL2 and the CD8(+) cells produced TNF alpha and IFN gamma. Opposite to the pattern of CMI, the TPIV vaccine alone elicited the highest B-Mem compared to the other two vaccines, which continuously remained as the highest after boosting. In summary, the TDNA and TLAV vaccines elicited a strong T cell response whereas the TPIV vaccine elicited a superior B-Mem. The T cell response of the TPIV vaccine was significantly boosted by the TLAV vaccine. The elevated T cell response may have provided T cell help for a sustained antibody response for TPIV/TLAV vaccines, which is required for a protective immunity against a live virus challenge.

The Pfizer-BioNTech, BNT162b2 vaccine was first offered exclusively to high-risk population, such as medical personnel (including pregnant women). In this study we compare short term outcomes in vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated pregnant women. Methods: In this prospective observational cohort study, vaccinated and non-vaccinated pregnant women were recruited using an online Google forms questionnaire targeting medical groups on Facebook and WhatsApp. A second questionnaire was sent one month after the first one for interim analysis. Our primary outcome was composite complications in vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups, considered any of the following: vaginal bleeding, pregnancy loss, hypertension, gestational diabetes, and preterm birth. Secondary outcomes included: vaccine side effects, diagnosis of COVID-19 since the last questionnaire, prevalence of vaccinated participants, and reasons for refusal to be vaccinated. Results: Overall, 432 women answered the first questionnaire, of which 326 responses were received to the second questionnaire. Vaccination rate increased from 25.5% to 62% within a month. Maternal age, gestational age at enrollment, nulliparity and number of children were similar in both groups. The rate of composite pregnancy complications was similar between vaccinated and non-vaccinated group (15.8% vs 20.1%, p = 0.37), respectively. The risk for COVID-19 infection was significantly lower in the vaccinated group (1.5% vs 6.5%, p = 0.024, Odds Ratio: 4.5, 95% confidence interval 1.19-17.6). Conclusions: mRNA vaccine during pregnancy does not seem to increase the rate of pregnancy complications and is effective in prevention of COVID-19 infection. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A total of 1000 IMID patients were enrolled in this web-based cross-sectional study. A standardised and self-administered survey was designed by members of the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology Steering Committee for Infectious and Endemic diseases and distributed to IMID patients spread across Brazil. Results: Of the 908 (90.8%) respondents eligible for analysis, 744 (81.9%) were willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19. In our multivariable logistic regression model, concurrent malignancy, fibromyalgia, hydroxychloroquine use, and recent corticosteroid pulse therapy were independently associated with higher odds of C19-VH. The short duration of COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials was the main reason for C19-VH. Conclusion: We identified novel characteristics potentially associated with C19-VH among adults with IMID. Greater awareness on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines is needed for both IMID patients and attending physicians. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Access to HPV vaccination in Japan: Increasing social trust to regain vaccine confidence	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine hesitancy; Social trust; Access framework; Cervical cancer	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION; CANCER; CRISIS; TRENDS	Vaccine hesitancy is a growing concern in global public health, and illustrates serious problems arising from loss of social trust. Japan is experiencing a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine crisis that started with a rapid decline in the vaccination rate in 2013 from approximately 70% to less than 1% and lasting for 7 years. We analyze Japan's case of vaccine hesitancy for HPV vaccine, using a framework for examining barriers to access and use of health technologies according to four categories: architecture, availability, affordability, and adoption. Significant problems were identified in the architecture of the decision-making body, public information availability, adoption of evidence in policy-making process, knowledge and confidence among providers, education to the public, and communication with end users. We propose a series of actions to address these barriers. The national government should diversify the advisory committee to include broader scientific evidence and various viewpoints. Municipalities should actively distribute information cooperating with local providers. Professional associations should create an alliance to influence policy makers and deliver education to health care providers and end users. Politicians should integrate opinions from citizens and scientists to implement an up-to-date policy. Civil society should share individual stories from cervical cancer patients and positive experiences of vaccinated girls. Mass media should use more diverse sources of information to report more comprehensive and science-based views. These actions would help build mutual trust among stakeholders, which is required to increase social trust in the HPV vaccine in Japan and thereby regain vaccine confidence and reduce preventable deaths and complications.

COVID-19 vaccine uptake among healthcare workers in the fourth country to authorize BNT162b2 during the first month of rollout	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; BNT162b2; Vaccine uptake; Healthcare workers; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia	INFLUENZA VACCINE; ACCEPTANCE; RISK	Background: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was the fourth country in the world to authorize the BNT162b2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, which it rolled out on December 17, 2020 and first targeted at healthcare workers (HCWs). This study assesses vaccine uptake among this group during the first month of its availability. Methods: A national cross-sectional, pilot-validated, self-administered survey was conducted among HCWs in the KSA between December 27, 2020 and January 3, 2021. The survey included sociodemographic details, previous contact with COVID-19 patients, previous infection with COVID-19, receiving (or registering with the Ministry of Health website to receive) the COVID-19 vaccine, sources of HCWs' information on vaccines, awareness of emerging variants of concern, and anxiety level using the 7 item Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment. A descriptive bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic binary regression analysis were performed. The primary evaluated outcome was vaccine uptake. Results: Of the 1058 participants who completed the survey, 704 (66.5%) were female, and 626 (59.2%) were nurses. Of all the respondents, 352 (33.27%) were enrolled to receive or had already received the vaccine, while 706 (66.73%) had not enrolled. In a bivariate analysis, not enrolling for vaccination was more likely in females than males (78.5% vs. 21.5%, P < 0.001), HCWs between the ages of 20 and 40 years than those >40 years (70.4% vs. 29.6%, P = 0.005), Saudi HCWs than expatriates (78% vs 22%, P < 0.001), and among HCWs who used social media as a source of information than those who did not (69.8% vs. 38.6%, P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, independent factors associated with uptake were being a Saudi national (aOR = 1.918, 95 %CI = 1.363-2.698, P < 0.001), working in an intensive care unit (aOR = 1.495, 95 %CI = 1.083-2.063, P = 0.014), and working at a university hospital (aOR = 1.867, 95 % CI = 1.380-2.525, P < 0.001). Conclusions: A low level of vaccine uptake was observed especially in female HCWs, those younger than 40 years old, and those who used social media as their source of vaccine information. This survey pro-vides important information for public health authorities in order to scale up vaccination campaigns tar -geting these HCWs to increase vaccine enrollment and uptake.

J	Kohl-Heckl, WK; Schroter, M; Dobos, G; Cramer, H				Kohl-Heckl, Wiebke Kathrin; Schroeter, Marleen; Dobos, Gustav; Cramer, Holger			Complementary medicine use and flu vaccination-A nationally representative survey of US adults	VACCINE			English	Article						Complementary medicine; Influenza; Flu; Vaccination	ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE; CHIROPRACTIC PATIENTS; UNITED-STATES; NO HARM; IMMUNIZATION; PREVENTION; ACCEPTANCE; ATTITUDES; INFLUENZA; CARE	Background: Prior research presented inconsistent results with less, equal or higher vaccination rates among patients using complementary medicine. Given that complementary medicine includes a wide range of therapies, variable vaccination patterns may occur within consultations with different professions. This analysis aims to to evaluate differences between categories of complementary medicine regarding vaccination behavior among US adults. Methods and results: This analysis used data from the 2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; n = 26,742; response rate 80.7%). Prevalences of flu vaccination, consultations with complementary medicine practitioners in the past 12 months and their potential interactions were examined. 42.7% of participants had received flu vaccination in the past 12 months, 32.4% had seen one or more complementary medicine practitioner. Users of any type of complementary medicine were as likely as non-users to have received a flu vaccination (44.8% users versus 41.7% non-users; p = 0,862; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95-1.07). Regarding specific complementary medicine types, individuals consulting with naturopaths (p < 0.001; AOR = 0.67, 95 %CI = 0.54-0.82), homeopaths (p < 0.001; AOR = 0.55; 95 %CI = 0.44-0.69) and chiropractors (p = 0.016; AOR = 0.9, 95 %CI = 0.83-0.98) were less likely, while other complementary medicine approaches showed no significant association with flu vaccination behavior. Independent predictors for a flu shot were prior diabetes, cancer, current asthma, kidney disease, overweight and current pregnancy. As well, higher educational level, age, ethnicity, health insurance coverage and having seen a general physician or medical specialist in the past 12 months were also associated with a higher vaccination rate. Conclusions: Complementary medicine users were equally likely to receive an influenza vaccination compared with non-users. Different complementary therapies showed varied associations with vaccination behavior. Further analyses may be needed to distinguish influencing factors among patients' vaccination behavior.

The aim of this study was to develop oral bacteria biohybrid-based vaccines to treat a mouse model of colorectal cancer. E. coli were combined with tumor antigen-and adjuvant-containing emulsions or liposomes. Emulsion and liposome biohybrid vaccines demonstrated in vitro and in vivo therapeutic potential. Bacteria biohy-brid vaccines significantly increased the expression of CD40(+), CD80(+) and CD86(+) on murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells.

The cPass surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) has gained popularity globally as a dual application assay for: 1. Accurate SARS-CoV-2 population surveillance (seroprevalence) analysis and 2. Revealing the presence of antibodies that block and effectively neutralize the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain and the host cell ACE2 receptor in recovered or vaccinated individuals. This study describes an approach for accurate quantification of neutralizing antibodies using the cPass sVNT with an automated workflow on the Tecan EVO and Dynex Agility platforms that is applicable to other liquid handling systems. This methodology was used to assess the stability of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies between freeze/thaw and refrigerated sample storage conditions. Furthermore, a subset of twenty-five samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected/recovered individuals revealed a 600-fold difference in the neutralizing antibody response where low titers were represented in about half of the samples. Finally, pre- and post-vaccination samples were tested for neutralizing antibodies using the qualitative and semi-quantitative cPass sVNT protocols revealing undetectable or relatively low levels after the first vaccine dose and a decline in levels longitudinally over the months following the second dose. This wide range in neutralizing (blocking) antibodies from both natural infection and vaccination supports a differential immune response that may be attributed to several physiological and genetic factors underlining the potential for measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer levels post-vaccination to help ensure robust and prolonged immunity.

Agreement between state registry, health record, and self-report of influenza vaccination	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza; Influenza vaccination; Vaccine registry; Self-report; Vaccine effectiveness	PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINATION; VACCINES	Background: Documentation of influenza vaccination, including the specific product received, is critical to estimate annual vaccine effectiveness (VE). Methods: We assessed performance of the Michigan Care Improvement Registry (MCIR) in defining influenza vaccination status relative to documentation by provider records or self-report among subjects enrolled in a study of influenza VE from 2011 through 2019. Results: The specificity and positive predictive value of MCIR were high; however, >10% of vaccinations were identified only by other sources each season. The proportion of records captured by MCIR increased from a low of 67% in 2013-2014 to a high of 89% in 2018-2019, largely driven by increased capture of vaccination among adults. Conclusions: State vaccine registries, such as MCIR, are important tools for documenting influenza vaccination, including the specific product received. However, incomplete capture suggests that documentation from other sources and self-report should be used in combination with registries to reduce misclassification. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In Japan, the policy aimed at preventing mother-to-child transmission of HB virus (HBV) initially commenced as a specific vaccination program for infants born to mothers who were positive for HB surface antigen. In 2016, universal HB vaccination was implemented in this country to cover unvaccinated individuals at risk of horizontal HBV transmis-sion. Although HB vaccination has been shown to be highly efficacious and safe, the issues of vaccine non-responders and of the loss of antibodies directed against HB surface antigen (anti-HBs) in HB vaccine recipients remain. To gain better insight into these problems, we previously performed an immunological analysis on adult vaccine recipients after they received an initial HB vaccination. We found that the course of successful HB vaccination is composed of the following distinct phases: 1) acquisition of anti-HBs antibody, 2) attainment of high anti-HBs antibody titers, and 3) maintenance of acquired anti-HBs antibody levels.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the VP1 unique capsid plays a pivotal role in infection. Here, we aimed to improve the immunogenicity of an RBD-based vaccine by genetically fusing it with Streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein A (PspA). Methods: Mice were intramuscularly injected with RBD-based vaccines. Antigen-specific antibodies and neutralizing activity against B19 were measured. Protective immunity against S. pneumoniae was evaluated by monitoring the survival of mice nasally challenged with bacteria and determining antigen specific T cell activation in splenic cells. Results: RBD alone failed to generate neutralizing antibodies against B19, but fusion with PspA induced higher levels of neutralizing IgG compared to B19 virus-like particles. Furthermore, a comparable level of PspA-specific IgG was induced by RBD-PspA and PspA alone, which was sufficient to protect mice against pneumococcal infection. Stimulation with PspA, but not RBD, induced cytokine production in splenic cells from mice immunized with RBD-PspA, suggesting that PspA-specific T cells supported immunoglobulin class switching of both RBD-and PspA-specific B cells. Conclusions: RBD-PspA should be an effective bivalent vaccine against B19 and S. pneumoniae infections. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

They can nonetheless be affected by vaccine hesitancy (VH). Aims: We sought to study the opinions, practices, and perceptions of French hospital staff physicians (HSPs) toward vaccination and the prevalence and correlates of VH among them. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 14 public hospitals in France from September 2018 to October 2019. HSPs completed a standardized questionnaire -most of the time face-to-face - about their vaccine-related attitudes and practices. Data were weighted for age and sex. An agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis of the HSPs' perceptions and opinions toward vaccination allowed us to identify vaccine-hesitant HSPs, and multiple Poisson regression with robust standard errors let us study the factors associated with VH. Results: The study included 1,795 HSPs (participation rate: 86%). Almost all (93.7%) were strongly favorable to vaccination, even though 42.2% (95CI = 39.8-44.6) showed moderate VH. VH prevalence was lowest among infectious disease specialists (12.3%; 95CI = 6.7-21.3) and pediatricians (27.7%; 95CI = 21.4-35.2). Hesitant HSPs were less trustful of vaccination information sources and doubted the safety of vaccines more often than HSPs with almost no VH. Compared with non-hesitant HSPs, those with higher VH had less often taken a medical course about vaccination and were less likely to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza, to recommend vaccines to their patients and to try to convince vaccine-hesitant patients to be vaccinated. Conclusions: Strong favorability to vaccination does not prevent VH, which was observed in most specialties.

To inform considerations for equity when making recommendations, the NACI Secretariat developed a matrix of factors that may influence vaccine equity. To inform the matrix we mapped the evidence for P2ROGRESS And Other factors potentially associated with unequal levels of illness or death from vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) and systematically reviewed the evidence for interventions aimed at reducing inequities. Methods: In October 2019 we searched Medline, Embase, and CINAHL. Two reviewers agreed on the included studies. Our primary outcomes were VPD-related hospitalizations and deaths. Secondary outcomes were differential vaccine access, and exposure, susceptibility, severity, and consequences of VPDs. Two reviewers appraised the certainty of evidence. We mapped the evidence for P2ROGRESS And Other factors and summarized the findings descriptively. We summarized the interventions narratively. Results: We identified 413 studies reporting on P2ROGRESS And Other factors. The most commonly investigated factors included age (n = 374, 89%), pre-existing conditions (n = 179, 42%), and gender identity or sex (n = 144, 34%). We identified 2 trials investigating the effects of interventions. One (n = 1249) provided very low certainty evidence that staff vaccination policies may reduce hospitalizations and deaths from influenza among private care home residents. The other (n not reported) provided very low certainty evidence that universal vaccination by nurses in clinics may reduce hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis compared with vaccination by physicians or no intervention. Conclusions: There is a large body of studies reporting on hospitalizations and deaths from VPDs stratified by P2ROGRESS And Other factors. We found only two trials examining the effects of interventions on hospitalization for or mortality from VPDs. This review has been helpful to NACI and will be helpful to similar organizations aiming to systematically identify and target health inequities through the development of vaccine program recommendations.

In this study, a total of 320 participants were allocated to four age cohorts (6-35 months, 3-8 years, 9-17 years, and >= 18 years; 80 participants/cohort) according to their actual date of birth. Participants in each cohort were randomly assigned to two groups to receive intramuscular injection of the trial vaccine or the comparative vaccine in a one-dose (3-8 years, 9-17 years,and >= 18 years) schedule on day 0 or twodose (6-35 months cohort) schedule on day 0 and 28. The first objective is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the full-dose subunit non-adjuvanted IIV4 (FD-subunit NAIIV4) we developed versus an active-control, China-licensed split-virion NAIIV4, in people >= 3 years. The second objective is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of FD-subunit NAIIV4 versus the half-dose (HD-subunit NAIIV4) in toddlers aged 6-35 months. Results showed that all adverse reactions noted were rare, mild, and selflimited. In >= 3 years cohorts, systemic adverse reactions in FD-subunit NAIIV4 groups were less than the active control split-virion NAIIV4 groups ([Systemic adverse reaction rates (95%CI)], 15.0 (8.6-21.4) versus 19.2(12.1-26.2), p = 0.391). The overall seroprotection efficacy after vaccination were comparable between FD-subunit NAIIV4 and the active control split-virion NAIIV4([Seroprotection rates (95%CI)], H1N1, 99.2(81.3-100.0) versus 94.9(90.9-98.9), p = 0.117; H3N2, 81.7(74.7-88.6) versus 82.1(75.189.0), p = 0.939; BV, 75.8(68.2-83.5) versus 74.4(66.4-82.3), p = 0.793; BY, 94.2(90.0-98.4) versus 92.3 (87.5-97.1), p = 0.568). Additionally, FD-subunit NAIIV4 has comparable safety and better seroprotection versus that of the half-dose in 6-35 months toddlers groups ([Total adverse reaction rates (95%CI)], 37.5 (18.5-56.5) versus 47.5(26.1-68.9), p = 0.366) ([Seroprotection rates (95%CI)], H1N1, 85(56.4-100.0) versus 75.7(47.6-100.0), p = 0.117; H3N2, 50(28.1-71.9) versus 29.7(12.2-47.3), p = 0.070; BV, 75(48.2100.0) versus 29.7(12.2-47.3), p < 0.001; BY, 75(48.2-100.0) versus 56.8(32.5-81.0), p = 0.091). As a result, the FD-subunit NAIIV4 we developed is safe and effective to provide broader and adequate protection against the circulating influenza viruses during 2018-2019, which could be an essential component of the global preventive strategy for influenza pandemic.

Methods: We searched the literature in November 2020 to update a 2014 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review by integrating newly available data. Studies of vaccines that used a comparator and reported the presence or absence of key adverse events were eligible. Adhering to Evidence-based Practice Center methodology, we assessed the strength of evidence (SoE) for all evidence statements. The systematic review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020180089). Results: Of 56,603 reviewed citations, 338 studies reported in 518 publications met inclusion criteria. For children, SoE was high for no increased risk of autism following measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. SoE was high for increased risk of febrile seizures with MMR. There was no evidence of increased risk of intussusception with rotavirus vaccine at the latest follow-up (moderate SoE), nor of diabetes (high SoE). There was no evidence of increased risk or insufficient evidence for key adverse events for newer vaccines such as 9-valent human papillomavirus and meningococcal B vaccines. For adults, there was no evidence of increased risk (varied SoE) or insufficient evidence for key adverse events for the new adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine and recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine. We found no evidence of increased risk (varied SoE) for key adverse events among pregnant women following tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine, including stillbirth (moderate SoE). Conclusions: Across a large body of research we found few associations of vaccines and serious key adverse events; however, rare events are challenging to study. Any adverse events should be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Current therapy options are successful at treating disease, but patients are left without protective immunity and do not benefit the majority asymptomatic patients who do not seek treatment. As such, there is a clear need for a broad acting, protective vaccine that can prevent transmission and protect against symptomatic disease presentation. There are three key elements that underlie successful vaccine development: 1) Chlamydia biology and immune-evasion adaptations, 2) the correlates of protection that prevent disease in natural and experimental infection, 3) reflection upon the evidence provided by previous vaccine attempts. In this review, we give an overview of the unique intracellular biology of C. trachomatis and give insight into the dynamic combination of adaptations that allow Chlamydia to subvert host immunity and survive within the cell. We explore the current understanding of chlamydial immunity in animal models and in humans and characterise the key immune correlates of protection against infection. We discuss in detail the specific immune interactions involved in protection, with relevance placed on the CD4+ T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte responses that are key to pathogen clearance. Finally, we provide a timeline of C. trachomatis vaccine research to date and evaluate the successes and failures in development so far. With insight from these three key elements of research, we suggest potential solutions for chlamydial vaccine development and promising avenues for further exploration. (c) 2021 The Authors.

RSV genomic diversity and the development of a globally effective RSV intervention	VACCINE			English	Article						Respiratory syncytial virus; Genomics; Evolution; Vaccines; Therapeutics; Epidemiology; Transmission; Global health	RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS; GROUP-A; CIRCULATION PATTERNS; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; G-PROTEIN; INFECTION; VARIABILITY; VACCINATION; PREVENTION	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of serious lower respiratory tract illness in infants and children and causes significant disease in the elderly and immunocompromised. Recently there has been an acceleration in the development of candidate RSV vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and therapeutics. However, the effects of RSV genomic variability on the implementation of vaccines and therapeutics remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Fogarty International Center held a workshop to summarize what is known about the global burden and transmission of RSV disease, the phylogeographic dynamics and genomics of the virus, and the networks that exist to improve the understanding of RSV disease. Discussion at the workshop focused on the implications of viral evolution and genomic variability for vaccine and therapeutics development in the context of various immunization strategies. This paper summarizes the meeting, highlights research gaps and future priorities, and outlines what has been achieved since the meeting took place. It concludes with an examination of what the RSV community can learn from our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 genomics and what insights over sixty years of RSV research can offer the rapidly evolving field of COVID-19 vaccines.

The two licensed MenB vaccines require administration of > 2 doses. Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed 2017-2018 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NISTeen) data to evaluate > 1 dose and > 2 dose MenB vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 17 years. Multivariable logistic regression was used to further evaluate determinants of MenB vaccination. Results: Nationally, MenB vaccination coverage among 17-year-olds increased from 14.5% in 2017 to 17.2% in 2018 for > 1 dose and from 6.3% to 8.4% for > 2 doses. MenB vaccination coverage (2017-2018) was the lowest in the South (> 1 dose: 14.6%; > 2 doses: 6.3%) and highest in the Northeast region (18.3% and 9.3%), with variation observed by census division. Adolescents were more likely to have received > 1 dose of MenB vaccine if they had any Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.39) or had received human papillomavirus (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.41-2.67) or meningococcal A, C, W, and Y (OR, 4.03; 95% CI, 2.92-5.56) vaccinations. Conclusions: MenB first-dose coverage in the US is low, and even lower for a second dose, with regional variation. Being up to date with other routinely administered vaccines increased the likelihood of receiving MenB vaccination. (c) 2021 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, a two-dose vaccination strategy is considered. Methods: We developed an age-structured deterministic compartment model using Korean population projection data. The impact of adding a second dose of varicella vaccine on varicella and herpes zoster (HZ) epidemiology was assessed under four different vaccine effectiveness (VE) scenarios (base, moderate, lowest, highest) and the optimal timing of the second vaccine dose (18 months, 4, 5, or 6 years of age) was examined over the period 2020-2065. Results: A two-dose vaccination schedule reduced the cumulative varicella incidence by > 90% compared to no vaccination, regardless of the VE. The additional reduction attributable to a second dose compared to a single dose was greatest (82%) with the lowest VE scenario. A second dose at 6 years of age reduced the varicella incidence at a population level, whereas a second dose at 18 months of age reduced the varicella incidence primarily in the target birth cohorts. Routine vaccination at the age of 18 months with a catch-up vaccination of 6-year-olds was the optimal strategy for birth cohort and population-level control. HZ incidence continued to increase under no vaccination scenario, which represents the effect of aging population. Under a two-dose scenario, the additional increase in HZ incidence attributable to the reduced exogenous boosting was small relative to a one-dose scenario and a further reduction in HZ cases was observed. Conclusion: A two-dose varicella vaccination schedule would significantly reduce varicella and HZ incidence in the long term. A second dose at the age of 18 months with a catch-up vaccination of 6-yearolds would be optimal for controlling varicella in South Korea. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine was recommended in the Mexican Immunisation Programme for pregnant women in 2013. We describe pertussis morbidity and mortality trends in infants <= 2 and <= 12 months of age), before and after maternal Tdap immunisation implementation in Mexico. Methods: An ecological retrospective database study was performed in the Mexican National and Workers Social Security Institutes (IMSS; ISSSTE). Data were collected on confirmed pertussis ambulatory cases, hospitalisations, and deaths, plus vaccination coverage (Tdap; Diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis [DTPa]) and population estimates. Descriptive and regression time-trend analyses were performed for pertussis morbidity and mortality in infants between pre- (2010-2012) and post- (2014-2018) maternal Tdap immunisation periods. Results: Around 1 million infants a year are covered in IMSS/ISSSTE databases. Average full primary infant DTPa vaccine coverage was 71.4%-72.7% nationally. Since 2013, annual maternal Tdap vaccine coverage ranged from 70%-93%. Between 2010-2018, 2,024 pertussis cases, 2,518 hospitalisations and 71 deaths were reported in infants. Among infants 0-2 months old (maternal immunisation target group), there was a significant decrease, post-maternal vaccination, in pertussis incidence (49.9%, p < 0.000), hospitalisation (70.0%, p < 0.000) and mortality (82.4%, p = 0.003). In infants 0-12 months old, pertussis hospitalisations (28.9%, p = 0.000) and mortality (36.2%, p = 0.059) decreased, but incidence increased (61.8%, p = 0.000). Conclusion: After maternal immunisation was implemented, there was a decreasing trend in incidence, hospitalisation and death due to pertussis in infants 0-2 months old. Increases in incidence reported in 0-12-month-olds are likely due to major changes in diagnosis and reporting introduced during the study period as well as limited vaccination and health coverage in some states. These findings confirm the important contribution of the Tdap maternal immunisation programme in reducing pertussis disease burden, particularly severe disease, among infants in Mexico.

Combined use of two separate but protective vaccine antigens provides protection against Taenia ovis infection in lambs in the presence of protective maternal antibody	VACCINE			English	Article						Maternal antibody; Passive transfer; Neonatal vaccination; Sheep; Protection; Taenia ovis	IMMUNIZATION; PREGNANCY	Three recombinant Taenia ovis antigens (To45, To16, To18) each induce protective immunity in lambs or ewes against infection with T. ovis metacestodes. The degree and duration of immunity were assessed in lambs born from vaccinated ewes. Treatment group sizes varied, typically not fewer than 5 animals per group. Ewes were immunised with one T. ovis recombinant protein prior to lambing and the degree and duration of passive immunity in their lambs was assessed by challenge infection up to 18 weeks. Lambs were fully protected up to 6 weeks of age but immunity waned from 6 to 12 weeks and there was no protection when lambs were challenged at 15 weeks. Immunisation of lambs with the homologous recombinant antigen was not effective when vaccinations were given when maternal antibody was high. Lambs were effectively immunised in the presence of passively protective antibody when vaccinated with an antigen that was different to that given to ewes. Vaccination of lambs with a combination of two proteins, To16 and To18, was more effective than giving these single antigens and gave a significant reduction of cyst numbers when lambs were challenged 12 months after immunisation. These results indicate that the use of combinations of T. ovis recombinant antigens could enable complete protection of lambs against infection, if a delivery system becomes available that will maintain antibody at protective levels for 12 months. Alternatively, a third injection given at 6 months may promote the anamnestic response to give long lasting protection. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Harrison, G. B.

Besides its clinical benefit, evidence on the economic value of the nonavalent vaccine is required to inform local vaccination strategies and funding decisions. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of replacing the bivalent vaccine with the nonavalent vaccine in the national school-based HPV vaccination programme in Singapore. Methods: An existing age-structured dynamic transmission model coupled with stochastic individual-based simulations was adapted to project the health and economic impact of vaccinating 13-year-old girls with two doses of the nonavalent or bivalent HPV vaccines in Singapore. Direct costs (in Singapore dollars, S$) were obtained from public healthcare institutions in Singapore, while health state utilities were sourced from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated over a lifetime horizon, from a healthcare system perspective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to obtain the ICERs and corresponding variations across variable uncertainty. Particularly, this study tested the scenarios of lifelong and 20-year vaccine-induced protection, assumed 96.0% and 22.3% cross-protection against HPV-OV by nonavalent and bivalent vaccines respectively, and fixed vaccine prices per dose at S$188 for nonavalent and S$61.50 for bivalent vaccines. Results: Compared with the bivalent vaccine, the use of the nonavalent vaccine was associated with an ICER of S$61,629 per quality-adjusted life year gained in the base case. The result was robust across a range of plausible input values, and to assumptions regarding the duration of vaccine protection. Conclusion: Given the high ICER, the nonavalent vaccine is unlikely to represent a cost-effective option compared with the bivalent vaccine for school-based HPV vaccination of 13-year old female students in Singapore. Substantial price reductions would be required to justify its inclusion in the school-based programme in the future. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We aimed to compare vaccine coverage among children with epilepsy to children without epilepsy. Study design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all 2005-2013 births in Manitoba and Ontario, Canada, creating two cohorts: 2-year-olds and 7-year-olds (followed to age 2 and 7 years). We split each cohort into epilepsy and non-epilepsy subcohorts. We assessed vaccination coverage based on provincial schedules and determined timeliness of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) dose 1 (recommended at 12 months) and DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) dose 4 (recommended at 18 months). We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of the association between epilepsy and vaccination, combining both provincial estimates using random effects meta-analysis. Results: We included 16,558 2-year-olds (Manitoba, 653; Ontario, 15,905) and 13,004 7-year-olds (Manitoba, 483; Ontario, 12,521) with epilepsy. At age 2 years, the aOR for up-to-date vaccination among children with versus without epilepsy was 0.9 (95% confidence interval 0.8-1.1); at age 7 years it was 1.0 (0.9-1.1). Infants diagnosed with epilepsy before age 6 months were less likely to be up-to-date at age 2 years (0.9; 0.8-0.9), although this difference disappeared by age 7 years. Vaccine timeliness was similar between children with and without epilepsy for MMR dose 1 and DTaP dose 4. Conclusions: Overall, this study suggests that children with epilepsy are not significantly under-vaccinated compared to their peers without epilepsy. As children with epilepsy are at a higher risk of complications from vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccination in children with epilepsy should be optimized, especially early in life, as these children may not be able to rely on herd protection.

Hepatitis-A virus has worldwide spread and is endemic in India. Though the disease is self-limiting in most cases, outbreaks are reported frequently from both developing and developed countries of the world. Severity and fatality occur more among infected symptomatic adults. The infection can be prevented with proper and timely immunization. This phase I, single arm, open label, multicenter trial was designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the inactivated hepatitis-A vaccine developed by Human Biologicals Institute when administered in a single dose in two age groups of healthy subjects. Methods: This study was carried out in 55 subjects in two healthy age groups at two centers in India. Group A included subjects of 19-49 years and group B subjects of 12-18 years of age. Enrolled subjects received a single dose of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 46 weeks after vaccination. Safety was assessed by collection and analysis of data on solicited and unsolicited adverse events and immunogenicity was assessed by estimating the seroconversion rate, seroprotection rate and the geometric mean titres of antibodies. Results: Among the 55 subjects enrolled, 15 reported adverse events. No serious adverse event was reported. Pain at the injection site was the lone local adverse event. Systemic adverse events reported in Group A were: fatigue, headache, diarrhoea, fever, anorexia, nausea and upper respiratory tract infection, whereas there was no systemic event reported in Group B. There was 100% seroconversion and seroprotection and significant rise in antibody titre levels were observed in both the groups post vaccination. Conclusions: This study found HBI inactivated hepatitis-A vaccine to be safe and highly immunogenic when administered as a single dose in adolescent and adult subjects. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients and methods: Measles-containing vaccine was offered to unvaccinated children with severe neurologic diseases during a measles outbreak. Vaccination adverse events were reported by parents 30 days following vaccination. Long term effects were evaluated 12 months post vaccination. Results: Twenty-seven children were vaccinated (36 doses given). Half of parents (51.8%) reported no adverse events following immunization. Adverse events included afebrile seizures (6/36), fever alone (5/36) and febrile seizures (5/36). Two children required hospitalization. Quadrivalent measlescontaining vaccine combined with varicella was associated with febrile seizures (p = 0.04). No child needed adjustment of the anti-epileptic treatment or exhibited developmental regression. Conclusion: In a series of children with prior severe neurologic disease, the safety-tolerability profile of vaccines containing a measles vaccine component suggests that vaccination is justified. Main side effect was seizure aggravation in children with known epileptic disease. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Coverage with 3 doses of HepB, introduced in 2002, was 92%-98% during 2004-2007 but declined to 21%-48% during 2010-2016. To obtain data on HBV prevalence among children born after HepB introduction, we tested specimens from a serosurvey conducted in Ukraine in 2017, following circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak in 2015, among birth cohorts eligible for polio immunization response. Methods: The serosurvey was conducted in Zakarpattya, Sumy, and Odessa provinces, and Kyiv City, targeting 2006-2015 birth cohorts. One-stage cluster sampling in the provinces and stratified simple random sampling in Kyiv were used for participant selection. All participants were tested for antibodies against HBV core antigen (anti-HBc). Anti-HBc-positive children were tested for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). We also obtained information on HepB vaccination status for all children. Results: Of 4,596 children tested, 81 (1.8%) were anti-HBc-positive and eight (0.2%) were HBsAg-positive. HBsAg prevalence was 0.7% (95% confidence interval, 0.3%-1.4%) in Zakarpattya, 0.1% (0.0%-0.4%) in Sumy, 0% (0.0%-03%) in Odessa, and 0.1% (0.0%-0.8%) in Kyiv. Across survey sites, the proportion of recipients of >= 3 HepB doses was 53%-80% in the 2006-2009 cohort and 28%-59% in the 2010-2015 cohort. Conclusion: HBV prevalence among children in surveyed regions of Ukraine in 2017 was low, including in Zakarpattya-the only site above the 0.5% European Regional target for HBsAg seroprevalence. However, HepB vaccination was suboptimal, particularly among children born after 2009, resulting in large numbers of unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children at risk of future HBV infection. HepB coverage should be increased to further reduce HBV transmission among children in Ukraine and achieve regional and global hepatitis B control/elimination targets. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Vaccination patterns of the northeast Ohio Amish revisited	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine hesitancy; Anabaptist; Complex medical needs; Religion; COVID-19	CHILDREN; COVERAGE; ACCEPTANCE; DISEASE	Objectives: The Holmes County Amish have low vaccination rates, an increasingly diverse population, and have an increased incidence of certain inherited diseases. The objectives were to evaluate; the rate and influences of vaccine hesitancy compared to a decade ago, vaccination patterns between Amish affiliations, vaccine practices of Amish special needs children, and the Amish's acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. Study design. In April of 2020, a survey assessing vaccination patterns and beliefs were mailed to 1000 Amish families, including ultra-conservative Amish sects and special needs families. Results: The response rate was 39%. Among 391 respondents, 59% did not vaccinate their children, compared to only 14% that refused all vaccinations reported by Wenger et al in the same community only a decade ago. The ultra-conservative Amish rejected vaccines more often. Amish special needs children were more likely to receive vaccines than healthy Amish children. 75% responded they would reject a COVID-19 vaccine. Fear of adverse effects was the most common reason to reject vaccines. Families that accepted vaccines were more likely to cite a healthcare worker as the primary influence to vaccinate. Wives were more likely to cite their spouse as the primary influence to vaccinate. Families that rejected vaccines were more likely to state their bishop was the most influential person on vaccination. Conclusion: The Holmes County Amish have decreasing vaccine acceptance. Efforts to improve vaccination will require a targeted focus on the primary influences and beliefs of sub-populations within the Amish. Physician advocacy, peer mentorship, father-directed education, and close partnership with Church leadership will be needed to limit vaccine-preventable disease. The Amish may be at risk for low uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: A prospective pilot study of humoral immune responses to 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (HD IIV; Fluzone (R) High-Dose; Sanofi Pasteur) was conducted among individuals with MBL and previously untreated CLL. Serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers were measured at baseline and Day 28 after vaccination; seroprotection and seroconversion rates were determined. Memory B cell responses were assessed by B-cell enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assays. Results: Thirty subjects (17 CLL and 13 MBL) were included. Median age was 69.5 years. Day 28 seroprotection rates for the cohort were 19/30 (63.3%) for A/H1N1; 21/23 (91.3%) for A/H3N2; and 13/30 (43.3%) for influenza B. Those with MBL achieved higher day 28 HAI geometric mean titers (54.1 [4.9, 600.1] vs. 12.1 [1.3, 110.1]; p = 0.01) and higher Day 28 seroprotection rates (76.9% vs. 17.6%; p = 0.002) against the influenza B-vaccine strain virus than those with CLL. Conclusions: Immunogenicity of the HD IIV3 in patients with CLL and MBL is lower than reported in healthy adults. Immunogenicity to influenza B was greater in those with MBL than CLL.

Vaccination produces neutralizing antibodies that target the HA1 subunit of the HA (hemagglutinin) protein and are strain specific. The effectiveness of new influenza vaccines are linked to two factors, the correct prediction of the circulating strains in the population in a particular season and the concentration of the HA1 protein in the vaccine formulation. With the advent of the licensing of quadrivalent vaccines, pharmaceutical manufacturers are under considerable pressure due to time constraints and dedicated resources to deliver 194-198 million doses (20202021 U.S. market) of vaccine. Considering the valuable resources needed to produce the influenza vaccine in a timely manner, the efficient quantitation of the HA1 protein (the main component in the influenza vaccine) is required. Currently the only method approved by regulatory agencies for quantitation of the HA antigen in vaccines is the single radial immunodiffusion assay (SRID), an antibody dependent assay that is not time efficient. Time efficient methods that are antibody independent e.g. reverse phasehigh performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) or size exclusion-HPLC (SE-HPLC) are available. An improved method implementing reverse phase-ultra performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) has been developed to quantitate the HA1 protein antigen present in the high yield reassortant vaccine seed viruses from influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes harvested from inoculated embryonated chicken eggs. This method differentiates between high yield and lower yielding reassortants in order to select the best vaccine candidate seed virus with the highest growth 'in ovo'. This direct capability to monitor the HA1 concentration of potential reassortant seed viruses and to choose the best yielding HA influenza reassortant when faced with multiple viral seed candidates provides a major advantage on the industrial scale to the influenza vaccine process.

Vaccination with chimeric protein induces protection in murine model against ascariasis	VACCINE			English	Article						Chimeric antigens; B cell epitopes; Ascaris sp.; IgG response; Antigens	LARVAL MIGRATION; SUUM LARVAE; IMMUNIZATION; ANTIGEN; INFECTION; LUMBRICOIDES; RESISTANCE; PIGS; PREVALENCE; CHILDREN	An estimated 400 million people are infected by parasites of the genus Ascaris and the existing control measures are inefficient. Vaccine development using B cell antigens is a promising strategy for increased protection against this parasite. The present study aimed at developing a chimeric protein capable of conferring protection against infection by Ascaris sp. For this purpose, we performed B-cell epitope predictions on previously described vaccine candidate proteins from Ascaris suum and the corresponding peptides were used to construct a chimeric protein. Female BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously in three doses at 10 day intervals with a vaccine formulation comprised of the chimeric protein together with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA). Control groups included protein alone, MPLA, or PBS. After challenge infection, animals vaccinated with chimeric protein plus MPLA showed a reduction of 73.54% of larval load in the lung compared to control group animals. Animals immunized with chimeric protein plus MPLA also display higher IgG response and a reduction in lung inflammation. Our study highlights how chimeric proteins containing more than one B cell epitope can enhance immune protection against helminthic infection and offer new approaches to the development of Ascaris vaccines.

Even with the implementation of the current live vaccines, rotavirus infections still cause significant mortality and morbidity, indicating a need for new rotavirus vaccines with improved efficacy. To this end, we have developed an S-R69A-VP8*/S-60-VP8* nanoparticle rotavirus vaccine candidate that will be delivered parenterally with Alum adjuvant. In this study, as parts of our further development of this nanoparticle vaccine, we evaluated 1) roles of rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) that is the rotavirus enterotoxin, a possible vaccine target, and an immune stimulator, and 2) effects of CpG adjuvant that is a toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand and agonist on the immune response and protection of our S-R69A-VP8*/S-60-VP8* nanoparticle vaccine. The resulted vaccine candidates were examined for their IgG responses in mice. In addition, the resulted mouse sera were assessed for i) blocking titers against interactions of rotavirus VP8* proteins with their glycan ligands, ii) neutralization titers against rotavirus replication in cell culture, and iii) passive protection against rotavirus challenge with diarrhea in suckling mice. Our data showed that the Alum adjuvant appeared to work better with the S-R69A-VP8*/S-60-VP8* nanoparticles than the CpG adjuvant, while an addition of the NSP4 antigen to the S-R69A-VP8*/S-60-VP8* vaccine may not help to further increase the immune response and protection of the resulted vaccine.

Trends in COVID-19 vaccination intent and factors associated with deliberation and reluctance among adult homeless shelter residents and staff, 1 November 2020 to 28 February 2021-King County, Washington	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Shelter; Homeless; Vaccination; Health inequities	UNITED-STATES; POPULATIONS	Introduction: Little is known about COVID-19 vaccination intent among people experiencing homelessness. This study assesses surveyed COVID-19 vaccination intent among adult homeless shelter residents and staff and identifies factors associated with vaccine deliberation (responded "undecided") and reluctance (responded "no"), including time trends. Methods: From 11/1/2020-2/28/21, we conducted repeated cross-sectional surveys at nine shelters in King County, WA as part of ongoing community-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. We used a multinomial model to identify characteristics associated with vaccine deliberation and reluctance. Results: A total of 969 unique staff (n = 297) and residents (n = 672) participated and provided 3966 survey responses. Among residents, 53.7% (n = 361) were vaccine accepting, 28.1% reluctant, 17.6% deliberative, and 0.6% already vaccinated, whereas among staff 56.2% were vaccine accepting, 14.1% were reluctant, 16.5% were deliberative, and 13.1% already vaccinated at their last survey. We observed higher odds of vaccine deliberation or reluctance among Black/African American individuals, those who did not receive a seasonal influenza vaccine, and those with lower educational attainment. There was no significant trend towards vaccine acceptance. Conclusions: Strong disparities in vaccine intent based on race, education, and prior vaccine history were observed. Increased vaccine intent over the study period was not detected. An intersectional, personcentered approach to addressing health inequities by public health authorities planning vaccination campaigns in shelters is recommended.

Canadian parents' perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination and intention to vaccinate their children: Results from a cross-sectional national survey	VACCINE			English	Article						2021; COVID-19; Pandemic; Vaccination; Immunization; Parent; Intention; Perceptions	ACCEPTABILITY; WILLINGNESS	Background: Vaccinating children (<17 years old) is important for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. As parents are primary decision makers for their children, we aimed to assess parents' perceptions and intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination for their children, including for some underserved populations (e.g., newcomers, Indigenous peoples, and visible minority groups). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional national survey of Canadian parents in December 2020, just as COVID-19 vaccines were approved for adults, to assess intention to vaccinate their children (aged 0-17 years) against COVID-19, perceptions of COVID-19 disease and vaccines, previous uptake of influenza and routine vaccines, and sociodemographic characteristics. Binomial logistic regression was used to assess the association between parents' lack of COVID-19 vaccination intention for their children and various independent variables. Results: Sixty-three percent of parents (1074/1702) intended to vaccinate their children against COVID19. Those employed part-time (compared to full-time) had lower intention to vaccinate their children (aOR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.06-2.84), while those who spoke languages other than English, French, or Indigenous languages were less likely to have low intention (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.32-0.92). Low vaccination intention was also associated with children not receiving influenza vaccine pre-pandemic (aOR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.04-2.21), parents having low intention to vaccinate themselves against COVID19 (aOR = 9.22, 95% CI: 6.43-13.34), believing COVID-19 vaccination is unnecessary (aOR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.72-3.91) or unsafe (aOR = 4.21, 95% CI: 2.96-5.99), and opposing COVID-19 vaccine use in children without prior testing (aOR = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.87-5.24). Interpretation: Parents' COVID-19 vaccination intentions for their children are better predicted by previous decisions regarding influenza vaccination than routine childhood vaccines, and other perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine-related factors. Public communication should highlight the safety and necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in children to support a return to normal activities. Further research should assess actual COVID-19 vaccination uptake in children, particularly for underserved populations. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Patrick			Using the Theory of Planned behavior to identify correlates of HPV vaccination uptake among college students attending a rural university in Alabama	VACCINE			English	Article						HPV vaccine; College students; Theory of Planned Behavior; Vaccine acceptance; Vaccine hesitancy	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINE; AGED 13-17 YEARS; UNITED-STATES; KNOWLEDGE; ATTITUDES; SPIRITUALITY; INTENTIONS; AWARENESS; COVERAGE; BELIEFS	Introduction: Humanpapillomavirus (HPV) has infected nearly 80 million people in the U.S., and is associated with most cervical cancer cases. Alabama ranks first in the country for cervical cancer mortality and third for incidence. Although the HPV vaccine can prevent HPV and reduce cancer rates, Alabama is well-below the national average for HPV vaccination. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this Alabama-based study aimed to examine college students' intentions to get the HPV vaccine; to examine the relationship between the relationship between religious beliefs and HPV vaccination uptake status among college students. Methods: Students (n = 257) from a university in rural Alabama completed the survey. Multiple regression analysis, Mann-Whitney U tests, and moderation analysis were used to examine associations among the variables of interest. Findings: Consistent with TPB, results showed that attitudes and subjective norms were significant predictors of intention to get vaccinated. Knowledge that both sexes can experience HPV-related health problems, that HPV can cause genital warts, and that the vaccine protects against HPV were each associated with higher attitude scores. The results indicated that the odds of getting at least one HPV shot were higher for females than for males for non-Caucasians than for Caucasians. Students who were not vaccinated were more likely to report that religion influenced their health beliefs. *Abstract. Conclusion: TPB was helpful in understanding HPV-related intentions. Communication and education efforts are needed to increase understanding of HPV illnesses and HPV vaccination benefits among peers, parents, and other loved ones of students. in the rural areas of Alabama.

This study examined social determinants of parental COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake for children and adolescents. Methods: We used cross-sectional data from an ongoing COVID-19 cohort study in Montreal, Canada and included all parents of 2 to 18-year-olds who completed an online questionnaire between May 18 and June 26, 2021 (n = 809). We calculated child age-adjusted prevalence estimates of vaccine acceptance by parental education, race/ethnicity, birthplace, household income, and neighbourhood, and used multinomial logistic regression to estimate adjusted prevalence differences (aPD) and ratios (aPR). Social determinants of vaccine uptake were examined for the vaccine-eligible sample of 12 to 18 year-olds (n = 306). Results: Intention to vaccinate children against COVID-19 was high, with only 12.4% of parents unlikely to have their child vaccinated. Parents with younger children were less likely to accept vaccination, as were those from lower-income households, racialized groups, and those born outside Canada. Children from households with annual incomes <$100,000 had 18.4 percent lower prevalence of being vaccinated/very likely vaccinated compared to household incomes >$150,000 (95% CI: 10.1 to 26.7). Racialized parents reported greater unwillingness to vaccinate vs. White parents (aPD = 10.3; 95% CI: 1.5, 19.1). Vaccine-eligible adolescents from the most deprived neighbourhood were half as likely to be vaccinated compared to those from the least deprived neighbourhood (aPR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.77). Interpretation. This study identified marked social inequalities in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake for children and adolescents. Efforts are needed to reach disadvantaged and marginalized populations with tailored strategies that promote informed decision making and facilitate access to vaccination. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Bringing rVSV-S to clinical trials required the development of a scalable downstream process for the production of rVSV-S that can meet regulatory guidelines. The objective of this study was the development of the first downstream unit operations for cell-culture-derived rVSV-S, namely, the removal of nucleic acid contamination, the clarification and concentration of viral harvested supernatant, and buffer exchange. Retaining the infectivity of the rVSV-S during the downstream process was challenged by the shear sensitivity of the enveloped rVSV-S and its membrane protruding spike protein. Through a series of screening experiments, we evaluated and established the required endonuclease treatment conditions, filter train composition, and hollow fiber-tangential flow filtration parameters to remove large particles, reduce the load of impurities, and concentrate and exchange the buffer while retaining rVSV-S infectivity. The combined effect of the first unit operations on viral recovery and the removal of critical impurities was examined during scale-up experiments. Overall, approximately 40% of viral recovery was obtained and the regulatory requirements of less than 10 ng host cell DNA per dose were met. However, while 86-97% of the host cell proteins were removed, the regulatory acceptable HCP levels were not achieved, requiring subsequent purification and polishing steps. The results we obtained during the scale-up experiments were similar to those obtained during the screening experiments, indicating the scalability of the process. The findings of this study set the foundation for the development of a complete downstream manufacturing process, requiring subsequent purification and polishing unit operations for clinical preparations of rVSV-S.

Borno state, located in the North-Eastern parts of the country, started experiencing insurgency since 2009 by a militant group commonly referred to as "Boko Haram", leading to displacement of numerous persons from their homes. The state government created internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps with an estimated 600,000 persons and over 100,000 children aged 9 - 59 months. We explored the challenges in implementing the measles campaign in 2017 and its effect on measles elimination and control efforts in Borno State. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of the measles surveillance data from the Integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR), the early warning alert and response system (EWARS), Measles SIA implementation strategy reports and the Post campaign evaluation survey data. Result: Seven (26%) of the 27 LGAs had security challenges in Borno state in November 2017. Following the measles campaign, 30 EAs were surveyed as part of the post campaign evaluation with a coverage validation of 72%, the lowest reported state level coverage in the country. Reported measles cases in the age cohort <1Year increased in 2018 by 14.3% compared to 2017. Conclusion: Despite the security challenges in Borno state, the 2017 measles SIA was conducted with the post campaign evaluation highlighting some areas of suboptimal performance. There remains a need to review the required strategies for successful implementation in Borno and other states affected by security challenges.

Vaccination information, motivations, and barriers in the context of meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine introduction: A qualitative assessment among caregivers in Burkina Faso, 2018	VACCINE			English	Article						Burkina Faso; Meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine; Measles vaccine; Immunization schedule; Vaccine introduction; Vaccination challenges	AFRICAN MENINGITIS BELT; IMPACT; SURVEILLANCE; COUNTRIES	Background: In March 2017, Burkina Faso introduced meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine (MACV) into the Expanded Programme on Immunization. MACV is administered to children aged 15-18 months, concomitantly with the second dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2). One year after MACV introduction, we assessed the sources and content of immunization information available to caregivers and explored motivations and barriers that influence their decision to seek MACV for their children. Methods: Twenty-four focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with caregivers of children eligible for MACV and MCV2. Data collection occurred in February-March 2018 in four purposively selected districts, each from a separate geographic region; within each district, caregivers were stratified into groups based on whether their children were unvaccinated or vaccinated with MACV. FGDs were recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: We identified many different sources and content of information about MACV and MCV2 available to caregivers. Healthcare workers were most commonly cited as the main sources of information; caregivers also received information from other caregivers in the community. Caregivers' motivations to seek MACV for their children were driven by personal awareness, engagements with trusted messengers, and perceived protective benefits of MACV against meningitis. Barriers to MACV and MCV2 uptake were linked to the unavailability of vaccines, immunization personnel not providing doses, knowledge gaps about the 15-18 month visit, practical constraints, past negative experiences, sociocultural influences, and misinformation, including misunderstanding about the need for MCV2. Conclusions: MACV and MCV2 uptake may be enhanced by addressing vaccination barriers and effectively communicating vaccination information and benefits through trusted messengers such as healthcare workers and other caregivers in the community. Educating healthcare workers to avoid withholding vaccines, likely due to fear of wastage, may help reduce missed opportunities for vaccination. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Projahnmo Study Grp Bangladesh	Impact of national introduction of ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on invasive pneumococcal disease in Bangladesh: Case-control and time-trend studies	VACCINE			English	Article						Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; Invasive pneumococcal disease; Case-control study; Time-trend study; Bangladesh	STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE; RURAL BANGLADESH; CHILDREN; BURDEN; MORTALITY; EFFICACY	Background: Bangladesh introduced the ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) into its national immunization program in March 2015 creating an opportunity to assess the real-world impact of PCV on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Methods: Between January 2014 and June 2018, children aged 3-35 months in three rural sub-districts of Sylhet district of Bangladesh were visited every two months to collect morbidity and care-seeking data. Children attending sub-district hospitals with pneumonia, meningitis, or sepsis were assessed for IPD after obtaining informed consent. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid were collected from enrolled children to isolate pneumococcus using culture and molecular test. Children who were age-eligible to receive the PCV and had pneumococcus isolated were enrolled as cases. Four age and sex-matched clinic and community controls were selected for each case within one to two weeks of case identification. Data on immunization status and confounders were collected. PCV coverage was estimated using vaccine coverage surveys. Case-control and incidence trend analyses were conducted to assess the impact of PCV on IPD. Results: The community cohort yielded 217,605 child years of observations and 154,773 sick child-visits to study hospitals. Pneumococcus was isolated from 44 children who were age-eligible to receive PCV; these children were enrolled as cases. The cases were matched with 166 community-and 150 clinic controls. The matched case-control analyses using community-controls showed 83% effectiveness (95% CI: 1.57-97.1%) and clinic controls showed 90% effectiveness (95% CI:-26.0% to 99.1%) of PCV in preventing IPD. Incidence trend analysis estimated vaccine effectiveness at 80.1% (95% CI: 38.4, 93.6). Conclusion: PCV in this pediatric population in Bangladesh was highly effective in preventing IPD.

Vaccines are currently being developed for NiV, and studies have been funded to evaluate their safety and immunogenicity. An important unanswered question is whether it will be possible to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine candidates in phase III clinical trials in a context where spillovers from the zoono-tic reservoir are infrequent and associated with small outbreaks. The objective of this study was to inves-tigate the feasibility of conducting a phase III vaccine trial in Bangladesh, the only country regularly reporting NiV cases. Methods: We used simulations based on previously observed NiV cases from Bangladesh, an assumed vaccine efficacy of 90% and other NiV vaccine target characteristics, to compare three vaccination study designs: (i) cluster randomized ring vaccination, (ii) cluster randomized mass vaccination, and (iii) an observational case-control study design. Results: The simulations showed that, assuming a ramp-up period of 10 days and a mean hospitalization delay of 4 days,a cluster-randomized ring vaccination trial would require 516 years and over 163,000 vac-cine doses to run a ring vaccination trial under current epidemic conditions. A cluster-randomized mass vaccination trial in the two most affected districts would take 43 years and 1.83 million vaccine doses. An observational case-control design in these two districts would require seven years and 2.5 million vaccine doses. Discussion: Without a change in the epidemiology of NiV, ring vaccination or mass vaccination trials are unlikely to be completed within a reasonable time window. In this light, the remaining options are: (i) not conducting a phase III trial until the epidemiology of NiV changes, (ii) identifying alternative ways to licensure such as observational studies or controlled studies in animals such as in the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Animal Rule.

Directly addressing dendritic cells or Langerhans cells in vivo represents an attractive strategy for inducing T cell responses in cancer immunotherapy. We and others have studied fractional laser ablation as a novel method combining efficient delivery of macromolecules to the skin with an inherent adjuvant effect of laser illumination. In this proof of concept study, we demonstrate the feasibility of peptide delivery to the skin using the P.L.E.A.S.E. professional Erb:YAG fractional infrared laser together with EPIMMUN patches. In an ovalbumin mouse model we demonstrate that a dry patch formulation of SIINFEKL peptide in combination with CpG-ODN1826, but not imiquimod or polyI:C, induces potent cytotoxic T cell responses, which can be further boosted by co-delivery of the pan-helper T cell epitope PADRE.

Safety and immunogenicity of two formulations of rotavirus vaccine in Vietnamese infants	VACCINE			English	Article						Rotavirus; Immunogenicity; Safety; Vietnam; Diarrhoea; Infants	LIVE	Background and aims: ROTAVIN-M1 (R) (licensed, frozen vaccine) and ROTAVIN (second-generation, liquid candidate vaccine) are two rotavirus vaccine formulations developed from a live attenuated G1P8 (KH0118) strain by Center for Research and Production of Vaccines and Biologicals (POLYVAC), Vietnam. This study compared the safety and immunogenicity of these two formulations. Methods: A Phase 3, randomized, partially double-blinded, active-controlled study was conducted in healthy infants aged 60-91 days in Vietnam. Infants received two doses of ROTAVIN or ROTAVIN-M1 in a ratio of 2:1 with an interval of 8 weeks. Solicited reactions were collected for 7 days after each vaccination. Blood samples were collected pre-vaccination and 4 weeks after the second vaccination in a subset of infants. Non-inferiority criteria required that the lower bound of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the post-vaccination anti-rotavirus IgA GMC (Geometric Mean Concentration) ratio of ROTAVIN/ROTAVIN-M1 should be >0.5. A co-primary objective was to compare the safety of the two vaccines in terms of solicited reactions. Results: A total of 825 infants were enrolled. The post-vaccination GMC was 48.25 (95% CI: 40.59, 57.37) in the ROTAVIN group and 35.04 (95% CI: 27.34, 44.91) in the ROTAVIN-M1 group with an IgA GMC ratio of 1.38 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.86) thus meeting the pre-set criteria for non-inferiority. A total of 605 solicited reactions were reported in 297 (36.0%) participants with 35.4% in the ROTAVIN group and 37.2% in the ROTAVIN-M1 group. There were no cases of intussusception or death reported in the study. Conclusions: Based on the data generated, it can be concluded that ROTAVIN is immunologically non-inferior and has similar safety profile to ROTAVIN-M1 when administered to infants in a two-dose schedule. Therefore, it can be considered as a more suitable option for programmatic use to prevent rotavirus diarrhoea in Vietnam and the Mekong region. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Our findings demonstrated that increased levels of CXCL8, CCL2, CXCL10, IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a were observed in YEL-AEFI ("A1" and "C" classes) as compared to primary vaccines without YEL-AEFI [PV(day 3-28)] and reference range (RR) controls. Notably, increased levels of CCL3, CCL4, CCL2, CCL5, IL-1b, IL-15, IL-1Ra and G-CSF were found in "A1" as compared to "C" class. Venn diagrams analysis allowed the pre-selection of biomarkers for further analysis of performance indices. Data demonstrated that CCL3, CCL5, IL-15 and IL-1Ra presented high global accuracy (AUC = 1.00) to discriminate "A1" from "C". Decision tree was proposed with a reliable algorithm to discriminate YEL-AEFI cases according to cause-specific definitions with outstanding overall accuracy (91%). CCL3, CCL5, IL-15 and IL-1Ra appears as root attributes to identify "A1" followed by VEGF as branch nodes to discriminate Wild Type YFV infection ("C(WT-YFV)") from cases with other illnesses ("C*"). Together, these results demonstrated the applicability of serum biomarker measurements as putative parameters towards the establishment of accurate laboratorial tools for complementary differential diagnosis of YEL-AEFI cases.

In addition to acute illness, there is an increasing appreciation of the long-term consequences of enteric infections, including ETEC, on childhood growth and development. Provision of potable water and sanitation and appropriate clinical care for acute illness are critical to reduce the ETEC burden. However, these interventions are not always practical and may not achieve equitable and sustainable coverage. Vaccination may be the most cost-effective and equitable means of primary prevention; however, additional data are needed to accelerate the investment and guide the decision-making process for ETEC vaccines. First, to understand and quantify the ETEC disease burden, additional data are needed on the association between ETEC infection and physical and cognitive stunting as well as delayed educational attainment. Furthermore, the role of inappropriate or inadequate antibiotic treatment of ETEC-attributable diarrhoea may contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and needs further elucidation. An ETEC vaccine that mitigates acute diarrhoeal illness and minimizes the longer-term disease manifestations could have significant public health impact and be a cost-effective countermeasure. Herein we review the ETEC vaccine pipeline, led by candidates compatible with the general parameters of the Preferred Product Characteristics (PPC) recently developed by the World Health Organization. Additionally, we have developed an ETEC Vaccine Development Strategy to provide a framework to underpin priority activities for researchers, funders and vaccine manufacturers, with the goal of addressing globally unmet data needs in the areas of research, product development, and policy, as well as commercialization and delivery. The strategy also aims to guide prioritization and co-ordination of the priority activities needed to minimize the timeline to licensure and use of ETEC vaccines, especially in in low-and middle-income countries, where they are most urgently needed.

Methods: A total of 680 recruits were selected for observation of their tetanus antibody levels. From 2005 to 2015, 691 peacekeepers with tetanus vaccination were included in the questionnaire-based and serological survey based on cluster stratification. The tetanus antibody-positive rate, geometric mean concentration (GMC), and their respective changes over time were analyzed in different age groups, regions, and years after tetanus booster immunization. Results: The positivity rates of tetanus antibodies in the recruits and peacekeepers were 74.85% and 99.86%, respectively (chi(2) = 193.00, P < 0.05) and the antibody GMCs were 0.05 and 0.70 IU/mL (t = 15.73, P < 0.05). The antibody positivity rates of recruits from 12 provinces ranged from 47.62% (Hubei) to 100% (Inner Mongolia) (chi(2) = 37.24, P < 0.05) and the antibody GMCs ranged from 0.02 (Hubei) to 0.09 IU/mL (Heilongjiang) (F = 5.19, P < 0.01). Among the 691 peacekeepers, no statistically significant difference in antibody positivity rate was detected between men and women. After administration of one booster dose of the tetanus vaccine, a protective antibody level was calculated to persist up to 22 years; a significant difference in antibody levels was observed within 10 years between one and two or more booster doses. Conclusion: The rate at which recruits tested positive for tetanus antibodies was low. Thus, it is necessary to screen for tetanus antibodies during military recruitment and implement a precision-based booster immunization protocol for tetanus vaccine. Moreover, one dose of the tetanus vaccine booster has been calculated to maintain a protective antibody level up to 22 years, without the need for repeated reinforcements during this period.

Estimating the number of averted illnesses and deaths as a result of vaccination against an influenza pandemic in nine low- and middle-income countries	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza; Influenza vaccine; Mathematical modeling; Pandemic	PRODUCTION CAPACITY; H1N1 VIRUS; VACCINES; OUTBREAK; PROGRAM; ASTHMA; PREPAREDNESS; STRATEGIES; INFECTION; CHILDREN	Background: During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, 77 countries received donated monovalent A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine through the WHO Pandemic Influenza A(H1N1) Vaccine Deployment Initiative. However, 47% did not receive their first shipment until after the first wave of virus circulation, and 8% did not receive their first shipment until after the WHO declared the end of the pandemic. Arguably, these shipments were too late into the pandemic to have a substantial effect on virus transmission or disease burden during the first waves of the pandemic. Objectives: In order to evaluate the potential benefits of earlier vaccine availability, we estimated the number of illnesses and deaths that could be averted during a 2009-like influenza pandemic under five different vaccine-availability timing scenarios. Methods: We adapted a model originally developed to estimate annual influenza morbidity and mortality burden averted through US seasonal vaccination and ran it for five vaccine availability timing scenarios in nine low-and middle-income countries that received donated vaccine. Results: Among nine study countries, we estimated that the number of averted cases was 61-216,197 for actual vaccine receipt, increasing to 2,914-283,916 had vaccine been available simultaneously with the United States. Conclusions: Earlier delivery of vaccines can reduce influenza case counts during a simulated 2009-like pandemic in some low-and middle-income countries. For others, increasing the number of cases and deaths prevented through vaccination may be dependent on factors other than timely initiation of vaccine administration, such as distribution and administration capacity.

We conducted serological surveillance to explore vaccination coverage levels. We also conducted a case-control study to investigate a hypothesised cross-protective effect of the HPV16/18 vaccine against genital warts. Methods: Residual serum specimens from 16 to 20 year-old women attending six specialist sexual health services (SSHS) between 2011 and 2015 in England were tested for antibodies against HPV16 and HPV18 using a virus-like particle (VLP)-based multiplex serology assay. Patients were classified as having vaccine-induced seropositivity if they were seropositive for both HPV types and either had high antibody levels for at least one HPV type, or moderately high levels for both HPV types. Differences in vaccine-induced seropositivity by patient characteristics were investigated using logistic regression. Vaccine-induced seropositivity was then compared for patients with genital warts (cases) and matched patients without (controls). Results: Of 3,973 serum specimens collected, 3,870 (97.4%) had a valid result. The proportion of women with vaccine-induced seropositivity decreased with age (from 78.1% in 16-year-olds to 52.6% in 20-year olds). Vaccine-induced seropositivity was lower among women born outside the UK, from more deprived areas and with a history of chlamydia diagnosis. A difference in uptake by ethnic group was also seen but this was largely confounded by differences in deprivation and country of birth. Among 537 cases and 1,515 controls, there was little evidence of a protective effect of the bivalent HPV vaccine against genital warts (adjusted odds ratio 0.93; 95% CI: 0.74-1.18). Discussion: Vaccine-induced seropositivity in this high-risk population was in line with vaccination coverage in the general population although was lower in some at-risk sub-groups. This study does not provide evidence to support a cross-protective effect of the HPV16/18 vaccine against genital warts. Crown Copyright (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There are three antigen expression strategies for LAB: cytoplasmic expression (CE), cell surface display (SD), and extracellular secretion (ES). Despite the generally higher protein expression level and many observations of antigen-specific immunogenicity in CE, its application as a mucosal vaccine has been overlooked relative to SD and ES because of the antigens enclosed by the LAB cell wall. We hypothesized that the antigens in CE could be released from the LAB into the intestinal lumen before host bacterial access to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which could contribute to antigen-specific immune responses after oral administration. To elucidate this hypothesis, three recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) strains were constructed to produce a model antigen, BmpB, with or without an M cell-targeting moiety, and their immunogenicities were analyzed comparatively as oral vaccines in mouse model. The data indicated that the recombinant LPs producing BmpBs with different conformations could induce mucosal immunity differentially. This suggests that the cytoplasmic antigens in LAB could be released into the intestinal lumen, subsequently translocated through M cells, and stimulate the GALT to generate antigen-specific immune responses. Therefore, the CE strategy has great potential, especially in the application of oral LAB vaccines as well as SD and ES strategies. This research provides a better understanding of the mechanism for recombinant oral LAB vaccines and gives insight to the future design of LAB vaccines and oral delivery applications for useful therapeutic proteins.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) to reduce burden of two currently circulating influenza B lineages. Until 2019 Korean National Immunization Program (NIP) recommended trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) after ongoing debates on cost effectiveness of QIV for elderly population. Although influenza vaccine only showed modest effect on reducing influenza in elderly, this study aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of inactivated QIV in healthy participants > 65 years of age. Methods: A total of 274 healthy participants aged > 65 years received a QIV. Seroconversion-based vaccine efficacy of 4 strains of seasonal influenza was assessed 21 days after vaccination and adverse events were monitored until 180 days after vaccination. Results: The percentages of participants seroconverted after vaccination on HI antibody against each strain were 36.5% (99/271) to A/H1N1, 47.6% (129/271) to A/H3N2, 40.6% (110/271) to B Yamagata, and 49.1% (133/271) to B Victoria. The percentages of participants seroprotected after vaccination on HI antibody against each strain were 81.2% (220/271) to A/H1N1, 98.5% (267/271) to A/H3N2, 95.2% (258/271) to B Yamagata, and 93.7% (254/271) to B Victoria. There was no serious adverse event (SAE) related with the study vaccine. Conclusion: The quadrivalent split influenza vaccine is expected to offer seroprotection against influenza A and both influenza B lineages even in the elderly population. (c) 2021 The Authors.

The recombinant, live, attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) is recommended for dengue seropositive individuals > 9 years. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is recommended for girls aged 9-14 years to prevent HPV infection-related cancers. This study assessed the immunogenicity and safety of a bivalent HPV (types 16 and 18) vaccine and CYD-TDV when co-administered concomitantly or sequentially. This was a Phase IIIb, randomized, open-label, multicenter study in girls aged 9-14 years in Mexico (NCT02979535). Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive three doses of CYD-TDV 6 months apart and two doses of bivalent HPV vaccine either concomitantly with, or 1 month before (sequentially), the first 2 CYD-TDV doses. Antibody levels were measured at baseline and 28-days after each vaccine dose for all participants, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies, and a plaque reduction neutralization test for the four dengue serotypes; results are reported only for participants who were seropositive at baseline. Safety was assessed for all randomized participants throughout the study. Of the randomized participants, 305/478 (63.8%) were seropositive for dengue at baseline: 154 in the concomitant group and 151 in the sequential group. After the last HPV vaccine dose, the antibody titers for HPV were comparable in seropositive participants between treatment groups, with between group titer ratios of 0.966 for HPV-16 and 0.999 for HPV-18. After dose 3 of CYD-TDV, antibody titers were comparable for the concomitant and sequential groups across all serotypes, with between-group ratios close to 1 (serotype 1: 0.977; serotype 2: 0.911; serotype 3: 0.921; serotype 4: 0.931). CYD-TDV and a bivalent HPV vaccine administered concomitantly or sequentially in dengue seropositive girls aged 9-14 years elicited comparable immune responses with similar safety profiles.

A replication-incompetent adenoviral vector based on human adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) has been evaluated in several clinical trials. The Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V3SWG) was formed to evaluate the safety and features of recombinant viral vector vaccines. This paper reviews features of the Ad26 vectors, including tabulation of safety and risk assessment characteristics of Ad26-based vaccines. In the Ad26 vector, deletion of E1 gene rendering the vector replication incompetent is combined with additional genetic engineering for vaccine manufacturability and transgene expression optimization. These vaccines can be manufactured in mammalian cell lines at scale providing an effective, flexible system for high-yield manufacturing. Ad26 vector vaccines have favorable thermostability profiles, compatible with vaccine supply chains. Safety data are compiled in the Ad26 vaccine safety database version 4.0, with unblinded data from 23 ongoing and completed clinical studies for 3912 participants in five different Ad26-based vaccine programs. Overall, Ad26-based vaccines have been well tolerated, with no significant safety issues identified. Evaluation of Ad26-based vaccines is continuing, with >114,000 participants vaccinated as of 4th September 2020. Extensive evaluation of immunogenicity in humans shows strong, durable humoral and cellular immune responses. Clinical trials have not revealed impact of pre-existing immunity to Ad26 on vaccine immunogenicity, even in the presence of Ad26 neutralizing antibody titers or Ad26-targeting T cell responses at baseline. The first Ad26-based vaccine, against Ebola virus, received marketing authorization from EC on 1st July 2020, as part of the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen. New developments based on Ad26 vectors are underway, including a COVID-19 vaccine, which is currently in phase 3 of clinical evaluation. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

EEEV is the causative agent of a devastating meningoencephalitis syndrome, with approximately 30% mortality and significant morbidity. There is no licensed human vaccine against EEEV. An inactivated EEEV vaccine has been offered under investigational new drug (IND) protocols at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) since 1976. Methods: Healthy at-risk laboratory personnel received inactivated PE-6 strain EEEV (TSI-GSD 104) vaccine under two separate IND protocols. Protocol FY 99?11 (2002?2008) had a primary series consisting of doses on day 0, 7, and 28. Protocol FY 06?31 (2008?2016) utilized a primary series with doses on day 0 and 28, and month 6. Participants with an inadequate immune response, plaque reduction neutralization test with 80% cut-off (PRNT80) titer 40, received booster vaccination. Volunteers with prior EEEV vaccination were eligible to enroll for booster doses based on annual titer evaluation. Results: The FY06-31 dosing schema resulted in significantly greater post-primary series immune response (PRNT80 40) rates (84% vs 54%) and geometric mean titers (184.1 vs 39.4). The FY 06?31 dosing schema also resulted in significantly greater cumulative annual immune response rates from 1 to up to 7 years post vaccination (75% vs 59%) and geometric mean of titers (60.1 vs 43.0). The majority of probably or definitely related adverse events were mild and local; there were no probably or definitely related serious adverse events. Conclusions: Inactivated PE-6 EEEV vaccine is safe and immunogenic in at-risk laboratory personnel. A prolonged primary series, with month 6 dose, significantly improved vaccine immunogenicity both post-primary series and longitudinally on annual titers. Despite decades of safe use under IND, full licensure is not planned due to manufacturing constraints, and ongoing development of alternatives. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hamilton, RA; Krockow, EM; Vekria, P				Hamilton, Ryan A.; Krockow, Eva M.; Vekria, Priya			Attitudes towards influenza and uptake of the flu vaccine: A survey of pharmacy staff working in English hospitals	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza; Vaccine; Pharmacy Staff; Pharmacist; Pharmacy Technician; Secondary care	HEALTH-CARE WORKERS; PROFESSIONALS; RATES; KNOWLEDGE; BARRIERS; COVERAGE	Objectives: Pharmacy staff working in hospitals are at risk of contracting and disseminating influenza. Previous research focuses on community pharmacists' attitudes towards influenza and vaccination. This survey investigates the beliefs and attitudes of pharmacists and other pharmacy staff working in English Hospitals regarding influenza and the vaccine and how this relates to vaccine uptake. Methods: A self-administered survey was provided to pharmacy staff at three hospitals in the East Midlands of England. Job role, age and vaccination status (vaccinated, intended to be vaccinated, and not vaccinated) were collected alongside ratings of agreement with 20 statements regarding influenza and vaccination using a Likert scale. Results: 170 pharmacy staff responded; 50.6% had been vaccinated, 17.1% intended to be vaccinated and 32.4% were not vaccinated. Increasing age showed a significant (p = 0.017) positive correlation with increased vaccine uptake as did the beliefs that vaccination protects the individual from influenza (p = 0.049) and that vaccination should be mandatory for NHS staff (p = 0.006). Fear of needles and believing their immune system is strong enough to protect against influenza were negatively correlated with vaccine uptake (p = 0.016 and p = 0.010, respectively). Job role was also strongly correlated with vaccine uptake (p = 0.001), with those holding a pharmacy degree more likely to report being vaccinated or intending to be vaccinated compared to all other pharmacy staff groups. Conclusions: This is the first survey to focus on vaccine behaviours of all pharmacy staff groups working in hospitals. Current uptake of the influenza vaccine may be increased through engagement of senior pharmacy colleagues and providing education on influenza, vaccines, and vaccination. Similar studies should be undertaken on a larger scale to fully interrogate the differences between pharmacy staff groups. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Vaccination with meningococcal outer membrane vesicles carrying Borrelia OspA protects against experimental Lyme borreliosis	VACCINE			English	Article						OMV; Vaccination; Borrelia; OspA; Lyme disease	ESCHERICHIA-COLI; A OSPA; RESPONSES; DISEASE; MICE; LIPOPROTEIN; CELLS; IMMUNOGENICITY; CANDIDATE; ENVELOPE	Currently there is no human vaccine against Lyme borreliosis, and most research focuses on recombinant protein vaccines, as such a vaccine has been proven to be successful in the past. The expression of recombinant antigens in meningococcal Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs), with theOMVfunctioning both as adjuvant and delivery vehicle, greatly enhances their potential. Immunization studies in mice have shown that OMV-based vaccines can protect against various pathogens and an OMV-based meningococcal vaccine is approved and available for human use. Because of its surface localization in Borrelia and the detailed knowledge regarding its immunogenicity and structure, OspA was chosen as a suitable lipoprotein to be tested as an OMV-based vaccine against Lyme borreliosis. We have previously shown that the OMV-OspA vaccine was immunogenic in mice and here we assessed the efficacy of OMV-OspA. We generated a second-generation OMV-OspA vaccine and vaccinated C3H/HeN mice with (EDTA extracted) meningococcal OMVs expressing OspA from B. burgdorferi strain B31. The adjuvant effect of empty OMVs on recombinant OspA was tested as well. We subsequently challenged mice with a subcutaneous injection of B. burgdorferi. Average antibody end-point titers against the OspA-OMV construct were high, although lower compared to the antibodies raised against recombinant OspA. Interestingly, antibody titers between recombinant OspA adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide and recombinant OspA with OMV as adjuvant were comparable. Finally, qPCR and culture data show that both the OspA-OMV and the vaccine based on recombinant OspA with OMV as adjuvant provided significant, yet partial protection, against Borrelia infection. OMV-based vaccines using Borrelia (lipo)proteins are an easy and feasible vaccination method protecting against B. burgdorferi infection and could be a promising strategy in humans.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of older adults was conducted using claims and hospital data in the United States. For clinical evaluations, adjusted analyses were conducted following inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to control for selection bias. Poisson regression was used to estimate the adjusted rVE against influenza-related hospitalizations/ER visits, influenza-related office visits, and any CRD-related hospitalizations/ER visits. For the economic evaluation, treatment selection bias was adjusted through 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM). All-cause and influenza-related costs associated with hospitalizations/ER, physician office and pharmacy visits were adjusted using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. Results: After IPTW and Poisson regression, aTIV (n = 561,315) was slightly more effective in reducing influenza-related office visits compared to TIV-HD (n = 1,672,779) (6.6%; 95% CI: 2.8-10.3%). aTIV was statistically comparable to TIV-HD (2.0%; 95% CI: -3.7%-7.3%) in preventing influenza-related hospitalizations/ER visits but more effective in reducing hospitalizations/ER visits for any CRD (2.6%; 95% CI: 2.0-3.2%). In the PSM-adjusted cohorts (n = 561,243 pairs), following GEE adjustments, predicted mean annualized all-cause and influenza-related total costs per patient were statistically similar between aTIV and TIV-HD (US$9676 vs. US$9625 and US$18.74 vs. US$17.28, respectively; both p > 0.05). Finally, influenza-related pharmacy costs were slightly lower for aTIV as compared to TIV-HD ($1.75 vs $1.85; p < 0.0001). Conclusions: During the 2018-19 influenza season, influenza-related hospitalization/ER visits and associated costs among people aged >= 65 were comparable between aTIV and TIV-HD. aTIV was slightly more effective in preventing influenza-related office visits and any CRD event as compared to TIV-HD in this population.

As vaccine hesitancy occurs along multiple dimensions, we used a social-ecological framework to guide the examination of COVID-19 vaccine intentions. Methods: Using an online survey in the US conducted in July 2020, we examined intentions to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, once available. 592 respondents provided data, including measures of demographics, vaccine history, social norms, perceived risk, and trust in sources of COVID-19 information. Bivariate and multivariate multinomial models were used to compare respondents who intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to respondents who did not intend or were ambivalent about COVID-19 vaccination. Results: Only 59.1% of the sample reported that they intended to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine. In the multivariate multinomial model, those respondents who did not intend to be vaccinated, as compared to those who did, had significantly lower levels of trust in the CDC as a source of COVID-19 information (aOR = 0.29, CI = 0.17-0.50), reported lower social norms of COVID-19 preventive behaviors (aOR = 0.67, CI 0.51-0.88), scored higher on COVID-19 Skepticism (aOR = 1.44, CI = 1.28-1.61), identified as more politically conservative (aOR = 1.23, CI = 1.05-1.45), were less likely to have obtained a flu vaccine in the prior year (aOR = 0.21, CI = 0.11-0.39), were less likely to be female (aOR = 0.51, CI = 0.29-0. 87), and were much more likely to be Black compared to White (aOR = 10.70, CI = 4.09-28.1). A highly similar pattern was observed among those who were ambivalent about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine compared to those who intended to receive one. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest several avenues for COVID-19 vaccine promotion campaigns, including social network diffusion strategies and cross-partisan messaging, to promote vaccine trust. The racial and gender differences in vaccine intentions also suggest the need to tailor campaigns based on gender and race. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

BUZZY (R), a vibratory stimulation tool with an ice pack, was reported to be an effective tool for reducing the pain caused to children during injection administration; its mechanisms were explained by gate control theory. However, the evidence is inadequate because of insufficient methodology in previous reports. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether the application of vibration would significantly reduce children's pain during vaccine injections. Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial recruiting children aged <= 6 years who were receiving vaccine injections was conducted between August and December 2019. If the children's parents consented to their participation, BUZZY (R) was attached to the child's arm prior to vaccination. BUZZY (R) was switched on before injection in the intervention group but not in the control group. The vaccination procedure was recorded, and researchers and parents assessed each child's pain using validated pain scales. Researchers conducted their assessment using video data to ensure blinding. Parents were administered a questionnaire after the children's vaccination. Data were analyzed using the t-test or chi-square test. Results: We analyzed 118 children (intervention group = 62, control = 56). No between-group difference was observed according to the researchers' assessment (mean score = 6.98 and 7.63, respectively; p = 0.25); however, a significant difference was found based on the parents' assessment (mean score = 7.39 versus 8.46; p = 0.02). Most responses received to open-ended questions were positive comments for this study. Conclusions: We revealed that the effect of vibration is not significant in reducing vaccine injection pain among children. Further studies are needed to examine the other components of BUZZY (R), which include its cooling effect, and the effect of BUZZY (R) itself in terms of whether children will undergo vaccination without resistance and have reduced trauma related to vaccination.

J	Williamson, JD; Gould, KG; Brown, K				Williamson, John D.; Gould, Keith G.; Brown, Kevin			Richard Pfeiffer's typhoid vaccine and Almroth Wright's claim to priority	VACCINE			English	Article						Typhoid vaccine; Priority; Pfeiffer; Wright; Leishman; Inoculation Department		Following the 1892 cholera pandemic, Richard Pfeiffer, Director of the science section of Robert Koch's Institute for Hygiene in Berlin, began laboratory-based studies on the pathogenesis of the disease using an animal model. These investigations resulted in his discovery of bacterial endotoxin; recognition of the bacteriolytic properties of both animal and human immune sera; and identification of the specific nature of protective immune responses. His research led naturally from cholera to typhoid fever and in November 1896 Pfeiffer published the results of experimental studies on a typhoid vaccine. In September 1896 Almroth Wright, a professor of pathology in the British Army Medical School, published a short note entitled "Typhoid Vaccination". It was appended to a review on the use of styptics to control defective blood coagulation: his previous research studies had a physiological basis that stemmed from earlier studies on tissue fibrinogen. In December 1895, Wright had been commissioned by the Army Medical Department to develop a typhoid vaccine and he later admitted that such work began only after he had spoken with Pfeiffer. In January 1897 Wright published a further paper in which he claimed precedence over Pfeiffer in the introduction of anti-typhoid vaccination. This self-entitlement has subsequently been accepted, primarily because the British Army approved typhoid vaccination in 1914 at the beginning of the First World War. That time has been used as their starting point by many of Wright's biographers, but without any attempt to confirm Wright's claim to priority. This paper concludes Richard Pfeiffer, not Almroth Wright, provided the first account of human typhoid vaccination. It also provides early examples of laboratory-based responses to pandemic and epidemic infectious diseases. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, vaccination coverage has remained around 42-49% during the past eight influenza seasons. We sought to quantify influenza vaccination coverage and factors associated with vaccination in persons seeking outpatient medical care for an acute respiratory illness (ARI). Methods: We enrolled outpatients aged >= 6 months with ARI from >50 U.S. clinics from 2011 to 2012 through 2018-2019 influenza seasons and tested for influenza with molecular assays. Vaccination status was based on documented receipt of the current season's influenza vaccine. We estimated vaccination coverage among influenza-negative study participants by study site, age, and season, and compared to state-level influenza coverage estimates in the general population based on annual immunization surveys. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine factors independently associated with receipt of influenza vaccines. Results: We enrolled 45,424 study participants with ARI who tested negative for influenza during the study period. Annual vaccination coverage among influenza-negative ARI patients and the general population in the participating states averaged 55% (range: 47-62%), and 52% (range: 46-54%), respectively. Among enrollees, coverage was highest among adults aged >= 65 years (82%; range, 80-85%) and lowest among adolescents aged 13-17 years (38%; range, 35-41%). Factors significantly associated with nonvaccination included non-White race, no college degree, exposure to cigarette smoke, absence of high-risk conditions, and not receiving prior season influenza vaccine. Conclusions: Influenza vaccination coverage over eight seasons among outpatients with non-influenza respiratory illness was slightly higher than coverage in the general population but 15% lower than national targets. Increased efforts to promote vaccination especially in groups with lower coverage are warranted to attain optimal health benefits of influenza vaccine. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The potential public health and economic value of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in the United States: Use of cost-effectiveness modeling to inform vaccination prioritization	VACCINE			English	Article						Coronavirus; COVID-19; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Economic analysis; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine		Background: Researchers are working at unprecedented speed to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We aimed to assess the value of a hypothetical vaccine and its potential public health impact when prioritization is required due to supply constraints. Methods: A Markov cohort model was used to estimate COVID-19 related direct medical costs and deaths in the United States (US), with and without implementation of a 60% efficacious vaccine. To prioritize the vaccine under constrained supply, the population was divided into tiers based on age; risk and age; and occupation and age; and outcomes were compared across one year under various supply assumptions. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus no vaccine was calculated for the entire adult population and for each tier in the three prioritization schemes. Results: The incremental cost per QALY gained for the US adult population was $8,200 versus no vaccination. For the tiers at highest risk of complications from COVID-19, such as those ages 65 years and older, vaccination was cost-saving compared to no vaccination. The cost per QALY gained increased to over $94,000 for those with a low risk of hospitalization and death following infection. Results were most sensitive to infection incidence, vaccine price, the cost of treating COVID-19, and vaccine efficacy. Under the most optimistic supply scenario, the hypothetical vaccine may prevent 31% of expected deaths. As supply becomes more constrained, only 23% of deaths may be prevented. In lower supply scenarios, prioritization becomes more important to maximize the number of deaths prevented. Conclusions: A COVID-19 vaccine is predicted to be good value for money (cost per QALY gained < $50,000).

Effect of provider recommendation style on the length of adolescent vaccine discussions	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine communication; Visit duration; Patient satisfaction	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION; PHYSICIAN COMMUNICATION; HPV VACCINE; CARE; PATIENT; PARENTS; RACE/ETHNICITY; INFORMATION; VISITS; IMPACT	Objective: To determine whether providers' vaccine recommendation style affects length of the adolescent vaccine discussions. Methods: We analyzed vaccine discussions using audio-recordings of clinical encounters where adolescents were eligible for HPV vaccines +/- meningococcal vaccines. We measured length of vaccine discussions, the provider's use of an "indicated" (vaccination due at visit) or "elective" (vaccination is optional) recommendation style, and vaccine receipt. Parent and child demographics, parental vaccination intentions, and parental satisfaction with vaccine discussion were collected from pre- and post-visit surveys. We used linear and logit regressions with random effects to estimate recommendation style's association with discussion length and with vaccine receipt, respectively. Results: We analyzed 106 vaccine discussions (82 HPV; 24 meningococcal) across 82 clinical encounters and 43 providers. Vaccine discussions were longer when providers presented vaccination as elective versus indicated (140 vs. 74 s; p-value < 0.001). Controlling for vaccine type, parental vaccination intent, and patient characteristics, an elective style was associated with 41 seconds longer vaccine discussion (p-value < 0.05). Providers used the indicated style more frequently with the meningococcal vaccine than with the HPV vaccine (96% vs. 72%; p-value < 0.05). Parents' odds of vaccinating were 9.3 times higher following an indicated versus an elective presentation (p-value < 0.05). Vaccine discussion length and presentation style were not associated with parental satisfaction. Conclusions: Our results suggest that using an indicated recommendation improves vaccine discussions' efficiency and effectiveness, but this style is used more often with meningococcal than HPV vaccines. Increasing providers' use of indicated styles for HPV vaccines has the potential to increase vaccination rates and save time during medical visits. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Development of an o-pthalaldehyde (OPA) assay to measure protein content in Ricin Vaccine E. coli (RVEc (TM))	VACCINE			English	Article						o-Pthalaldehyde; Ricin vaccine recombinant; Alhydrogel (R); Quantification		A recombinant ricin vaccine from E. coli (RVEc (TM)), was developed at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and assessed in an FDA sponsored Phase 1a clinical trial. At the maximum dosage, two of the study participants developed physiological responses that were elevated to the level of severe adverse reactions. To stay within safe dosing guidelines, the FDA recommended that an assay be developed to accurately quantify the recombinant protein content in the vaccine. The RVEc (TM) vaccine Final Drug Product (FDP) contains the adjuvant Alhydrogel (R), which by its colloidal nature interferes with most conventional protein assay methods. We decided to develop an assay measuring RVEc (TM) FDP using o-pthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent. The OPA reagent reacts to the primary amines and lysine side chains of proteins in the presence of a thiol under alkaline conditions with a quantifiable fluorescent signature, but does not react with Alhydrogel (R). Protein content in the RVEc (TM) FDP can be determined by comparing the fluorescence of the test sample to the fluorescence of a standard curve of defined concentration. Each phase of the assay was tested to optimize and simplify the assay procedure. The accuracy, specificity, reproducibility, and stability of the assay were evaluated. Results indicated that the optimized and modified OPA assay was simple and able to quantify antigen concentration from a standard curve in the 25 mu g/mL-600 mu g/mL range. The assay accuracy and coefficient of variation (CV) was 95% and less than 8%, respectively, when determining the ricin protein content in the 200 mg/mL vialed RVEc (TM) FDP. The assay was simple to perform and used conventional laboratory equipment. This assay could be adapted to measure the protein content in the FDP of other vaccines, but with the proviso that each step of the assay would need to be optimized for each antigen.

Typhimurium; fnr; arcA; fliC; Live attenuated vaccines; Protection	ANTIBODY-RESPONSE; GLOBAL BURDEN; INFECTION; VACCINES; DISEASE; IMMUNIZATION	Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a major food-borne pathogen that can cause self-limited gastroenteritis or life-threatening invasive diseases in humans. There is no licensed S. Typhimurium vaccine for humans to date. In this study, we attempted to construct a live attenuated vaccine strain of S. Typhimurium based on three genes, namely, the two global regulator genes fnr and arcA and the flagellin subunit gene fliC. The S. Typhimurium three-gene mutant, named SLT39 (Delta fnr Delta arcA Delta fliC), exhibited a high level of attenuation with a colonization defect in mouse tissues and approximately 10(4)-fold decreased virulence compared with that of the wild-type strain. To evaluate the immunogenicity and protection efficacy of STL39, mice were inoculated twice with a dose of 10(7) CFU or 10(8) CFU at a 28-day interval, and the immunized mice were challenged with a lethal dose of the wild-type S. Typhimurium strain one month post second immunization. Compared with mock immunization, SLT39 immunization with either dose elicited significant serum total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a and faecal IgA responses against inactivated S. Typhimurium antigens at a comparable level post second immunization, whereas the 10(8) CFU group induced higher levels of duodenal and caecal IgA than the 107 CFU group. Furthermore, the bacterial loads in mouse tissues, including Peyer's patches, spleen and liver, significantly decreased in the two SLT39 immunization groups compared to those in the control group post challenge. Additionally, all mice in the SLT39 (10(8) CFU) group and 80% of the mice in the SLT39 (10(7) CFU) group survived the lethal challenge, suggesting full protection and 80% protection efficacy, respectively.

Broad cross-national public support for accelerated COVID-19 vaccine trial designs	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Vaccine ethics; Challenge trials; Public opinion		A vaccine for COVID-19 is urgently needed. Several vaccine trial designs may significantly accelerate vaccine testing and approval, but also increase risks to human subjects. Concerns about whether the public would see such designs as ethical represent an important roadblock to their implementation; accordingly, both the World Health Organization and numerous scholars have called for consulting the public regarding them. We answered these calls by conducting a cross-national survey (n = 5920) in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The survey explained key differences between traditional vaccine trials and two accelerated designs: a challenge trial or a trial integrating a Phase II safety and immunogenicity trial into a larger Phase III efficacy trial. Respondents' answers to comprehension questions indicate that they largely understood the key differences and ethical trade-offs between the designs from our descriptions. We asked respondents whether they would prefer scientists to conduct traditional trials or one of these two accelerated designs. We found broad majorities prefer for scientists to conduct challenge trials (75%) and integrated trials (63%) over standard trials. Even as respondents acknowledged the risks, they perceived both accelerated trials as similarly ethical to standard trial designs. This high support is consistent across every geography and demographic subgroup we examined, including vulnerable populations. These findings may help assuage some of the concerns surrounding accelerated designs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SDM affects patient adherence, enhances patient knowledge, decreases decisional conflict and improves trust in the physician in most areas of health care. The shared decision making process (SDM process) is characterised by three key components: patient activation, bi-directional exchange of information and bidirectional deliberation of options. Objectives: To assess the impact of SDM processes on influenza vaccination rates in outpatient care patients. Methods: A systematic literature search in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, PsycINFO and ERIC was conducted (2020-02-05). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs, that aimed to improve influenza vaccination rates in adult patients in outpatient care were included. We examined effects of SDM processes on influenza vaccination rates by meta-analysis, and considered the extent of SDM processes in the analysed interventions and possible effect modifiers in subgroup analyses. Results: We included 21 studies, with interventions including face-to-face sessions, telephone outreach, home visits, Health Care Practitioner (HCP) trainings and supporting educational material. In 12 studies, interventions included all elements of a SDM process. A meta-analysis of 15 studies showed a positive effect on vaccination rates (OR of 1.96 (95% CI: 1.31 to 2.95)). Findings further suggest that interventions are effective across different patients groups and could increase effectiveness when the interaction is facilitated by multidisciplinary teams of HCP in comparison to interventions delivered by individual HCP. Discussion: This systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence that SDM processes can be an effective strategy to increase influenza vaccination rates. Further research with more detailed descriptions of SDM implementation modalities is necessary to better understand which components of SDM are most effective. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparison of influenza antibody titers among women who were vaccinated in the 2nd and the 3rd trimesters of pregnancy	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza vaccine; Cord blood; Antibody; Pregnant woman; Thailand	MATERNAL IMMUNIZATION; PHASE 4; A H1N1; PROTECTION; EFFICACY; INFANTS; MOTHERS; ILLNESS	Background: We compared cord blood antibody titers in unvaccinated pregnant women to those vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccine during the 2nd and the 3rd trimesters. Methods: Pregnant women had cord blood collected at delivery for hemagglutination inhibition assay against vaccine reference viruses: A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2), and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage). Geometric mean titer (GMT) ratios were calculated comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated pregnant women, and women vaccinated in the 2nd and the 3rd trimesters. Proportions of women achieving defined titers were compared using the chi(2) test. Results: Of 307 women, 190 (62%) were unvaccinated. Fifty and 67 were vaccinated during the 2nd and the 3rd trimesters, respectively. Median enrollment age was 29 years (interquartile range 24-34). Sixteen (5%) women had pre-existing conditions, but none were immunocompromised. GMT ratios comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated women were 5.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.06-6.96) for influenza A/California, 5.39 (95% CI 4.18-6.08) for influenza A/Switzerland, and 5.05 (95% CI 4.43-5.85) for influenza B/Phuket. Similarly, the GMT ratios comparing the 3rd and the 2nd trimester vaccinated women were 2.90 (95% CI 2.54-3.39), 2.82 (95% CI 2.56-3.13), and 2.83 (95% CI 2.56-3.14), respectively. The proportions of women with defined titers for the three vaccine reference viruses did not differ between 2nd and 3rd trimester vaccinated women (titers >= 40: 68-92% versus 70-93%; >= 110: 32% versus 33-63%; and >= 330: 4-10% versus 3-21%). Conclusions: Pregnant women vaccinated against influenza had more placental transfer of influenza antibodies to their infants than unvaccinated women. Placental transfer of antibodies was higher among those vaccinated in the 3rd trimester than in the 2nd trimester. There was no difference in the proportions of women achieving antibody titers corresponding to protection against influenza in children. Findings support the current World Health Organization's recommendation that pregnant women may be vaccinated in either 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Seroprevalence of meningococcal ACWY antibodies across the population in the Netherlands: Two consecutive surveys in 2016/17 and 2020	VACCINE			English	Article						Neisseria meningitidis; Serosurveillance; MenC vaccination; MenACWY vaccination; Herd immunity; the Netherlands	NEISSERIA-MENINGITIDIS SEROGROUP; C CONJUGATE VACCINE; UNITED-KINGDOM; PROTECTION; IMMUNITY; DISEASE; RESPONSES; OUTBREAKS; CORRELATE; ASSAY	Background: Meningococcal serogroup C (MenC) vaccination was introduced for 14-month-olds in the Netherlands in 2002, alongside a mass campaign for 1-18 year-olds. Due to an outbreak of serogroup W disease, MenC vaccination was replaced for MenACWY vaccination in 2018, next to introduction of a booster at 14 years of age and a catch-up campaign for 14-18 year-olds. We assessed meningococcal ACWY antibodies across the Dutch population in 2016/17 and 2020. Methods: In a nationwide cross-sectional serosurvey in 2016/17, sera from participants aged 0-89 years (n = 6886) were tested for MenACWY-polysaccharide-specific (PS) serum IgG concentrations, and functional MenACWY antibody titers were determined in subsets. Moreover, longitudinal samples collected in 2020 (n = 1782) were measured for MenACWY-PS serum IgG concentrations. Results: MenC antibody levels were low, except in recently vaccinated 14-23 month-olds and individuals who were vaccinated as teenagers in 2002, with seroprevalence of 59% and 20-46%, respectively. Meningococcal AWY antibody levels were overall low both in 2016/17 and in 2020. Naturally-acquired MenW immunity was limited in 2020 despite the recent serogroup W outbreak. Conclusions: This study demonstrates waning of MenC immunity 15 years after a mass campaign in the Netherlands. Furthermore, it highlights the lack of meningococcal AWY immunity across the population and underlines the importance of the recently introduced MenACWY (booster) vaccination. (c) 2021 The Authors.

A phase 3 trial of safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114, 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, compared with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in adults 50 years of age and older (PNEU-AGE)	VACCINE			English	Article						Pneumococcal vaccine; Safety; Immunogenicity	STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE; POLYSACCHARIDE VACCINE; DISEASE; EFFICACY; BURDEN; IMPACT; INFECTION; CARRIAGE; CHILDREN; OUTCOMES	Background: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have greatly reduced the incidence of pneumococcal disease, yet unmet medical need remains due to increased disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes (STs). V114 (VAXNEUVANCETM, Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA) is a 15-valent PCV containing 13 serotypes in licensed PCV13 and 2 additional serotypes (22F, 33F) which significantly contribute to pneumococcal disease burden. This phase 3 trial compared safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V114 to PCV13 in adults >50 years of age. Methods: Adults were randomized 1:1 to receive a single dose of V114 or PCV13; randomization was stratified by age (50-64 years, 65-74 years, and >75 years). Adverse events (AEs) were collected following vaccination. Serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were measured prior to and 30 days after vaccination (Day 30). Primary objectives included assessing noninferiority of V114 to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes and superiority of V114 to PCV13 for the two unique serotypes. Superiority of V114 to PCV13 for shared serotype 3 was assessed as a secondary objective. Results: Overall, 1,202 participants were vaccinated (V114 N = 602, PCV13 N = 600). The most commonly reported AEs across both groups were injection-site pain, fatigue, and myalgia. V114 met noninferiority criteria compared to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes (using a 2-fold non-inferiority margin for the ratio of OPA geometric mean titers [GMTs] [V114/PCV13] at Day 30) and met superiority for the 2 unique serotypes (using a 2-fold super-superiority margin for the ratio of OPA GMTs [V114/PCV13] at Day 30 and a 0.10 super-superiority margin for the difference in proportions of participants with >4-fold rise from prevaccination to Day 30). V114 met superiority criteria compared to PCV13 for serotype 3 (based on a super-superiority margin of 1.2 for the ratio of the OPA GMTs [V114/PCV13] and a superiority margin of 0 for the difference in proportions of participants with >4-fold rise).

Humoral and cellular immune memory response 12 years following single dose vaccination against hepatitis A in Argentinian children	VACCINE			English	Article						Hepatitis A Virus; Vaccination; Immunity; Memory Response	IMMUNIZATION; VIRUS; CIRCULATION; SEROPREVALENCE; PERSISTENCE; INFECTION; CELLS	Infants' universal hepatitis A virus (HAV) single-dose vaccination has been highly effective for controlling HAV infection in Argentina, and in other Latin-American countries that adopted that strategy. Although antibodies wane over time, this has not been associated with HAV outbreaks or breakthrough infections, suggesting a relevant role for memory immunity. This study assessed long term humoral and cellular immune memory response after an average of 12 years follow-up of HAV single-dose vaccination. We selected 81 HAV-single dose vaccinated individuals from a 2015 study, including 54 with unprotective (UAL) and 27 with protective antibody levels (PAL) against HAV. Humoral memory response was assessed by measuring anti-HAV antibody titers at admission in both groups, and 30 days after a booster dose in the UAL group. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples stimulated with HAV antigen was performed in 47/81 individuals (21 with PAL, 26 with UAL) to identify activated CD4 + memory T cells or CD8 + memory T cells. The results showed that 48/52 (92%) individuals from UAL group who completed follow up reached protective levels after booster dose. In the PAL group, anti-HAV Abs waned in 2/27 (7%) individuals lacking seroprotection, while in 25/27 (93%) Abs remained >10 mUI/mL. HAV-specific memory CD4 + T cells were detected in 25/47 (53.2%) subjects while HAVspecific memory CD8 + T cells were observed in 16/47 (34.04%) individuals. HAV-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were detected in 11/21 (52.4%) and in 9/21 (42.9%) subjects with PAL and in 14/26 (53.8%) and in 7/26 (26.9%) individuals with UAL, showing that the presence of memory T-cells was independent of the level or presence of anti-HAV antibodies. Long-term immunity demonstrated in the present work, including or not antibody persistence, suggests that individuals with waned Ab titers may still be protected and supports the single-dose HAV strategy.

Despite this recommendation, influenza vaccine among pregnant individuals remains under-utilized and uptake varies by country. Factors associated with influenza vaccine uptake during pregnancy may also vary across coun-tries. Methods: As members of the Pregnancy Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (PREVENT), five sites from four countries (Australia, Canada, Israel, and the United States) retrospectively identified cohorts of individ-uals aged 18-50 years who were pregnant during pre-defined influenza seasons. Influenza vaccine coverage estimates were calculated for the 2010-11 through 2015-16 northern hemisphere and the 2012 through 2015 southern hemisphere influenza seasons, by site. Sites used electronic health records, administrative data, and immunization registries to collect information on pregnancy, health history, demographics, and vaccination status. Each season, vaccination coverage was calculated as the percentage of individuals who received influenza vaccine among the individuals in the cohort that season. Characteristics were com-pared between those vaccinated and unvaccinated, by site. Results: More than two million pregnancies were identified over the study period. Influenza vaccination coverage ranged from 5% to 58% across sites and seasons. Coverage increased consistently over the study period at three of the five sites (Western Australia, Alberta, and Israel), and was highest in all seasons at the United States study site (39-58%). Associations with vaccination varied by country and across seasons; where available, parity >0, presence of a high-risk medical condition, and urban residence were consistently associated with increased likelihood of vaccination. Conclusions: Though increasing, uptake of influenza vaccine among pregnant individuals remains lower than recommended. Coverage varied substantially by country, suggesting an ongoing need for targeted strategies to improve influenza vaccine uptake in this population. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Persuasive messaging to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions	VACCINE			English	Article							INFLUENZA VACCINATION; HEALTH BEHAVIOR; SELF-INTEREST; MORAL VALUES; EVOLUTION; ALTRUISM; EMOTIONS; PREDICT; REGRET	Widespread vaccination remains the best option for controlling the spread of COVID-19 and ending the pandemic. Despite the considerable disruption the virus has caused to people's lives, many people are still hesitant to receive a vaccine. Without high rates of uptake, however, the pandemic is likely to be pro-longed. Here we use two survey experiments to study how persuasive messaging affects COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions. In the first experiment, we test a large number of treatment messages. One subgroup of messages draws on the idea that mass vaccination is a collective action problem and high-lighting the prosocial benefit of vaccination or the reputational costs that one might incur if one chooses not to vaccinate. Another subgroup of messages built on contemporary concerns about the pandemic, like issues of restricting personal freedom or economic security. We find that persuasive messaging that invokes prosocial vaccination and social image concerns is effective at increasing intended uptake and also the willingness to persuade others and judgments of non-vaccinators. We replicate this result on a nationally representative sample of Americans and observe that prosocial messaging is robust across subgroups, including those who are most hesitant about vaccines generally. The experiments demonstrate how persuasive messaging can induce individuals to be more likely to vaccinate and also create spillover effects to persuade others to do so as well.

Adequate planning is critical to the success of a vaccination campaign. To achieve a quality SIA implementation for effective interruption of measles transmission, the World Health Organization introduced the SIA Readiness Assessment Tool, which includes the readiness dashboard. It is a strategic planning tool used to ensure critical activities are completed before SIAs. Nigeria implemented a phased measles SIA in 2017/2018 and used the readiness assessment tool in the planning for the campaign. In this article, we report the use of the readiness assessment dashboard in the 2017/2018 measles SIA, we also reviewed its contributions to the outcome of the campaign looking at the post campaign coverage survey results for the states. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of the readiness assessment dashboard used during the 2017/2018 measles vaccination campaign in Nigeria. The readiness dashboard tool was designed using Microsoft Excel 2016. We reported results in frequencies and proportions using charts and tables. Results: The states with 100% readiness a week prior to the campaign scored a post campaign coverage survey result of 84.6 - 96.5% with just one out of the eight states in this category getting a score below 90%. In the same vein, of the eight states that their readiness score at one week to the campaign was below 85%, six had post campaign coverage survey score of less than 90% with the highest score in this category being 92.3%. Some states with good readiness scores also had poor post campaign coverage survey which has been attributed to other factors other than readiness. Conclusion: The readiness assessment dashboard for the measles vaccination campaign provided a platform for tracking states readiness. It is our view that a link between readiness assessment and coverage should be examined in future studies. (C) 2021 World Health Organization. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In December 2020 the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine was approved in the United States. This study describes the first BNT162b2 vaccine dose effect on a large cohort. Methods: This retrospective study examined first vaccine dose effect on serology and investigated the associations between seroconversion and age or sex. Results: Serological blood tests were performed on 1898 participants following first vaccine dose; 81% were tested on day 21, before receiving the second dose (mean age 47.5 +/- 12.45; median 47.7, range 18-90). Positive serology was found in 92.7% of day 21 tests. Overall positivity was 86.8%, with rates increasing from 2.5% within 1-14 days to 89.8% (14-20 days), 92.7% (21 days), and 95.9% (>21 days). Mean antibody levels 21 days after first dose were 64.3 +/- 33.01 AU/ml, (range 15-373 AU/ml, median 61 AU/ml). Seropositivity was greater in females than males (88.3%. vs 83.3% respectively, p < 0.001; OR1.515; 95% CI 1.152-1.994). Older age > 60 years was associated with decreased likelihood of seropos-itivity (p < 0.001; OR 0.926; 95% CI 0.911-0.940). Longer time between first vaccination and serology tests was associated with increased likelihood for seropositivity (p < 0.001; OR 1.350; 95% CI 1.298-1.404). Conclusions: The high seroconversion rate following first BNT162b2 dose among individuals < 60 may justify delayed delivery of the second dose, potentially help relieve the worldwide vaccination supply shortage, enable vaccination of twice this population within a shorter period, and ultimately reduce COVID-19 contagion.

Safety and immunogenicity of a multidose vial formulation of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine administered with routine pediatric vaccines in healthy infants in India: A phase 4, randomized, open-label study	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine; Clinical trial; Pneumococcal conjugate; Children; Infant; Multidose	STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE; B DISEASE; CHILDREN; BURDEN	Purpose: This phase 4, randomized, open-label, multicenter study in healthy Indian infants and toddlers evaluated the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) formulated in a multidose vial (MDV) or single prefilled syringe (PFS). Methods: Healthy Indian infants (6 weeks of age) were randomized 1:1 to receive either PCV13-MDV or PCV13-PFS concomitant with routine pediatric vaccines. Subjects received a single dose of either PCV13MDV or PCV13-PFS as a 4-dose schedule (infant series: 1 dose at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age; toddler dose: 12 months of age). Safety was assessed, including local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events (AEs). Immunogenicity 1 month after both the infant series and toddler dose was measured by concentrations of serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and opsonophagocytic activity titers. Results: Rates and severities of local reactions and systemic events up to 7 days after each dose of either PCV13-MDV or PCV13-PFS were generally similar, with the majority being of mild or moderate severity. PCV13-MDV had a safety profile comparable with PCV13-PFS; both groups experienced a similar frequency of AEs. PCV13-MDV elicited immune responses comparable with those induced by PCV13-PFS. Clear boosting of immune responses after the PCV13-MDV toddler dose was observed; >96% of subjects showed serotype-specific IgG concentrations at or above the defined thresholds 1 month after the PCV13MDV toddler dose. Conclusions: PCV13-MDV was safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic in healthy Indian infants and toddlers when coadministered with routine pediatric vaccinations. Safety and immunogenicity of PCV13MDV was comparable with PCV13-PFS. Clinical Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03548337. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Persisting antibody responses to Vi polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate (Typbar TCV (R)) vaccine up to 7 years following primary vaccination of children < 2 years of age with, or without, a booster vaccination	VACCINE			English	Article						Salmonella Typhi; Typhoid fever; Enteric fever typhoid conjugate vaccine; Conjugate vaccine; Anti microbial resistance	TYPHOID-FEVER; SALMONELLA-TYPHI; EFFICACY; TRIAL; IMMUNOGENICITY; BURDEN	Background: Serum IgG anti-Vi titers attained by 327 children 6-23 months of age immunized with Vi polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (Typbar TCV (R)), of whom 193/327 received a booster dose 2 years post-primary vaccination, were previously reported. Methods: Anti-Vi IgG in boosted and unboosted children 3, 5, and 7 years post-primary immunization were monitored using three different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs): Vacczyme (TM) kit ELISA (all specimens); "Szu" ELISA (all specimens), and National Institute of Biological Standards NIBSC ELISA (subset). Endpoints analyzed included: persisting seroconversion (titer remaining >= 4-fold above baseline), geometric mean titer (GMT), geometric mean-fold rise post-vaccination, and percent exhibiting putative protective anti-Vi level (>= 2 mu g(Szu)/ml) using Szu method and National Institutes of Health IgG reference standard. In assessing the persistence of elevated anti-Vi titers stimulated by Typbar-TCV (R), four subgroups were compared based on whether or not the initially enrolled children were boosted on day 720 and whether they provided serum on all key timepoints, or if they missed one or more timepoints: i) Among boosted participants, an "All Specimens Cohort" (ASC) comprised 86 children who provided sera on days 42, 720 (booster), 762 (42 days post-booster), 1095, 1825 and 2555, to define kinetics of the Vi antibody response in a fully compliant cohort of boosted children monitored over seven years; ii) Among non-boosted subjects, a compliant All Specimens Cohort of 25 children provided sera on days 0, 42, 720, 1095, 1825, and 2555; iii) Among boosted children, an "Any Available Specimen" (AAS) subgroup consisted of boosted children who provided sera on days 0, 42, and 720 days and also on one or more of days 762, 1095, 1825, or 2555 but not on all those time points; iv) Among the non-boosted subjects, there was also an Any Available Specimen subgroup of 47 children who provided sera on days 0 and 42, of whom 41 subsequently contributed sera on one or more of days 1095, 1825 and 2555. Results: Vacczyme (TM) GMTs among boosted ASC children (N = 86) increased significantly on day 762, and remained 32-fold, 14-fold, and 10-fold over baseline at 3, 5 and 7 years; among unboosted ASC children (N = 25), GMTs remained 21-fold, 8-fold and 5-fold over baseline, respectively. Post-primary vaccination, 72% and 44% of unboosted ASC subjects (N = 25) exhibited persisting seroconversion by Vacczyme (TM) at 5 and 7 years, respectively; the corresponding numbers for ASC boosted subjects were 84% and 71%. Amongst the four sub-groups, boosted subjects showed higher prevalence of persisting seroconversion at most time points with the gap widening by 7th year, though not statistically significant (except 3rd year). Tested by Szu and also NIBSC ELISAs, 92-100% of unboosted ASC children showed persisting seroconversion at 7 years with 100% also exceeding the Szu protective threshold. Conclusion: To extend protection, administering a booster of Typbar TCV (R) to children-5 years after their primary dose, i.e., coinciding with school entry, may be advisable. Typbar TCV (R) is presently the only WHO pre-qualified Vi conjugate vaccine with reported efficacy, effectiveness, and long-term immunogenicity findings. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

In 2012, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Vaccine Action Plan that set a target to eliminate Measles-Rubella (MR) in five of the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions by 2020. This was cross-sectional study employed both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The sample size was calculated to provide overall, age-and sex-specific coverage estimates for MR vaccine among children aged between 9 and 59 months at the national level. Using desired precision of +/- 5% with an expected coverage of 95%, a total of 15,235 households were required. The age of children, a child who had received the MR vaccine before the campaign, household wealth quintile, the age of caregivers, and their marital status were associated with non-coverage of MR vaccination among children aged 9-59 months in Tanzania. Nationally, an estimated 88.2% (95% CI: 87.3- 89%) of children aged 9-59 months received the MR campaign dose, as assessed by caregivers' recall. These estimates revealed slightly higher coverage in Zanzibar 89.6% (95% CI: 84.7-93%) compared to Mainland Tanzania 88.1% (95% CI 87.2-88.9%). These associated factors revealed causes of unvaccinated children and may be some of the reasons for Tanzania's failure to meet the MR campaign target of 95 percent vaccination coverage. Thus, vaccine development must increase programmatic oversight in order to improve immunization activities and communication strategies in Tanzanian areas with low MR coverage.

Although they are protective against lethal infections, the efficacy of these vaccines has been divergent. The manufacturing process often involves the use of standard bacterial strains subjected to serial in vitro passages, with a risk of loss of virulence, and may affect the immunogenicity and consequently decrease protection. Thus, the objective of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of the efficacy of in-house bacterins produced with standard (avirulent) and virulent strains. Hamsters were immunized with killed bacteria produced using avirulent and virulent strains of L. interrogans serovars Copenhageni and Canicola. Vaccine efficacy was determined in terms of protection against lethal homologous or heterologous challenges. The results showed that immunization with both avirulent and virulent Canicola strains resulted in 100% protection against homologous challenge. Conversely, Copenhageni bacterins produced using an avirulent strain conferred only 25-37.5% protection against homologous challenge (P > 0.05), while virulent Copenhageni bacterin conferred 100% protection (P < 0.001). A single vaccine dose was sufficient to induce protection, and administration of a prime boost significantly reduced the bacterial load in the kidneys and improved the humoral immune response to the virulent Copenhageni strain. These findings suggest that the maintenance of virulent strains in bacterin formulations is essential for improving the immunogenicity and efficacy of leptospirosis vaccines. CO 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Enhancing influenza vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy through infection mimicry using silk microneedles	VACCINE			English	Article						Silk fibroin; Influenza vaccine; Microneedle; Infection mimicry; Sustained release	SEASONAL INFLUENZA; ANTIBODY-RESPONSES; NANOPARTICLE VACCINES; ANTIGEN; RELEASE; STABILIZATION; DELIVERY; IMMUNIZATION; INJECTION; FIBROIN	Traditional bolus vaccine administration leads to rapid clearance of vaccine from lymphoid tissue. However, there is increasing evidence suggesting that the kinetics of antigen delivery can impact immune responses to vaccines, particularly when tailored to mimic natural infections. Here, we present the speci-fic enhancements sustained release immunization confers to seasonal influenza vaccine, including the magnitude, durability, and breadth of humoral responses. To achieve sustained vaccine delivery kinetics, we have developed a microneedle array patch (MIMIX), with silk fibroin-formulated vaccine tips designed to embed in the dermis after a short application to the skin and release antigen over 1-2 weeks, mimicking the time course of a natural influenza infection. In a preclinical murine model, a single influ-enza vaccine administration via MIMIX led to faster seroconversion, response-equivalence to prime -boost bolus immunization, higher HAI titers against drifted influenza strains, and improved protective efficacy upon lethal influenza challenge when compared with intramuscular injection. These results high -light infection mimicry, achieved through sustained release silk microneedles, as a powerful approach to improve existing seasonal influenza vaccines, while also suggesting the broader potential of this platform technology to enable more efficacious next-generation vaccines and vaccine combinations.

Pre-existing immunity to cytomegalovirus in macaques influences human CMV vaccine responses in preclinical models	VACCINE			English	Article						Cytomegalovirus; mRNA vaccine; glycoprotein B; Pentameric complex	MESSENGER-RNA VACCINES; GLYCOPROTEIN B; INFECTION; ANTIBODIES	Development of a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) vaccine is a Tier 1 priority by the National Institutes of Medicine, as HCMV is the most common congenital infection globally and most frequent infectious complication in transplant patients. Relevant preclinical non-human primate models used for testing HCMV vaccine immunogenicity are rhesus and cynomolgous monkeys. However, a complication in using these models is that species-specific CMV variants are endemic in non-human primate breeding colonies. We hypothesize that natural immunity to species-specific CMV in rhesus and cynomolgous monkeys impacts HCMV vaccine immunogenicity and may interfere with our ability to fully interpret vaccine immunogenicity. A modified mRNA vaccine encoding HCMV glycoprotein (gB) and the pentameric complex (PC) packaged in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) was delivered intramuscularly to groups of cynomolgous (n = 16, CyCMV-seropositive) and rhesus macaques (n = 24, RhCMV-seropositive). High pre-vaccination IgG binding responses to HCMV gB were present in both species, but pre-vaccination binding responses to PC were mostly present in rhesus macaques. Yet, at least a log increase in both PC and gB-specific plasma IgG levels was detected post-second HCMV mRNA vaccination in both species. Both species responded with high epithelial cell neutralizing antibody responses at 4 weeks post second HCMV mRNA vaccination, but limited fibroblast neutralizing antibodies. HCMV gB + PC mRNA/LNP vaccine also elicited IgG binding responses to cell-associated gB, an identified immune correlate of protection, in both species after the second vaccination, and there was a moderately strong direct correlation between this pre-and post-vaccination response in rhesus macaques. Based on the correlation between pre-existing and post-vaccine gB-specific binding responses in rhesus macaques, we conclude that species-specific CMV variant-specific antibody responses contribute to antibody responses to HCMV vaccination in primate models, indicating that pre-existing immunity must be taken into account in non-human primate preclinical models and will impact immunogenicity of HCMV vaccines seropositive human vaccinees.

Current FDA and manufacturer guidelines mandate intramuscular administration of these vaccines, as other administration routes may not provide the same levels of effectiveness and safety. Observing the vast amount of published media images of persons receiving their vaccines, the authors noted in many cases the injection technique involved skin bunching, raising concerns of inadequate deltoid muscle penetration and consequent lowered vaccine efficacy. Our study hypothesis was that skin bunching will increase the skin-to-muscle distance over 20 mm, the maximal distance allowing the required 5 mm muscle penetration with a 25 mm needle. Materials and methods: 60 adult volunteers from our hospital staff were recruited, and using ultrasound, the skin-to-muscle distance measured in three positions: flat, skin bunching and muscle bunching. The skin-to-muscle distance difference and correlation with gender and BMI were calculated. Results: Skin bunching significantly increased the skin-to-muscle distance in all subjects. In 6 (10%) subjects, this increase exceeded the 20 mm limit. Having a skin-to-deltoid distance of 20 mm or more strongly correlated with a BMI of 30 or more. Conclusions: Skin bunching will prevent adequate intramuscular injection of vaccines in a small percentage of persons, but as hundreds of millions are expected to receive mRNA vaccines in the coming months, the multiplied result can have significant personal and societal consequences for millions of people globally, especially in obese populations, and therefore this practice should be strictly discouraged.

Viral and bacterial coinfections (VBC) are common complications in patients with seasonal influenza and are associated with around 25% of all influenza-related deaths. The burden of pneumonia in patients with VBC in Spain is poorly characterized. To address this question, we aimed to provide population data over a period of six consecutive influenza seasons, from 2009-10 to 2014-15. Methods: We used the discharge report from the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS), published annually by the Spanish Ministry of Health, to retrospectively analyse hospital discharge data in individuals aged >60 years with a diagnosis of pneumonia and influenza, based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM codes 480-486 and 487-488, respectively), from 1 October 2009 to 30 September 2015. Results: In total, 1933 patients >60 years old were hospitalized for pneumonia and influenza, of whom 55.2% were male. The median age was 74 years (interquartile range [IRQ] 15); half of the patients were >75 years old. Influenza was the main diagnosis in 64.4% of the patients, and all-cause pneumonia in 15.8%, half of whom were assigned a diagnostic code for pneumococcal pneumonia. The mean annual hos-pitalization rate was 2.99 per 100,000 population (95% CI 2.9-3.1) throughout the study period, while the highest rate, 5.6 per 100,000 population (95% CI 5.2-6.0), was observed in the 2013-14 season. The mean annual mortality rate was 0.5 deaths per 100,000 population (95% CI 0.4-0.6) and in-hospital case fatality rate was 16.1% (95% CI 14.5-17.8). Conclusions: In Spain, community-acquired pneumonia and influenza continue to be an important cause of hospitalization and mortality in patients over 60 years of age. There is an urgent need to further develop pre-vention strategies such as joint vaccination for both pathologies. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In India, the state of Assam alone contributes more than one-third of the national burden of JE. Between 2011 and 2014, a single dose of JE vaccine SA 14-14-2 (LAJEV) was administered among adults aged 15-65 years residing in Sivasagar and Dibrugarh districts of Assam, India. We monitored the trend of JE incidence between 2009 and 2018 using JE surveillance data, estimated the long-term effectiveness of the single dose of LAJEV and estimated the coverage of JE vaccine in two districts. Methods: We compared the JE vaccination status of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized JE patients (case) and age, sex and locality matched healthy individuals (controls) to estimate the effectiveness of single dose of JE vaccine. We used surveillance data for 2009-2018 to calculate the incidence of JE among adults. We conducted a community-based survey to estimate the coverage of JE vaccine in the two districts. Results: A total of 452 laboratory-confirmed JE case-patients and 904 matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study between 2012 and 2018. The effectiveness of a single dose of JE vaccine over the 7-year period was 77.0 (95% CI: 67.0-83.0). Vaccine effectiveness decreased from 91% (95% CI: 73.0- 97.0) in first year of vaccination to 71% (95% CI: 21.0-90.0) at six years post-vaccination. The incidence of adults JE cases declined from 10.5 per 100,000 in the pre-vaccination period to 5.7 per 100,000 in the years following vaccination. The coverage of vaccine among adults in two districts was 40.1% (36.8-43.5). Conclusions: A single dose of JE vaccine offered adequate protection for at least six years. Conducting mass vaccination campaigns periodically would further reduce the incidence of JE in endemic districts in Assam. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, some outbreaks with cases imported from abroad were reported even after certification. A large rubella outbreak has been occurring since 2017. This study examines measurement of the speed of attenuation of antibody titer for a measles virus comparison with rubella virus. Method: Student subjects born from April 2, 1996 through April 1, 2000 were selected at Ibaraki Prefectural University of Health Sciences for this study: 177 for measles and 114 for rubella. They had available dates of additional immunization and antibodies in the following period and were judged as requiring additional immunization. We used enzyme immunoassay for IgG antibody testing. We regressed post-antibody titers of measles or rubella on pre-antibody titers and functions of duration between inoculation to post-evaluation. Functions of duration were selected according to the adjusted coefficient of determination. Results: For measles, only a linear term of duration or log of duration was found to be significant without the quadratic terms. For rubella, we selected a five-order linear model which indicated that titer after vaccination would converge to 19.2. Discussion: Results demonstrate that measles antibody decreased monotonically. If the pre-antibody titer was 15, vaccination raised titer quickly to 26; then it attenuated by 0.014 per day. Antibody titer is expected to be less than 16, which is the protection level of titer, after 704 days. For rubella, however, when pre-vaccination titer was evaluated at its average, the lower limit was 19.2. Therefore, protection can be maintained for a long time. This difference might reflect some circumstances of outbreaks of the respective diseases. Conclusion. This report describes the speed of attenuation and the epidemiological situation. The speed of attenuation can be expected to rise. Therefore, additional vaccination every several years might be necessary to maintain a protection level if a disease is almost eliminated.

Estimating pertussis incidence in general practice using a large Australian primary care database	VACCINE			English	Article						Pertussis; General practice; Incidence; Healthcare-seeking; Underestimation	DIAGNOSIS; VACCINE; DISEASES	Background: While pertussis is notifiable in most countries, notifications typically underestimate the true pertussis burden. We explored the incidence of pertussis in general practice in Australia. Methods: Using MedicineInsight, a large longitudinal electronic medical record database of general practice (primary care) encounters which includes >1.5 million patients, we first defined a cohort of active patients and then used free-text search algorithms to identify patients with pertussis-related encounters. We defined and identified pertussis-related encounters in four patient categories: pertussis-associated (category 1), potential pertussis (category 2), epidemiologically-linked pertussis (category 3), and symptoms consistent with pertussis (category 4). Incident pertussis-related encounter rates per 100,000 active patients were calculated from Jan 2008 to Aug 2015. Results: Estimated mean annual pertussis incidence increased as definitions were expanded, from 94.3 (category 1 patients only) to 148.8 (categories 1+2+3 patients combined) per 100,000 active patients per year. Monthly time-series corresponding to the first three categories were highly correlated (Pearson's r > 90% for each pair), but each was poorly correlated with category 4. For categories 1+2+3, the highest incidence was among 0-4 and 5-9 year olds. Incidence was 30% higher in females than males (i.e. 184.5 vs 139.8 per 100,00 active patients for categories 1-3 patients combined). Pertussis-associated incidence (category 1) was similar to national pertussis notification rates. Categories 2 and 3 added 25% and 33%, respectively, on average relative to category 1 incidence. The estimated incidence from categories 1+2+3 together were on average 64% higher than national pertussis notification rates. Conclusion: We provide comprehensive estimates of pertussis-related incidence in general practice (primary care), well in excess of notified pertussis incidence in Australia. This highlights the utility of MedicineInsight data in providing a greater understanding of the burden of medically-attended pertussis infections. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Immunogenicity and safety of two monovalent rotavirus vaccine, ROTAVAC (R) and ROTAVAC 5D (R) in Zambian infants	VACCINE			English	Article						Rotavirus Vaccine; ROTAVAC; ROTAVAC 5D; Safety; Immunogenicity; Zambia	DOUBLE-BLIND; LESS-THAN-5 YEARS; 116E; LIVE; CHILDREN; REASSORTANT; EFFICACY; TRIAL	Background and aims: ROTAVAC(R) (frozen formulation stored at -20 degrees C) and ROTAVAC 5D(R) (liquid formulation stable at 2-8 degrees C) are rotavirus vaccines derived from the 116E human neonatal rotavirus strain, developed and licensed in India. This study evaluated and compared the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines in an infant population in Zambia. Methods: We conducted a phase 2b, open-label, randomized, controlled trial wherein 450 infants 6 to 8 weeks of age were randomized equally to receive three doses of ROTAVAC or ROTAVAC 5D, or two doses of ROTARIX(R). Study vaccines were administered concomitantly with routine immunizations. Blood samples were collected pre-vaccination and 28 days after the last dose. Serum anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies were measured by ELISA, with WC3 and 89-12 rotavirus strains as viral lysates in the assays. The primary analysis was to assess non-inferiority of ROTAVAC 5D to ROTAVAC in terms of the geometric mean concentration (GMC) of serum IgA (WC3) antibodies. Seroresponse and seropositivity were also determined. Safety was evaluated as occurrence of immediate, solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events after each dose. Results: The study evaluated 388 infants in the per-protocol population. All three vaccines were well tolerated and immunogenic. The post-vaccination GMCs were 14.0 U/mL (95% CI: 10.4, 18.8) and 18.1 U/mL (95% CI: 13.7, 24.0) for the ROTAVAC and ROTAVAC 5D groups, respectively, yielding a ratio of 1.3 (95% CI: 0.9, 1.9), thus meeting the pre-set non-inferiority criteria. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events were similar across all study arms. No death or intussusception case was reported during study period. Conclusions: Among Zambian infants, both ROTAVAC and ROTAVAC 5D were well tolerated and the immunogenicity of ROTAVAC 5D was non-inferior to that of ROTAVAC. These results are consistent with those observed in licensure trials in India and support use of these vaccines across wider geographical areas. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Missed childhood immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil: Analyses of routine statistics and of a national household survey	VACCINE			English	Article						Immunization coverage; Economic status; Public health; Covid; 19	HEALTH; AFRICA	Introduction: There is widespread concern that disruption to health services during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to declines in immunization coverage among young children, but there is limited information on the magnitude of such impact. High immunization coverage is essential for reducing the risk of vaccine preventable diseases. Methods: We used data from two nationwide sources covering the whole of Brazil. Data from the Information System of the National Immunization Program (SIPNI) on the monthly number of vaccine doses administered to young children were analyzed. The second source was a survey in 133 large cities in the 27 states in the country, carried out from August 24-27. Respondents answered a question on whether children under the age of three years had missed any scheduled vaccinations during the pandemic, and available vaccination cards were photographed for later examination. Results: SIPNI data showed that, relative to January and February 2020, there was a decline of about 20% in vaccines administered to children aged two months or older during March and April, when social distancing was at the highest level in the country. After May, vaccination levels returned to pre-pandemic values. Survey data, based on the interviews and on examination of the vaccine cards, showed that 19.0% (95% CI 17.0;21.1%) and 20.6% (95% CI 19.0;23.1%) of children, respectively, had missed immunizations. Missed doses were most common in the North (Amazon) region and least common in the South and Southeast, and also more common among children from poor than from wealthy families. Interpretation: Our results show that the pandemic was associated with a reduction of about 20% in child vaccinations, but this was reverted in recent months. Children from poor families and from the least developed regions of the country were most affected. There is an urgent need to booster immunization activities in the country to compensate for missed doses, and to reduce geographic and socioeconomic inequalities. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to assess HPV vaccination rates during the pandemic, and conduct a simulation model-based analysis to estimate the impact of current coverage and future pandemic recovery scenarios on disease outcomes. The model population included females and males of all ages in the US. The model compares pre-COVID vaccine uptake to 3 reduced coverage scenarios with varying recovery speed. Vaccine coverage was obtained from Truven Marketscan (TM). Substantially reduced coverage between March-August 2020 was observed compared to 2018-2019. The model predicted that 130,853 to 213,926 additional cases of genital warts; 22,503 to 48,157 cases of CIN1; 48,682 to 110,192 cases of CIN2/3; and 2,882 to 6,487 cases of cervical cancer will occur over the next 100 years, compared to status quo. Providers should plan efforts to recover HPV vaccination and minimize potential long-term consequences. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The present post-marketing trial was implemented in China to assess the immunogenicity and safety of replacing the Salk IPV with the Sabin IPV in the last two immunizations of the standard three-dose schedule. Methods: We conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial with two groups that received three doses of IPVs at the age of 2, 3, and 4 months: the Salk-Sabin-Sabin group and the Salk-Salk-Salk group. Blood samples were collected before vaccination and 30-40 days after the third dose of vaccination. The seroconversion rates and antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) were calculated and analyzed to evaluate immunogenicity. The safety of both immunization schedules was also monitored and analyzed. Results: Of 360 recruited healthy infants, all three IPV doses were administered and blood collection was completed in 330 infants. All participants (100%) in both groups were seropositive for all three poliovirus types after the last vaccination. There were significant differences between the two groups (P < 0.001) in the GMTs for antibodies against poliovirus types 1 and 2, but no significant difference was observed for antibodies against type 3 (P = 0.009). A non-inferiority t-test showed that the post-immunization GMTs for all three types in the Salk-Sabin-Sabin group were not inferior to those in the Salk-Salk-Salk group (P < 0.001). Safety assessment indicated that there was no significant difference in the incidence of all adverse events between the two groups (P = 0.806). Conclusions: The Salk-Sabin-Sabin IPV immunization schedule is not inferior to the Salk-Salk-Salk IPV schedule in terms of both immunogenicity and safety. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis media pathogens in infants receiving 10-valent non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10), 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) or a mixed primary schedule of both vaccines: A randomised controlled trial	VACCINE			English	Article						Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; PCV13; PHiD-CV10; Mixed primary schedule; Indigenous; Infant; Nasopharyngeal; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Non-typeable Haemophilus influenza; Carriage	COVERAGE ANNUAL-REPORT; HIGH-RISK POPULATION; STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE; IMMUNIZATION COVERAGE; BACTERIAL-COLONIZATION; NORTHERN-TERRITORY; CHILDREN; AUSTRALIA; RECOMMENDATIONS; 7-VALENT	Background: Aboriginal children in Northern Australia have a high burden of otitis media, driven by early and persistent nasopharyngeal carriage of otopathogens, including non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn). In this context, does a combined mixed primary series of Synflorix and Prevenar13 provide better protection against nasopharyngeal carriage of NTHi and Spn serotypes 3, 6A and 19A than either vaccine alone? Methods: Aboriginal infants (n = 425) were randomised to receive Synflorix(TM) (S, PHiD-CV10) or Prevenar13(TM) (P, PCV13) at 2, 4 and 6 months (_SSS or _PPP, respectively), or a 4-dose early mixed primary series of PHiDCV10 at 1, 2 and 4months and PCV13 at 6 months of age (SSSP). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 months of age. Swabs of ear discharge were collected from tympanic membrane perforations. Findings: At the primary endpoint at 7 months of age, the proportion of nasopharyngeal (Np) swabs positive for PCV13-only serotypes 3, 6A, or 19A was 0%, 0.8%, and 1.5% in the _PPP, _SSS, and SSSP groups respectively, and NTHi 55%, 52%, and 52% respectively, and no statistically significant vaccine group differences in other otopathogens at any age. The most common serotypes (in order) were 16F, 11A, 10A, 7B, 15A, 6C, 35B, 23B, 13, and 15B, accounting for 65% of carriage. Ear discharge swabs (n = 108) were culture positive for NTHi (52%), S. aureus (32%), and pneumococcus (20%). Conclusions: Aboriginal infants experience nasopharyngeal colonisation and tympanicmembrane perforations associated with NTHi, non-PCV13 pneumococcal serotypes and S. aureus in the first months of life. Nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcus or NTHi was not significantly reduced in the early 4-dose combined SSSP group compared to standard _PPP or _SSS schedules at any time point. Current pneumococcal conjugate vaccine formulations do not offer protection from early onset NTHi and pneumococcal colonisation in this high-risk population. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

J	Szigeti, R; Kellermayer, R				Szigeti, Reka; Kellermayer, Richard			Natural unblinding of BCG vaccination trials	VACCINE			English	Article						BCG; COVID-19; Clinical trial; Placebo; Blinding	RANDOMIZED CLINICAL-TRIALS; OBSERVER BIAS; OUTCOMES	There is significant public and clinical interest in the potential for Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination to protect against type 2 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) induced COVID-19. This question could be best answered by blinded and placebo controlled clinical trials. However, a skin reaction occurs within days at the site of BCG injection, making it rather challenging to blind this vaccination. Here, we examined registered clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov on BCG against COVID-19 by October 9th 2020, and found that 94.7% of such trials were listed as placebo controlled (all with normal saline as placebo), and single to quadruple blinded. The mode of overcoming the natural unblinding by the BCG induced skin reaction was not clarified on the website in either of the trials. We conclude that detailed description of the strategy towards overcoming the BCG vaccination induced skin reaction associated unblinding hurdle will be important for the interpretation of the theoretically blinded COVID-19 directed clinical trials.

Efficacy of recombinant Marek's disease virus vectored vaccines with computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) hemagglutinin insert against genetically diverse H5 high pathogenicity avian influenza viruses	VACCINE			English	Article						HPAIV; Avian influenza; HVT recombinant vector vaccine; COBRA; H5		The genetic and antigenic drift associated with the high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of Goose/Guangdong (Gs/ GD) lineage and the emergence of vaccine-resistant field viruses underscores the need for a broadly protective H5 influenza A vaccine. Here, we tested experimental vector herpesvirus of turkey (vHVT)-H5 vaccines containing either wild-type clade 2.3.4.4A-derived H5 inserts or computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) inserts with challenge by homologous and genetically divergent H5 HPAI Gs/GD lineage viruses in chickens. Direct assessment of protection was confirmed for all the tested constructs, which provided clinical protection against the homologous and heterologous H5 HPAI Gs/GD challenge viruses and significantly decreased oropharyngeal shedding titers compared to the sham vaccine. The cross reactivity was assessed by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and focus reduction assay against a panel of phylogenetically and antigenically diverse H5 strains. The COBRA-derived H5 inserts elicited antibody responses against antigenically diverse strains, while the wild-type-derived H5 vaccines elicited protection mostly against close antigenically related clades 2.3.4.4A and 2.3.4.4D viruses. In conclusion, the HVT vector, a widely used replicating vaccine platform in poultry, with H5 insert provides clinical protection and significant reduction of viral shedding against homologous and heterologous challenge. In addition, the COBRA-derived inserts have the potential to be used against antigenically distinct co-circulating viruses and future drift variants. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to investigate immunogenicity and safety of the third booster dose of the inactivated JE vaccine, as well as the long-term immunogenicity of the second booster dose in Korean children. Healthy children aged 11-13 years, primed and given four doses of inactivated JE vaccines were included. All subjects received the third booster dose of the JE vaccine. Neutralizing antibody (NTAb) titers were assessed before and 4-6 weeks after vaccination using plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), and were considered to be protective at >= 1:10. Local and systemic adverse events were monitored for 4 weeks after vaccination. Before and after booster vaccination, all seroprotection rates were 100%. Geometric mean titer (GMT) showed a 6.05-fold increase, from 139.11 (95% CI: 110.76, 174.71) to 841.53 (95% CI, 714.25, 991.50). The local tolerability and systemic safety profiles were favorable, with no serious adverse events. In conclusion, the third booster dose of the inactivated JE vaccine was demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic in Korean children when administered according to the current immunization schedule.

Economic evaluation of high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine in adults aged >= 65 years: A systematic literature review	VACCINE			English	Review						High-dose influenza vaccine; Health economics; Cost-effectiveness; Systematic review	PUBLIC-HEALTH IMPACT; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; ELDERLY POPULATION; UNITED-STATES; OLDER-ADULTS; EFFICACY; US; TRIVALENT; QUADRIVALENT; MODEL	Introduction: Due to waning immunity, adults aged >= 65 years are at increased risk of seasonal influenza infection and its complications. Adding to this risk, older adults have reduced responses to influenza vaccines. A high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose, Sanofi Pasteur) (IIV3-HD) was developed to improve protection against influenza in adults aged >= 65 years and has been licensed in the US since 2009 and in Canada since 2015. Post-licensure studies have shown that IIV3-HD is more effective than standard-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3-SD) at protecting against influenza infection in this population. Here, we performed a systematic review of economic analyses of IIV3HD in adults aged >= 65 years. Methods: On June 9, 2019, using the Ovid search platform, we searched Econlit, Embase, and Ovid MEDLINE (R) for original studies published in peer-reviewed journals examining the economics or cost-effectiveness of IIV3-HD in adults aged >= 65 years. Two reviewers independently selected studies and assessed their quality. Results: Seven studies were selected, all performed in the US or Canada. Five studies were funded by IIV3-HD manufacturer, and the remaining two by the US National Institute of General Medical Sciences. In all studies, IIV3-HDreduces healthcare resource utilization and is cost-effective or cost-saving compared to IIV3-SD. The main driver is reduced hospitalizations for cardiorespiratory events. Conclusion: IIV3-HD is cost-saving or cost-effective versus IIV3-SD in adults aged >= 65 years. Reduced cardiorespiratory complications are an important driver of these economic benefits.

Methods: We extracted records from two cohorts of patients aged 70-79 years in 2017 and 2018 respectively who were regular attenders in a nationwide general practice dataset, Medicinelnsight. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate VE. Models were adjusted for potential confounders including age, sex, and other covariates. Analyses were also stratified by sex, presence of comorbid conditions and number of general practitioner (GP) visits in the previous year. Results: The 2017 cohort included 40,275 regular attenders and the 2018 cohort 41,735. Both cohorts had a mean age of 73.9 years and 52% were women. In 2017, among vaccinated people, over 9,688 person-years of follow-up, 35 cases of zoster were diagnosed giving an incidence of 3.6 per 1000 person-years compared to 8.7 per 1000 person-years (264 cases/30,317 person-years) among unvaccinated people. For 2018, among vaccinated people there were 66 incident zoster cases over 16,716 person-years giving an incidence of 3.9 per 1000 person-years compared to 6.3 per 1000 person-years (156 cases/24,782 person-years) among the unvaccinated. Overall, in the first year of the program, when the average time since vaccination was about 8 months, VE was 63.5% (95% CI: 47.5, 74.6) but this fell to 48.2% (95% CI: 30.0, 61.7) in the second year when the average time since vaccination was about 18 months. We found no difference in VE across age, sex, presence of comorbid conditions, and prior GP visit frequency (P-interaction > 0.05). Conclusions: VE was consistent with that estimated in other countries and international settings. However, our findings suggest waning effectiveness after the first year of the program. Further program evaluation is necessary. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A phase IV clinical trial was conducted to perform an immunogenicity evaluation of lot-to-lot consistency of three commercial batches of sIPV in 1200 infants and to investigate the vaccine's safety on a large-scale in 20,019 infants for active monitoring and 29,683 infants for passive monitoring through the Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) reporting system in China. In the immunogenicity evaluation, the average seroconversion rates for type I, type II and type III of the three groups were 99.83%, 98.93% and 99.44%, respectively. No differences in the seroconversion rate and the GMT ratios were noted in the pair-to-pair comparisons. In the large-scale safety evaluation, most adverse reactions occurred 0-30 days after the first doses, and the common local and systemic reactions were similar to those in the phase III clinical trial, with low incidence in both activated and passive monitoring. In conclusion, sIPV exhibits good lot-to-lot consistency and safety in large-scale populations; thus, it is qualified to serve as one of the vaccines for use in eradicating all wild and vaccine-derived polioviruses worldwide in the near future.

However, vaccine innovation is costly and highly complex. To understand how vaccine manufacturers from developing countries approach innovation, a survey was conducted among company members of the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network, in collaboration with the Clinton Health Access Initiative. The survey confirmed that vaccine manufacturers from developing countries are committed to vaccine innovation: 95% of respondents have interest in pursuing vaccine innovation, with strategies targeted towards supplying to low- and middle-income countries. Key barriers to innovation were also surveyed, with respondents highlighting challenges regarding access to in-licensing or joint venture partnerships, financing, and regulatory barriers. Opportunities for innovation are also discussed. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Small animal jet injection technique results in enhanced immunogenicity of hantavirus DNA vaccines	VACCINE			English	Article						DNA vaccine; Jet injection; Tropis; Immunogenicity; Hamster, hantavirus		DNA vaccine evaluation in small animals is hampered by low immunogenicity when the vaccines are delivered using a needle and syringe. To overcome this technical hurdle we tested the possibility that a device developed for human intradermal medicine delivery might be adapted to successfully deliver a DNA vaccine to small animals. Disposable syringe jet injection (DSJI) does not currently exist for small animals. However, a commercialized, human intradermal device used to to administer medicines to the human dermis in a 0.1 mL volume was evaluated in Syrian hamsters. Here, we found that hantavirus DNA vaccines administered to hamsters using DSJI were substantially more immunogenic than the same vaccines delivered by needle/syringe or particle mediated epidermal delivery (gene gun) vaccination. By adjusting how the device was used we could deliver vaccine to either subcutaneous tissues, or through the skin into the muscle. RNA and/or antigen expression was detected in epidermal, subepidermal and fibroblast cells. We directly compared six optimized and non-optimized hantavirus DNA vaccines in hamsters. Optimization, including codon-usage and mRNA stability, did not necessarily result in increased immunogenicity for all vaccines tested; however, optimization of the Andes virus (ANDV) DNA vaccine protected vaccinated hamsters from lethal disease. This is the first time active vaccination with an ANDV DNA vaccine has shown protective efficacy in the hamster model. The adaptation of a human intradermal jet injection device for use as a method of subcutaneous and intramuscular jet injection of DNA vaccines will advance the development of nucleic acid based medical countermeasures for diseases modeled in hamsters.

To develop subunit vaccines for ZIKV, we have previously constructed recombinant ZIKV envelope protein domain III (EDIII), and the entire ectodomain (E80, which comprises EDI, EDIT and EDIII), as vaccine candidates and showed both of them being immunogenic and protective in murine models. In this follow-up study, we compared these vaccine candidates in non-human primates. Both of them elicited neutralizing antibody responses, but only E80 immunization inhibited ZIKV infection in both peripheral blood and monkey tissues, whereas EDIII increased blood ZIKV RNA through possibly antibody-dependent enhancement. Further investigations revealed that the virion-binding antibody response in E80 immunized monkeys persisted longer and stronger than in EDIII immunized monkeys. These results demonstrate that E80 is superior to EDIII as a vaccine candidate, and that the magnitude, quality and durability of virion-binding neutralizing antibodies are correlates of protection.

Optimization of RG1-VLP vaccine performance in mice with novel TLR4 agonists	VACCINE			English	Article						Human papillomavirus; HPV; Prophylactic vaccine; TLR4; Adjuvants; HPV-L2; Neutralizing antibody	VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES; PROTEIN	Current human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines provide substantial protection against the most common HPV types responsible for oral and anogenital cancers, but many circulating cancer-causing types remain that lack vaccine coverage. The novel RG1-VLP (virus-like particle) vaccine candidate utilizes the HPV16-L1 subunit as a backbone to display an inserted HPV16-L2 17-36 a.a. "RG1" epitope; the L2 RG1 epitope is conserved across many HPV types and the generation of cross-neutralizing antibodies (Abs) against which has been demonstrated. In an effort to heighten the immunogenicity of the RG1-VLP vaccine, we compared in BALB/c mice adjuvant formulations consisting of novel bacterial enzymatic combinatorial chemistry (BECC)-derived toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonists and the aluminum hydroxide adjuvant Alhydrogel. In the presence of BECC molecules, consistent improvements in the magnitude of Ab responses to both HPV16-L1 and the L2 RG1 epitope were observed compared to Alhydrogel alone. Furthermore, neutralizing titers to HPV16 as well as cross-neutralization of pseudovirion (PsV) types HPV18 and HPV39 were augmented in the presence of BECC agonists as well. Levels of L1 and L2-specific Abs were achieved after two vaccinations with BECC/Alhydrogel adjuvant that were equivalent to or greater than levels achieved with 3 vaccinations with Alhydrogel alone, indicating that the presence of BECC molecules resulted in accelerated immune responses that could allow for a decreased dose schedule for VLP-based HPV vaccines. In addition, dose-sparing studies indicated that adjuvantation with BECC/Alhydrogel allowed for a 75% reduction in antigen dose while still retaining equivalent magnitudes of responses to the full VLP dose with Alhydrogel. These data suggest that adjuvant optimization of HPV VLP-based vaccines can lead to rapid immunity requiring fewer boosts, dose-sparing of VLPs expensive to produce, and the establishment of a longer-lasting humoral immunity.

Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of maternal pertussis immunization in low- and middle-income countries: A review of lessons learnt	VACCINE			English	Review						Cost-effectiveness; Maternal immunization; Pertussis; Dynamic transmission model; Infant vaccination; Vaccine policy	BILL	This issue of Vaccine is devoted to papers from a research project that developed two types of simulation models, static and dynamic transmission, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of maternal immunization to prevent pertussis in infants in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The research was conducted by a multinational team of investigators and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to gain an understanding of when and where maternal immunization might be a good public health investment for LMICs. Here we review the project's central lessons for vaccine policy and research. Models require a lot of data. As most LMICs lack good data, the models were built using pertussis disease burden data from Brazil, a middle-income country with three long-established, independent information systems (disease surveillance, hospitalization, and mortality), on the hypothesis that the disease process is similar across countries. Values for key parameters, particularly infant mortality, infant vaccine coverage, and costs of vaccination and treatment, were then varied to represent other LMICs. The results show that coverage levels of infant whole cell pertussis (wP) vaccine are key to the cost-effectiveness of maternal pertussis immunization. In settings where infant wP coverage is below the threshold thought necessary to eliminate pertussis in the population, 90-95%, maternal immunization is cost-effective, even cost-saving. By contrast, it is very expensive in countries capable of maintaining infant vaccination in or above the threshold range. The research also suggests that, while static models may serve to explore an intervention's cost-effectiveness initially, dynamic transmission models are essential for more accurate estimates. These findings can help guide policies toward maternal pertussis immunization, but also show that developing better data on neonatal pertussis mortality burden and infant vaccine coverage in LMICs, and on the duration of immunity of currently available pertussis vaccines, are key priorities to support better vaccine policy.

Cholesteryl pullulan (CHP) that forms nano-sized hydrogel (nanogel) and encapsulates proteins was shown to be useful in the delivery of vaccines. Here we demonstrate that subcutaneous immunization of mice with bovine serum albumin (BSA) chemically conjugated to NH2-CHP nanogel induces strong antibody production. This augmented antibody production requires covalent conjugation between BSA and CHP, but does not require nanogel formation. Conjugation of NH2-CHP nanogel induces persistence of BSA in dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo. As resistance to lysosomal degradation was previously shown to augment antigen presentation by DCs, conjugation of antigens with CHP nanogel may enhance antibody production to antigens by delaying lysosomal degradation. Therefore, delayed degradation of antigens by covalent conjugation with nanoparticles may be a good strategy for the development of effective vaccines. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We estimated the burden of IPD in Ontario and British Columbia (BC) by combining surveillance data with health administrative databases. Methods: We established a cohort of 27,525 individuals in Ontario and BC. Laboratory-confirmed IPD cases were identified from Ontario's integrated Public Health Information System and the BC Centre for Disease Control Public Health Laboratory. Possible IPD cases were identified from hospitalization data in both provinces, and from emergency department visit data in Ontario. We estimated the age and sex adjusted annual incidence of IPD and pneumococcal conjugate/polysaccharide vaccine (PCV/PPV) serotype-specific IPD using Poisson regression models. Results: In Ontario, 20,205 overall IPD cases, including 15,299 laboratory-confirmed cases, were identified with relatively stable age-and sex-adjusted annual incidence rates ranging from 13.7/100,000 (2005) to 13.6/100,000 (2018). In BC, 7,320 overall IPD cases, including 5,932 laboratory-confirmed cases were identified; annual incidence rates increased from 10.9/100,000 (2002) to 13.2/100,000 (2018). Older adults aged > 85 years had the highest incidence rates. During 2007-2018 the incidence of PCV7 serotypes and additional PCV13 serotypes decreased while the incidence of unique PPV23 and non vaccine serotypes increased in both provinces. Conclusions: IPD continues to cause a substantial public health burden in Canada despite publicly funded pneumococcal vaccination programs, resulting in part from an increase in unique PPV23 and non-vaccine serotypes.

We conducted a retrospective case series of ITP following vaccination with Vaxzevria ChadOx1-S (AstraZeneca) and mRNA Comirnaty BNT162b2 COVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccines and compare the incidence to expected background rates for Victoria during the first six months of the Australian COVID-19 vaccination roll-out in 2021. Cases were identified by reports to the Victorian state vaccine safety service, SAEFVIC, of individuals aged 18 years or older presenting with thrombocytopenia following COVID-19 vaccination without evidence of thrombosis. Twenty-one confirmed or probable cases of ITP were identified following receipt of AstraZeneca (n = 17) or Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 4) vaccines. This translates to an observed incidence of 8 per million doses for AstraZeneca vaccine, twice the expected background rate of 4.1 per million. The observed rate for Pfizer-BioNTech was consistent with the expected background rate. The median time to onset for the cases post AstraZeneca vaccination was 10 days (range 1-78) and median platelet nadir 5 x 10(9)/L (range 0-67 x 10(9)/L). Hospital presentations or admissions for management of symptoms such as bleeding occurred in 18 (86%) of the cases. The majority of cases (n = 11) required intervention with at least 2 therapy modalities. In conclusion, we observed a substantially higher than expected rate of ITP following AstraZeneca vaccination. ITP is the second haematological adverse event, distinct from that of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), observed following AstraZeneca vaccination. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: We conducted a 5-month longitudinal prospective study involving vaccinated healthcare per-sonnel, who were tested monthly for antibody titer, and sampled biweekly and on clinical indication for SARS-COV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to determine antibody decline and breakthrough infection. Results: 100 participants were recruited to the study. Antibody titer reached the climate after one month of the second dose of the vaccine, and declined rapidly thereafter: the median antibody levels were 895; 22,266; 9,682; 2,554 and 1,401 AU/ml in the day of the second dose, and in one month interval thereafter, respectively. In other words, four months after vaccination, the mean antibody level was 6% of the peak levels. During the study period, 4 breakthrough infections were diagnosed, 2 of which were asymp-tomatic, and the remaining two were mild cases; sharp elevation of antibody titer was seen after infec-tion. Conclusion: Antibody titer drops rapidly one month after the second dose of the vaccine. All infections within the study period were mild or asymptomatic, after which titer elevations were seen.

GIS technology has been applied to track polio vaccination activities in Nigeria with encouraging outcomes. Despite numerous measles vaccination campaigns after the first catch up campaign in 2005, sub-optimal outcomes of previous measles supplemental immunization activities necessitated the use of innovative ideas to achieve better outcomes especially when planning for the 2017/2018 measles vaccination campaign. This led to the application of the use of the GIS technology for the Northern states in 2017/2018 campaign. This study is a report of what was achieved with the use of the GIS in the 2017/2018 measles vaccination campaign in Nigeria. Methods: GIS generated ward maps were used for the microplanning processes for the 2017/2018 measles vaccination campaign. These ward maps had estimates of the target population by settlements, the number and location of vaccination posts ensuring that a vaccination post is sited within one-kilometer radius of a settlement, and the number of teams needed to support the vaccination campaign as well as the catchment area and daily implementation plans. The ward microplans were verified by checking for accuracy and consistency of the target population, settlements, number of teams, vaccination posts and daily implementation work plans using a standard checklist. The ward maps were deployed into use for the measles vaccination campaign after the state team driven validation and verification by the National team (Government and Partners) Results: The Northern states that applied the GIS technology had a closer operational target population to that on the verified microplan than those of the non-GIS technology states. Greater than 90% of the ward maps had all that is expected in the maps - i.e settlements, target populations, and vaccination posts captured, except Kaduna, Katsina and Adamawa states. Of all enumeration areas sampled during the post-campaign survey in states with GIS ward maps, none had a zero-vaccination coverage of the surveyed children, with the exception of one in Borno state that had security issues. In the post campaign coverage survey, the percentage of responses that gave vaccination post being too far as a reason for non-vaccination of children in the Northern zones that used GIS generated ward maps was less than half the rate seen in the southern zones where the GIS microplanning was not used. Conclusion: The use of GIS-generated wards maps improved the quality of ward micro plans and optimized the placement of vaccination posts, resulting in a significant reduction in zero-dose clusters found during the post campaign coverage survey.

Angiopoietin-like proteins 3 (ANGPTL3) and 4 (ANGPTL4) are critical regulators of TG metabolism that function by inhibiting the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is responsible for hydrolyzing triglycerides in lipoproteins into free fatty acids. Interestingly, individuals with loss-of-function mutations in ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 have low plasma TG levels, have a reduced risk of CHD, and are otherwise healthy. Consequently, interventions targeting ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 have emerged as promising new approaches for reducing elevated TGs. Here, we developed virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccines that target the LPL binding domains of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4. ANGPTL3 VLPs and ANGPTL4 VLPs are highly immunogenic in mice and vaccination with ANGPTL3 VLPs, but not ANGPTL4 VLPs, was associated with reduced steady state levels of TGs. Immunization with ANGPTL3 VLPs rapidly cleared circulating TG levels following an oil gavage challenge and enhanced plasma LPL activity. These data indicate that targeting ANGPTL3 by active vaccination is a potential alternative to other ANGPTL3-inhibiting therapies. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Borghi, L; Riva, E				Borghi, Luca; Riva, Elisabetta			Was Aldo Castellani the inventor of combined and polyvalent vaccines?	VACCINE			English	Article						Combined vaccine; Polyvalent vaccine; History; First World War; Military medicine; Aldo Castellani	VACCINATION; INOCULATION; ORIGIN	Italian born and long term resident in England, Sir Aldo Castellani (1874-1971), is usually credited with "several discoveries of great importance in tropical medicine", most notably for his role in determining the aetiology of sleeping sickness and yaws. This contribution tries to highlight his role in the history of vaccinology as a pioneer in the design and use of combined and polyvalent vaccines. In the light of existing data, while acting as Director of the Bacteriological Institute of Colombo (Ceylon) in the decade before the First World War, Castellani was the first to experiment with both different strains of "antigens belonging to the same group" like in his typhoid-paratyphoid vaccine (TAB), as well as the simultaneous use of more pathogens, or part of them, for protection against different diseases, like in his "tetravaccine" (TAB + cholera) and "pentavaccine" (TAB + cholera + Malta fever). At the beginning of the War, based on the results of thousands of vaccinations, he strongly maintained that those combined or mixed vaccines were harmless and effective. The Allied Armies became more and more interested in Castellani's meth-ods. His TAB vaccine was extensively used among the soldiers and his contributions were largely acknowledged especially in the Anglo-Saxon world in the following years, when it was plainly stated that "to Castellani is due the credit of having first proposed, prepared, and used, combined vaccines". The path to widespread use of combination and polyvalent vaccines -which is usually dated back only to the late 1940s -was still long and winding. Castellani himself abandoned that field of research after the War and this is probably why that early history is nowadays often forgotten. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SHINE Trial Team	The fecal microbiome and rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity in rural Zimbabwean infants	VACCINE			English	Article						Microbiota; Microbiome; Rotavirus; Shotgun metagenomics; Oral rotavirus vaccine	GUT MICROBIOME; IMPROVED WATER; EFFICACY; SAFETY; SANITATION; INFECTION; CHILDREN; HYGIENE; TRIAL	Background: Oral rotavirus vaccine (RVV) immunogenicity is considerably lower in low-versus high-income populations; however, the mechanisms underlying this remain unclear. Previous evidence sug-gests that the gut microbiota may contribute to differences in oral vaccine efficacy. Methods: We performed whole metagenome shotgun sequencing on stool samples and measured anti-rotavirus immunoglobulin A in plasma samples from a subset of infants enrolled in a cluster randomized 2 x 2 factorial trial of improved water, sanitation and hygiene and infant feeding in rural Zimbabwe (SHINE trial: NCT01824940). We examined taxonomic microbiome composition and functional metagen-ome features using random forest models, differential abundance testing and regression analyses to explored associations with RVV immunogenicity. Results: Among 158 infants with stool samples and anti-rotavirus IgA titres, 34 were RVV seroconverters. The median age at stool collection was 43 days (IQR: 35-68), corresponding to a median of 4 days before the first RVV dose. The infant microbiome was dominated by Bifidobacterium longum. The gut microbiome differed significantly between early (<42 days) and later samples (>42 days) however, we observed no meaningful differences in alpha diversity, beta diversity, species composition or functional metagenomic features by RVV seroconversion status. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was the only species associated with anti-rotavirus IgA titre. Random forest models poorly classified seroconversion status by both composi-tion and functional microbiome variables. Conclusions: RVV immunogenicity is low in this rural Zimbabwean setting, however it was not associated with the composition or function of the early-life gut microbiome in this study. Further research is war-ranted to examine the mechanisms of poor oral RVV efficacy in low-income countries. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Influenza Viruses Acutely Ill IVY	Influenza vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among adults hospitalized with severe acute respiratory illnesses, United States 20192020	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccination; Vaccine hesitancy; Vaccine acceptance; Influenza; Medical insurance		Introduction: Understanding patient factors associated with not being vaccinated is essential for successful implementation of influenza vaccination programs. Methods: We enrolled adults hospitalized with severe acute respiratory illness at 10 United States (US) hospitals during the 20192020 influenza season. We interviewed patients to collect data about influenza vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics, and vaccine perceptions. Results: Among 679 participants, 264 (38.9%) reported not receiving influenza vaccination. Among those not vaccinated, 135 (51.1%) reported choosing not to receive a vaccine because of perceived ineffectiveness (36.7%) or risk (14.4%) of influenza vaccination. Sociodemographic factors associated with not being vaccinated included no medical insurance (aOR=6.42; 95% CI: 2.5216.38) and being non-White or Hispanic (aOR=1.54, 95% CI: 1.022.32). Conclusions: Optimizing uptake of influenza vaccination in the US may be improved by educational programs regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness and enhancing vaccine access, particularly among nonWhite and Hispanic Americans and those without medical insurance.

We conducted a risk-benefit analysis for Australians aged 18-59 years, comparing the risk of vaccination versus infection, and rate of TTS to other vaccines which prompted policy change following rare adverse events - rotavirus, smallpox and oral polio vaccines. COVID-19 deaths over 12 months range from 0 to 417 in current and future worst case scenarios. In the past 15 months 20 COVID-19 deaths occurred in people < 60 years compared to 890 deaths over 60 years. The estimated possible number of TTS cases is 347, with vaccine-related deaths ranging from 17 to 153 if 80% of adults 18-59 years are vaccinated. The reported rate of TTS is in the same range as rare but serious adverse events associated with other vaccines that have been subject to policy change. In Australia, the potential risks of the AZD1222 vaccine in younger adults, who are at low risk of dying from COVID-19, may outweigh the benefits. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kessels, R; Luyten, J; Tubeuf, S				Kessels, Roselinde; Luyten, Jeroen; Tubeuf, Sandy			Willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and attitudes toward vaccination in general	VACCINE			English	Article						Belgium; Covid-19; Hesitancy; Immunisation; Vaccination		Background: High uptake of Covid-19 vaccination is required to reach herd immunity. Methods: A representative sample of 2,060 Belgians were surveyed in October 2020. Regression analyses identified the predictors associated with willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19, and attitudes toward vaccination in general. Results: 34% of the participants reported that they will definitely get vaccinated against Covid-19 and 39% that they would "probably". Intended uptake was strongly associated with age, opinion on the government's dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, medical risk, spoken language, gender, and to a lesser extent with having known someone who was hospitalised because of Covid-19. Similar predictors were identified for attitudes to vaccination in general. Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy was more marked in age groups below 54 years old. We further analysed a sample of 17% (N = 349) found favourable to vaccination in general but not willing to be vaccinated against Covid-19. They were mainly female, young, French speaking, slightly less educated, working, and did not belong to a Covid-19 risk group. They were very dissatisfied with the government's dealing with the pandemic, and did not know someone who was hospitalised because of Covid-19. Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy was higher for Covid-19 vaccines than for other vaccines. The part of the population being convinced of the utility of vaccination in general but hesitant about the Covid-19 vaccine is a primary interest group for tailored communication campaigns in order to reach the vaccine coverage needed for herd immunity.

"From my phone, I could rule the world": Critical engagement with maternal vaccine information, vaccine confidence builders and post-Zika outbreak rumours in Brazil	VACCINE			English	Article						Maternal immunization; Vaccine confidence; Rumours; Post-outbreak; Microcephaly; Zika; Maternal Health; Qualitative Research	DECISION-MAKING; VIRUS; IMMUNIZATION; HEALTH	Maternal immunization is key to protecting maternal and newborn health. We interviewed pregnant women in Brazil to identify barriers to and enablers of maternal immunization in the country. Indepth interviews and focus groups were conducted in Brazil with 60 pregnant women from Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro at different stages of their pregnancies. Participants were encouraged to discuss views on safety, efficacy and importance of maternal vaccines, access to vaccines, interactions with healthcare professionals, and sources of information on vaccine-related matters. There was generally a positive regard for maternal immunization among the interviewed women, many of whom associated vaccination with protection of their unborn child. The interviewees cited several reasons for adherence to immunization guidelines, including recommendations from healthcare professionals, targeted communication campaigns, and active use of a vaccination card or booklet. There were no reported barriers for maternal vaccines. Some women using private healthcare services reported not having been asked about vaccines at check-ups, which could adversely affect vaccination rates. A rumour that vaccines caused microcephaly which emerged during the Zika outbreak was the most commonly cited reason for choosing not to vaccinate among the interviewees. This study identified important vaccine confidence builders. Many of the interviewees critically reflected upon information received, placing themselves as the decision makers over their health choices. A prominent barrier to maternal immunization was a rumour linking vaccines to microcephaly. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been previously reported in the literature and requires further investigation into the extent of this issue and how it can be mitigated.

We assessed the direct effectiveness of PCV13 against community acquired pneumonia (CAP) associated with PCV13 serotype carriage (VT-CAP). Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study of children born during 12-Dec-2016 to 30-Nov 2018 identified in the Suzhou Centers for Disease Control vaccine registry database, and who had at least one inpatient or outpatient record at the Suzhou University Affiliated Children's hospital (SCH) health information-system (HIS) database. The vaccine registry cohort was followed through the HIS database through 30-Jun-2019 to identify hospitalized VT-CAP. Pneumococci were isolated from deep upper respiratory aspirates and serotyped with Quellung reactions. Results: We included 139,127 children of whom 9024 (6.5%) received 1 + PCV13 doses (95.8% received 2 + doses). Within the total cohort, we identified 548 children hospitalized at SCH for VT-CAP, of whom 10 had received 2 + PCV13 doses. Adjusted for demographics, receipt of other childhood vaccines, and underlying medical conditions, the first visit vaccine effectiveness among children who had received 2 + PCV13 doses was 60.9% (95% CI: 25.8% to 79.4%) for VT-CAP and 17.9% (95% CI: 5.5% to 28.6%) for clinical CAP. Incidence rate reductions per 100,000 child-years of observation for all visits were 208 (95% CI: 118 to 298) for VT-CAP and 720 (95% CI: 304 to 1135) for clinical CAP. Conclusions: PCV13 was protective against hospitalized VT-CAP and clinical CAP with large associated incidence rate reductions among children living in Suzhou, China. (c) 2021 The Authors.

The potency and stability of the candidate standards were determined by neutralization assay and accelerated degradation study. The stability studies showed that the standards were stable in the short-term. The collaborative study showed that the candidate standards could reduce the variations in neutralization titers between labs and thus improve comparability of neutralizing antibody measurements. Sample 22 has been approved by the Biological Product Reference Standards Sub-Committee of the National Drug Reference Standards Committee as the first Chinese National Standard for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing antibody, with an assigned potency of 1,000 units per milliliter (U/ml).

These illnesses are preventable via vaccination, but uptake is low and decreasing. Little research has focused on understanding the psychosocial reasons behind older adults' hesitancy towards different vaccines. A cross-sectional survey with 372 UK-based adults aged 65-92 years (M = 70.5) assessed awareness and uptake of the influenza, pneumococcal, and shingles vaccines. Participants provided health and sociodemographic data and completed two scales measuring the psychosocial factors associated with vaccination behaviour. Self-reported daily functioning, cognitive difficulties, and social support were also assessed. Participants were additionally given the opportunity to provide free text responses outlining up to three main reasons for their vaccination decisions. We found that considerably more participants had received the influenza vaccine in the last 12 months (83.6%), relative to having ever received the pneumococcal (60.2%) and shingles vaccines (58.9%). Participants were more aware of their eligibility for the influenza vaccine, and were more likely to have been offered it. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that a lower sense of collective responsibility independently predicted lack of uptake of all three vaccines. Greater calculation of disease and vaccination risk, and preference for natural immunity, also predicted not getting the influenza vaccine. For both the pneumococcal and shingles vaccines, concerns about profiteering further predicted lack of uptake. Analysis of the qualitative responses highlighted that participants vaccinated to protect their own health and that of others. Our findings suggest that interventions targeted towards older adults would benefit from being vaccine-specific and that they should emphasise disease risks and vaccine benefits for the individual, as well as the benefits of vaccination for the wider community. These findings can help inform intervention development aimed at increasing vaccination uptake in future. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We previously developed an adjuvant-free cationic nanogel nasal vaccine containing pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), which is expressed on the surfaces of all pneumococ-cal serotypes. Here, to address the sequence diversity of PspA proteins, we formulated a cationic nanogel-based trivalent pneumococcal nasal vaccine and demonstrated the vaccine's immunogenicity and protec-tive efficacy in macaques by using a newly developed nasal spray device applicable to humans. Nasal vac-cination of macaques with cationic cholesteryl pullulan nanogel (cCHP)-trivalent PspA vaccine effectively induced PspA-specific IgGs that bound to pneumococcal surfaces and triggered complement C3 deposi-tion. The immunized macaques were protected from pneumococcal intratracheal challenge through both inhibition of lung inflammation and a dramatic reduction in the numbers of bacteria in the lungs. These results demonstrated that the cCHP-trivalent PspA vaccine is an effective candidate vaccine against pneu-mococcal infections. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This is of concern since perinatally-infected infants are at highest risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, a life-threatening consequence of chronic HBV infection. While tools to prevent HBV MTCT are available, the cost implications of these interventions need consideration prior to implementation. A Markov model was developed to determine the costs and health outcomes of (1) universal HBV birth dose (BD) vaccination, (2) universal BD vaccination and targeted hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG), (3) maternal antiviral prophylaxis using sequential HBV viral load testing added to HBV BD vaccination and HBIG, and (4) maternal antiviral prophylaxis using sequential HBeAg testing combined with HBV BD vaccination and HBIG. Health outcomes were assessed as the number of paediatric infections averted and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Primary cost data included consumables, human resources, and hospital facilities. HBV epidemiology, transitions probabilities, disability weights, and the risks of HBV MTCT were extracted from the literature. Incremental costeffectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to compare successive more expensive interventions to the previous less expensive one. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model's outputs. At the Namibian cost/DALY averted threshold of US$3 142, the (1) BD vaccination + targeted HBIG, and (2) maternal antiviral prophylaxis with sequential HBeAg testing interventions were cost-effective. These interventions had ICERs equal to US$1909.03/DALY and US$2598.90/ DALY averted, respectively. In terms of effectiveness, the maternal antiviral prophylaxis with sequential HBeAg testing intervention was the intervention of choice. The analysis showed that elimination of HBV MTCT is achievable using maternal antiviral prophylaxis with active and passive immunization. There is an urgent need for low cost diagnostic tests to identify those women who will most benefit from drug therapy to attain this laudable goal. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although the persistence of circulating neutralizing antibodies among the vaccinated is unclear, it is estimated that > 99% of the population vaccinated according to the recommended protocol should be protected for at least 18 years. Methods: This study evaluated the seroprevalence of anti-PV neutralizing antibodies and the long-term immunogenicity of the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in a sample of medical students and residents of the University of Bari who attended the Hygiene Department for a biological risk assessment between April 2014 and October 2020. Results: The prevalence of protected vaccinated individuals was > 90% for PV1, PV2, and PV3. Specifically, >99% of the study group was protected against PV1, > 98% against PV2, and almost 93% against PV3. Protective antibodies against all three viruses persisted for at least up to 18 years after administration of the last OPV dose, with PV1 and PV2 antibodies detected in > 95% of the participants > 30 years after the last OPV dose. Conclusions: The childhood series of four doses of OPV guarantees a long duration of protection, despite the elimination of the virus and therefore the absence of a natural booster. However, until PV1 is completely eradicated, maximum vigilance on the part of public health institutions must be maintained. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The case definition was developed by topic experts convened by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in the context of active development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. The format of the Brighton Collaboration was followed, including an exhaustive review of the literature, to develop a consensus definition and defined levels of certainty. The document underwent peer review by the Brighton Collaboration Network and by selected expert external reviewers prior to submission. The comments of the reviewers were taken into consideration and edits incorporated into this final manuscript. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The optimal pneumococcal vaccination strategy for SOT patients is not known. Methods: The potential adult liver transplant recipients were randomised into two arms: to receive a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) before the transplantation or to receive a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) before the transplantation and a second dose of PCV13 six months after the transplantation. Serotype-specific antibody concentrations and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) were measured before and after the first vaccination (visits V1,V2) and six and seven months after the transplantation, e.g. before and after the second PCV13 (visits V3,V4). Results: Out of 47 patients, 19 (PCV13 arm) and 17 (PPV23 arm) received a liver transplant and all these patients completed the study (36/47, 76,6%). Each vaccine schedule elicited a good immune response. At V2, the geometric mean concentrations (GMC's) of antibodies for serotypes 6A, 7F and 23F, and the geometric mean titers (GMT ' s) of OPA for serotypes 4, 6A, 6B and 23F were significantly higher for PCV13, but the proportions of patients reaching OPA cut-off >= 8 or ELISA cut-off >= 1.0 mu g/ml did not differ between the arms. At V3 the antibody concentrations and the OPA had declined to baseline in both arms. The second PCV13 vaccination elicited an immune response. There was no difference in adverse events. No vaccine-related allograft rejection was detected. Conclusions: The immunogenicity of PPV23 and PCV13 was comparable in this patient material, but the seroresponses waned after transplantation. The second dose of PCV13 restored the immune responses and was well tolerated. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Systematic literature review of neutralizing antibody immune responses to non-vaccine targeted high-risk HPV types induced by the bivalent and the quadrivalent vaccines	VACCINE			English	Review						Cross-protection; HPV; HPV vaccine; Human papillomavirus; Immune response; Antibody response	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINES; CROSS-PROTECTIVE EFFICACY; IMMUNOGENICITY; 9-VALENT; POPULATION; INFECTION; SAFETY; PROGRAMS; IMPACT; IGG	Introduction: Studies on the cross-protective effect of HPV bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines demonstrated inconsistent findings against additional HPV types covered by the nonavalent vaccine. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review to assess the consistency and durability of the cross-protective neutralizing antibody immune responses of the currently licensed bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines to non-vaccine HPV types targeted by the nonavalent vaccine (HPV 6, 11, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58). Methods: PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched from 2008 to 2019 to identify studies reporting antibody/immune response after vaccination with either the bivalent, quadrivalent, or nonavalent vaccine. Key outcomes were seroconversion, seropositivity or geometric mean titers against HPV types 6, 11, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Results: Eighteen publications met inclusion criteria, reporting on 14 interventional and five observational studies. Across all studies, immune responses to non-vaccine high-risk HPV types after bivalent vaccination were higher than baseline or quadrivalent vaccine. Nonavalent vaccine elicited near total seroconversion to HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, with seropositivity remaining near 100% up to 24 months post-dose 1. In contrast, bivalent and quadrivalent vaccination resulted in lower seroconversion levels for non-vaccine types, which waned over time. Conclusions: The cross-protection antibody/immune response among participants having received all three doses of bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine is not comparable to the specific response elicited by HPV vaccine types. Even in cases where a statistically significant cross-reactive immunological response is reported, long-term data on the duration of the response beyond two years are very limited. Further, the lack of a standard for assays limits comparability of results between studies. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, neonatal and adult pigs were vaccinated in the skin using dissolving microneedle patches to investigate the immuno-stimulatory potential of different TLRa and possible age-dependent differences early after vaccination. These patches contained TLR1/2a (Pam3Cys), TLR7/8a (R848) or TLR9a (CpG ODN) combined with inactivated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) or with an oil-in-water stable emulsion. Vaccinated skin and draining lymph nodes were analysed for immune response genes using microfluidic high-throughput qPCR to evaluate the early immune response and activation of APCs. Skin pathology and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the local immune responses and APCs in the vaccinated skin, respectively. In both neonatal and adult pigs, skin vaccination with TLR7/8a induced the most prominent early inflammatory and immune cell responses, particularly in the skin. Skin histopathology and immunohistochemistry of APCs showed comparable results for neonatal and adult pigs after vaccination with the different TLRa vaccines. However, in vaccinated neonatal pigs in the skin and draining lymph node more immune response related genes were upregulated compared to adult pigs. We showed that both neonatal and adult skin could be stimulated to develop an immune response, particularly after TLR7/8a vaccination, with age-dependent differences in regulation of immune genes. Therefore, age-dependent differences in local early immune responses should be considered when developing skin vaccines. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Aldakak, L; Huber, VM; Ruhli, F; Bender, N				Aldakak, Lafi; Huber, Vera Maria; Ruhli, Frank; Bender, Nicole			Sex difference in the immunogenicity of the quadrivalent Human Papilloma Virus vaccine: Systematic review and meta-analysis	VACCINE			English	Review						Quadrivalent HPV vaccine; Sex difference; Human Papilloma Virus; Antibody response; Cervical cancer; Immunogenicity		Background: Immunological differences between males and females in response to viral vaccines are well known. This the first review to examine them for the Human Papilloma Virus. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the immunogenicity of the Quadrivalent Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine qHPVV. We searched Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL for trials published until September 17, 2019. Inclusion criteria were 3-doses and reporting geometric mean titers (GMTs). We performed random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression separated by age group and sex. Results: Our search yielded 1809 unique studies. 334 full texts were screened and data from 18 studies were extracted. Females had higher pooled geometric mean titers than males in all age groups. Log transformed GMTs in male children (<16) years were: against HPV6: 6.62 (95% CI 6.29-6.94; I-2 = 86.0%), against HPV11: 7.07 (95% CI 6.90-7.23; I-2 = 63.1%), against HPV16: 8.53 (95% CI 8.28-8.78; I-2 = 73.0%), and against HPV18 7.21 (95% CI 7.08-7.34; I-2 = 26.4%). In females: against HPV6 7.10 (95% CI 6.79-7.41; I-2 = 96.6%), HPV11: 7.32 (95% CI 7.15-7. 50; I-2 = 90.6%), HPV16: 8.71 (95% CI 8.52-8.91; I-2 = 90.2%), and HPV18 7.35 (95% CI 7.11-7.58; I-2 = 92.7%). In the meta-regression, the sexual difference was significant for HPV6 (p = 0.022) with a similar tendency for HPV11 (p = 0.066) and HPV18 (p = 0.079). Immunogenicity was significantly higher in children (<16) than in adults (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Females have higher antibody titers against HPV after receiving the qHPVV than do males. The difference is bigger in low-risk HPV strains. Adjusting the doses and schedules for each sex should be explored further. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A comparison of multivalent and bivalent vaccination strategies for the control of virulent ovine footrot	VACCINE			English	Article						Footrot; Dichelobacter nodosus; Vaccine; Fimbrial; Multivalent; Bivalent		Virulent footrot is a significant economic and animal welfare concern. The disease can be treated, controlled, and eliminated with vaccine, but selecting the appropriate vaccination strategy can be challenging. There are two main strategies: outbreak (serogroup)-specific univalent or bivalent vaccination, or use of a multivalent vaccine containing up to nine of the most common serogroups. The objective of this study was to compare these approaches in sheep flocks infected with multiple Dichelobacter nodosus serogroups. In the first phase, we undertook an immunogenicity trial in which we compared four precommercial multivalent recombinant fimbrial vaccines containing six (A, B, C, G, H, I) or nine (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I) serogroups, and compared them to commercial bivalent vaccines. Two multivalent vaccines stimulated significantly higher antibody responses than two other multivalent vaccines but the number of serogroups included in the multivalent vaccine formulations did not have a significant effect. In the first phase, we also compared inter-vaccination intervals of two- and three-months between sequential bivalent vaccines, and found that a two-month interval was sufficient to avoid antigenic competition. In the second phase, the most immunogenic multivalent vaccine (nine serogroups) was compared to sequential bivalent vaccines and monthly foot-bathing in a field trial in four commercial Merino flocks. The duration of protection afforded by the multivalent vaccine was likely to be less than that of the bivalent vaccines, as the antibody titres stimulated were lower and less persistent.

Here, we investigate the safety and efficacy of rLCMV in mice lacking a functional type I interferon system with high susceptibility to viral infections. Propagation-deficient rLCMV vector expressing ovalbumin as a model antigen is cleared from type I interferon receptor-deficient mice (Ifnar(-/-)) within seven days post vaccination. In Ifnar(-/-) , induction of vaccine antigen specific T cells is delayed compared to wild type animals. However, immunization of Ifnar(-/-) results in potent memory formation and generates multifunctional cytotoxic CDR+ T cells. Most importantly, Ifnar(-/-) vaccinated with rLCMV are protected from a challenge with the aggressive LCMV Clone 13. Our data provide evidence for an excellent safety profile with maintained efficacy in immunocompromised animals. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There are no published studies on the immune response following a Tdap booster dose in JIA patients so far. Objective: To evaluate the immune response and safety after a Tdap booster in JIA patients and in healthy adolescents. Methods: Nineteen adolescents with JIA according to the ILAR criteria on anti-TNF medication, 19 adolescents with JIA off anti-TNF medication, and 27 healthy adolescents (control group) were compared after a Tdap booster. Adverse events and disease activity were evaluated. Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed by flow cytometry. Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis toxin antibodies were assessed by ELISA; whole blood was stimulated with whole-cell pertussis, and supernatants were assessed for cytokines by xMAP. Results: The three groups showed a similar frequency of adverse events. There was no disease reactivation after the Tdap booster. Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis antibodies showed a significant response when D0 and D14 concentrations were compared in both JIA groups and controls. Over time, a different pattern of response to the Tdap booster was observed among the groups for tetanus antibodies (p = 0.005) but not for diphtheria and pertussis antibodies. In contrast to the protection attained for tetanus and diphtheria, in the three groups, not all individuals showed pertussis seroconversion at either D14 or D28. In addition, the seroconversion of three subjects with JIA on anti-TNF medication was not maintained at D28. JIA patients off anti-TNF showed a higher percentage of naive CD8 + T cells (p = 0.007) and central memory CD8 + cells (p = 0.003) and a lower percentage of effector CD8 + T cells (p = 0.003) and NK cell numbers (p = 0.018) than the control group. The JIA group off anti-TNF medication had fewer B lymphocytes than both the JIA group on anti-TNF medication and the control group (p = 0.016). Cellular immunity to Bordetella pertussis showed that IFN gamma levels were significantly lower in both JIA groups than in the control group (p = 0.003), IL10 levels were higher in the JIA off anti-TNF group (p = 0.009), IL17A and IL5 levels were lower in the JIA on anti-TNF group than in the control group (p = 0.018 and p = 0.016, respectively); however, an increase in IFN gamma (p = 0.008), IL17A (p = 0.030) and TNF alpha (p = 0.041) levels was observed at D14 in both patient groups. Both JIA groups showed higher levels of IL21 than the control group (p = 0.023). Conclusion: We conclude that individuals with JIA on or off anti-TNF agents showed a good response to a booster dose for the three antigens studied in the absence of major adverse events and without the reactivation of the disease.

Current adjuvants approved for human vaccines are mostly studied for their ability to improve antibody responses. There remains a need for development of novel adjuvants, especially those able to enhance cell-mediated immunity (CMI). In this preclinical study we assessed the effect of two novel adjuvants, a delta inulin microparticle Advax formulated with or without a toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CpG oligonucleotide, and a Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA proprietary lipid nanoparticle (LNP), on immune responses elicited by V160, an experimental replication-defective human cytomegalovirus vaccine. Adult rhesus macaques were immunized with a low dose of V160 (10 units) either alone or in combination with the adjuvants as compared to those immunized with a high dose of V160 alone (100 units). While neither adjuvant conferred a significant benefit to vaccine-elicited humoral immune responses at the dose tested, both enhanced cellular immune responses to V160, where Advax promoted both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and LNP predominantly impacted the CD4(+) T cell response. Transcriptome analyses of peripheral blood samples demonstrated different modes of action for these adjuvants. One day post vaccination, LNP induced upregulation of a large number of genes involved in the innate immune response similar to those triggered by viral infection. In contrast, Advax did not activate any known inflammatory pathways and did not significantly impact gene expression pattern until day 7 post administration, suggesting a unique, non inflammatory mechanism. These data warrant further exploration of Advax and LNP as adjuvants in clinical trials for vaccines desiring to elicit both humoral and T cell responses.

Non-specific sensory symptoms (NSSS) following immunization are thought to be mediated by stress-related responses. In this case-control study, we evaluated NSSS from a cohort of 7,812,845 BNT162b2 first-dose recipients, of whom 10,929 reported an adverse event following immunization (AEFI). We found an overall frequency of 3.4% (377 cases) or 4.8 cases per 100,000 doses administered. Anatomically, the arms (61%) and face/neck region (36.2%) were the most commonly affected sites. The control group had significantly higher rates of reactogenicityassociated symptoms, suggesting that NSSS are reactogenicity-independent; in multivariable analysis, healthcare workers reported sensory symptoms less frequently (aOR 0.54; 95% CI 0.40-0.72; p < 0.001). This is the first study describing the topography and associated factors for developing NSSS among BNT162b2 recipients. The benign nature of these symptoms may help dissipate hesitation towards this vaccine. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rotavirus (RV) vaccination was introduced into the national immunization program (NIP) in 2012 but has since been limited to one region due to cost con-siderations and conflicting local cost-effectiveness estimates. Updated estimates of the cost-effectiveness of RV vaccination are required to inform prioritization of national immunization activities. Methods: We calculated the potential costs and benefits of rotavirus vaccination over a 10-year-period (2021-2031) from a government and societal perspective, comparing four alternative rotavirus vaccines: Rotavac, Rotasiil, Rotarix and Rotateq. For each vaccine, a proportionate outcomes model was used to cal-culate the expected number of disease events, DALYs, vaccination program costs, and healthcare costs, with and without vaccination. The primary outcome measure was the cost per DALY averted. Assuming each product would generate similar benefits, the dominant (lowest cost) product was identi-fied. We then calculated the cost-effectiveness (US$ per Disability Adjusted Life Year [DALY] averted) of the least costly product and compared it to willingness-to-pay thresholds of 0.5 and 1 times the national GDP per capita ($3,485), and ran deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Introducing any of the four rotavirus vaccines would avert around 40% of RVGE visits, hospital-izations, and deaths over the period 2021-2031. Over the same ten-year period, the incremental cost of vaccination from a government perspective was estimated to be around $104, $105, $220, and $277 mil-lion for Rotavac, Rotasiil, Rotarix and Rotateq, respectively. The equivalent cost from a societal perspec-tive was $58, $60, $178 and $231 million. The cost-effectiveness of the least costly product (Rotavac) was $1,148 ($830-$1682) from a government perspective and $646 ($233-1277) from a societal perspective. All other products offered similar benefits but at a higher cost. There is a >99% probability that Rotavac would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold set at 0.5 times the national GDP per capita. Conclusion: Both Rotavac and Rotasiil are likely to be cost-effective options in the Philippines, but it is not possible to say definitively which product should be preferred. Rotarix and Rotateq are expected to offer similar benefits at more cost, so would need to be priced far more competitively to be considered for introduction. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Therefore, developing an improved vaccine is high priority. In this study, we cloned the genes of the immunodominant antigen of M. tuberculosis viz. its 38-kDa antigen (Pst homolog) (Rv0934, PstS1), and its T cell epitopes (amino acid [aa]169- 405 and [aa]802-1119), which we termed PstS1p. Prokaryotic expression showed that the two recombinant proteins were mainly in the form of inclusion bodies. We also evaluated the immunity and immunogenicity of PstS1 and PstS1p. Both PstS1 and its T cell epitopes elicited significantly higher antigen specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in mouse serum, indicating that they enhanced antibody response. They also elicited the T helper 1 (Th1)-type response and promoted CD4(+) T cell proliferation. Compared to PstS1, PstS1p promoted stronger cell-mediated immune response. These data indicate that PstS1p is highly immunogenic in mice, and may be a promising candidate vaccine for controlling tuberculosis. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional active surveillance focuses on predefined AEs. Advanced data mining tools could be used to identify unusual clusters of potential AEs after vaccination. Objective: To assess the feasibility of a novel tree-based statistical approach to the identification of AE clustering following the implementation of a varicella vaccination program among one-year-olds. Setting and participants: This nationwide safety surveillance was based on data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database and National Immunization Information System for the period 2004 through 2014. The study population was children aged 12-35 months who received the varicella vaccine. Exposure: First-dose varicella vaccine. Outcomes and measures: All incident ICD-9-CM diagnoses (emergency or inpatient departments) occur-ring 1-56 days after the varicella vaccination were classified within a hierarchical system of diagnosis categories using Multi-Level Clinical Classifications Software. A self-controlled tree-temporal data mining tool was then used to explore the incidence of AE clustering with a variety of potential risk intervals. The comparison interval consisted of days in the 56-day follow-up period that fell outside the risk interval. Results: Among 1,194,189 varicella vaccinees with no other same-day vaccinations, nine diagnoses with clustering features were categorized into four safety signals: fever on days 1-6 (attributable risk [AR] 38.5 per 100,000, p < 0.001), gastritis and duodenitis on days 1-2 (AR 5.9 per 100,000, p < 0.001), acute upper respiratory infection on days 1-5 (AR 11.0 per 100,000, p = 0.006), and varicella infection on days 1-9 (AR 2.7 per 100,000, p < 0.001). These safety profiles and their corresponding risk intervals have been identified in previous safety surveillance studies. Conclusions: Unexpected clusters of AEs were not detected after the mass administration of childhood varicella vaccines in Taiwan.

In this study, we estimated time varying vaccine effectiveness after 5 doses of aP vaccine. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among children 5-9 years old (born between 2008 and 2012) living in King County, Washington, USA, who participated in the Washington State Immunization Information System. We estimated time-varying vaccine effectiveness after 5 doses of aP using smoothed scaled Schoenfeld residuals obtained from fitting Cox proportional hazards models to the data as well as piecewise constant Poisson regression. Results: There were 55 pertussis cases in this cohort, of whom 22 (40%) were fully-vaccinated and 33 (60%) were under-vaccinated. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) remained high for up to 42 months after the fifth dose (VE(t) = 89%; 95% CI: 64%, 97%) as estimated using survival analysis methods and up to 4 years (VE (t) = 93%; 95% CI: 67%, 98%) as estimated using Poisson regression. Conclusion: We did not find evidence for waning of vaccine effectiveness for up to four years after 5 doses of aP among 5 -9 years old children in King County, WA. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The role of maturity in adolescent decision-making around HPV vaccination in France	VACCINE			English	Article						Human Papillomavirus; Vaccination; Adolescents; Maturity; Independence; Decision-making	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION; SELF-CONSENT; GIRLS; PERSPECTIVES; EXPERIENCES; JUDGMENT	Mothers are often responsible for vaccination decisions in the household. However, their confidence in certain vaccines such as Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines is eroding in some countries. France is one of the countries with the lowest HPV vaccine uptake in Europe, with parents delaying or refusing the vaccine for their adolescent daughters due to safety-and effectiveness-related concerns. Although parental consent is required for vaccination, adolescents' involvement in HPV vaccination decision making could improve vaccine uptake, with self-consent procedures already introduced in some countries. Adolescents' capacity to engage in decision-making is influenced by their maturity and autonomy in health. This study explored the role of maturity in decision-making around HPV vaccination in France through qualitative interviews with adolescent girls (n = 24) and their mothers (n = 21) and two focus groups with adolescent girls (n = 12). A codebook approach to thematic analysis revealed that adolescent girls' involvement in HPV decision-making is a process that evolved with maturity. As adolescents progressed towards maturity at different speeds, some expressed childlike traits such as impulsive decisions and others described more rational, reflective decision-making. Despite these differences, most adolescents in this study described a passive role in HPV vaccination decision-making, following their parents' lead. However, their expressed desire for information and involvement in discussions indicates that their lack of engagement may not only be due to a lack of maturity but also a result of mothers and doctors excluding them from getting involved. Furthermore, as health behaviours are shaped during adolescence, the influence of vaccine hesitant mothers on their daughters' own views and beliefs could be significant, together with exposure to regular controversies in the mainstream media. Individualised approaches to engage adolescents in decision-making around their own health are needed, for example through strengthening discussions and information around HPV vaccination with parents and doctors.

Influenza immunization coverage of children with sickle cell disease	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza immunization; Sickle cell disease; Immunization registry		Objectives: To assess receipt of annual flu immunization among children living with sickle cell disease (SCD). Methods: Receipt of flu immunization (2014-2019) by SCD status was assessed among all Michigan chil-dren <18 years of age using the statewide immunization registry. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of annual flu immunization by SCD status and age. Results: Annual flu immunization coverage was higher among children with SCD (46.9%; n = 751) than without (23.2%; n = 2,012,846). The annual adjusted odds of flu immunization for those with SCD were 2.8 (95% CI: 2.5-3.1) times higher than for those without SCD; there were no significant differences by age among children with SCD. Among those without SCD, adolescents aged 13-17 were 2.2 (95% CI: 2.2-2.2) times less likely to receive annual flu immunization than children 6-35 months. Conclusions: Children with SCD had higher annual flu immunization rates than those without SCD, but >50% remain unimmunized. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These include atomic-level structures driving immunogen design, new vaccine delivery methods, powerful adjuvants, and novel animal models. In addition, utilizing advanced assays to learn how the immune system senses a pathogen and orchestrates protective immunity has been critical in the design of effective vaccines and therapeutics. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health convened a workshop in September 2020 focused on next generation assays for vaccine development (Table 1). The workshop focused on four critical pathogens: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-which have no licensed vaccines-and tuberculosis (TB) and influenza-both of which are in critical need of improved vaccines. The goal was to share progress and lessons learned, and to identify any commonalities that can be leveraged to design vaccines and therapeutics.	[D'Souza, M.

Cost of vaccine delivery strategies in low- and middle-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic	VACCINE			English	Article						Immunization; Cost; COVID-19	EXPANDED PROGRAM; CHOLERA-VACCINE; EBOLA OUTBREAK; IMMUNIZATION; HEALTH; IMPACT; POPULATION; AFRICA; RISK	Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted immunization services critical to the prevention of vaccine-preventable diseases in many low-and middle-income countries around the world. These services will need to be modified in order to minimize COVID-19 transmission and ensure the safety of health workers and the community. Additional budget will be required to implement these modifications that ensure safe delivery. Methods: Using a simple modeling analysis, we estimated the additional resource requirements associated with modifications to supplementary immunization activities (campaigns) and routine immunization services via fixed sites and outreach in 2020 US dollars. We considered the following four categories of costs: (1) personal protective equipment (PPE) & infection prevention and control (IPC) measures for immunization sessions; (2) physical distancing and screening during immunization sessions; (3) delivery strategy changes, such as changes in session sizes and frequency; and (4) other operational cost increases, including additional social mobilization, training, and hazard pay to compensate health workers. Results: We found that implementing a range of measures to protect health workers and communities from COVID-19 transmission could result in a per-facility start-up cost of $466-799 for routine fixed site delivery and $12-220 for routine outreach delivery, and $12-108 per immunization campaign site. A recurrent monthly cost of $137-1,024 for fixed-site delivery and $152-848 for outreach delivery per facility could be incurred, and a $0.32-0.85 increase in the cost per dose during campaigns. Conclusions: By illustrating potential cost implications of providing immunization services through a range of strategies in a safe manner, these estimates can provide a benchmark for program managers and policy makers on the additional budget required. These findings can help country practitioners and global development partners planning the continuation of immunization services in the context of COVID-19. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

COVID-19 vaccine capacity: Challenges and mitigation-The DCVMN perspective	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Vaccine supply; Technology transfer; Clinical trials		Vaccine manufacturers from developing countries have a proven track record of developing, producing, and supplying high-quality vaccines globally. However, due to the complexity of vaccine manufacturing, numerous stakeholder organizations support manufacturers across a variety of functions. To optimize the support from stakeholders it is instrumental to first understand which manufacturing processes these manufacturers require support for and what support functions are most beneficial. To this end, the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network designed a comprehensive survey to assess the specific needs of the Network's member organizations. We found that almost all sampled manufacturers are interested in obtaining funding or technology transfers for COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, results indicated that manufacturers have a strong appetite for modern technology platforms, particularly RNA technologies. Scale-up, phase III clinical trials, and formulation were also key processes for which manufacturers require support. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CYD-TDV is the first dengue vaccine to be licensed, but global uptake has been hampered due to its use being limited to seropositive persons aged 9 years and above, and the need for a 3-dose schedule. The Partnership for Dengue Control (PDC) organized a meeting with key opinion leaders and stakeholders to deliberate on implementation strategies for the use of CYD-TDV. New data have emerged that support the shortening of the primary schedule from a 3 to 2 dose schedule, extending the age range below 9 to 6 years of age, and expanding the indication from endemic populations to also include travelers to endemic areas. Cost-effectiveness may improve with the modified 2-dose regimen and with multiple testing. Strategies to implement a dengue vaccination program have been developed, in particular school-based strategies. A range of delivery scenarios can then be considered, using various settings for each step of the intervention. However, several challenges remain, including communication about limiting the use of this vaccine to seropositive individuals only. Affordability will vary from country to country, as will government commitment and community acceptance. Well-tailored communication strategies that target key stakeholders are expected to make up a significant part of any future dengue vaccination program.

The objective of this study is to describe health care providers' perspectives and experience regarding the implementation of maternal immunization programs in Latin America. Methods: We conducted 33 in-depth interviews of health care providers from Argentina, Brazil, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru (6-7 per country). Qualitative data analysis was conducted using a combination of both manual techniques and the computer software program NVivo. We identified and coded main themes related to maternal immunization. Results: The main themes identified in this analysis were practices related to maternal immunization, knowledge and training, resource availability and interactions with pregnant women. Healthcare providers knew that recommendations exists but some did not know their content; they expressed concerns about insufficient training. Providers from all five countries expressed the need for additional human resources and supplies. They also expressed a desire for women to be more proactive and ask more questions during the health visits. Conclusion: This is the first multi-country study assessing the perspectives of health care providers about maternal immunization practices at the facility level in Latin America. Recommendations based on the results from this study include implementing additional trainings around maternal immunization, especially targeting obstetricians and midwives. These trainings should be conducted in coordination with improvements to supply chain and other structural issues. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed at estimating that risk relative to non-vaccination among girls, by using the Spanish Primary Care Database for Pharmacoepidemiological Research (BIFAP). Methods: A cohort study of girls aged 9-18 years during 2007-2016 free of GBS or HPVv was selected and followed up to GBS diagnosis. Follow-up time was divided by time-varying HPVv exposure and confounders. Crude Incidence rates (IR per 1,000,000 person-years (py)) and adjusted Hazard Ratios (HR) of GBS were estimated anytime after vaccination compared to non-exposed periods. HRs were also estimated for the first 90 days after HPVv (risk-window) and thereafter. Results: Out of 388,849 girls, of which 154,255 were vaccinated, 6 'confirmed' GBS cases occurred during non-exposure periods (IR of 5.83 per million person-years; 95% CI: 2.62-12.97) and 3 'confirmed' cases anytime after vaccination (IR of 7.87; 95% CI: 2.54-24.39). The resulting adjusted HR anytime after vaccination was 1.24 (95% CI: 0.19-8.00). All three cases occurred after the risk window of 90 days with an HR of 1.77 (95% CI: 0.25-12.54) for post-exposure periods as compared with non-exposure. Since zero cases occurred during the risk window, no HR could be estimated for exposed periods. Conclusions: Incidences of GBS were in line with the range previously reported for young people, supporting the potential of BIFAP for performing studies on GBS. However, a lack of power may be present for quantifying the relative risk of such a rare disease after the vaccination among the study cohort, where we can only exclude an increased risk of 8-times relative to no vaccination.

However, there are currently no reports with D614G as vaccine candidate. Here we report the development of an mRNA-LNP vaccine with D614G variant and characterization in animal model. We have used special mRNA-architecture and formulation that provides suitable response of the product. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data with spike protein (S) revealed that immunization generated specific antibody pools against the whole extracellular domain (RBD and S2) of the spike protein. The anti-sera and purified IgGs from immunized mice neutralized SARS-CoV-2-pseudoviruses in ACE2expressing HEK293 cells in a dose dependent manner. Importantly, single-dose immunization protected mice-lungs from homotypic-pseudovirus entry and cytopathy. The immunologic responses have been implicated by a balanced and stable population of CD4+ cells with a Th1 bias. The data suggested great promise for immediate translation of the technology to the clinic. (c) 2021 Globe Biotech Limited. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, China has not adopted PCVs in their national immunization schedules and had only approved these vaccines for children aged 2-15 months by 2020. Methods: In an open-label trial, enrolled healthy children aged 2-5 years old were randomized 1:1 and divided into a 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) group and a Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (Hib) group. Children in the PCV7 group received a single dose of PCV7, and the Hib group received a single dose of Hib vaccine. Blood samples were collected before and 6 months after vac-cination. Immunogenicity and safety of PCV7 were assessed at prespecified time points. Results: Six months after a single dose of PCV7, children in the PCV7 group for all 7 serotypes, IgG mean concentrations (GMCs) and opsonophagocytic geometric mean titres (GMTs) were significantly higher (P < .001) than at baseline, and the proportion of IgG > 0.35 mg/mL ranged from 90.0% to 100%. Although the antibody level increased with age, preexisting antibodies did not induce hyporesponsive-ness to PCV7. In the Hib group, the antibody levels were not significantly different or had changed slightly at 6 months. PCV7 was well tolerated in all age groups, and no serious adverse events (AEs) emerged dur -ing this study. Conclusions: A single dose of PCV7 was immunogenic and safe for Chinese children aged 2-5 years, and the preexisting antibodies against the PCV7 serotypes did not change the response to vaccination. The findings supported the effectiveness of PCV7 in this age group. PCVs with broader serotype coverage are expected to expand pneumococcal disease protection. (c) 2021 The Authors.

We present a phase 3 immunogenicity and safety study of the 9vHPV vaccine in women 27-45 versus 16-26 years of age. Methods: This international, open-label study (NCT03158220) was conducted in women 16-45 years of age. Participants (16-26 years, n = 570 and 27-45 years, n = 642) received a three-dose 9vHPV vaccination regimen (day 1, month 2, month 6). Month 7 geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion percentages to anti-HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 were assessed. Participants were followed for safety throughout the study. Results: At month 7, anti-HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 GMTs in women 27-45 years were compared to those in women 16-26 years of age. The primary hypothesis of non-inferiority of anti-HPV 16/18/31/33/45/52/58 GMTs in older versus younger women was met. The lower bound of the GMT ratio 95% confidence interval (27-45 years to 16-26 years) was 0.60-0.67 depending on HPV type, exceeding the non-inferiority margin of 0.5 for all HPV types. Month 7 seroconversion percentages in women 27- 45 years of age were >99% for all HPV types. Injection-site and vaccine-related systemic adverse events (AEs) were observed in 87.5% and 25.1% of women 16-26 years, and 85.2% and 24.1% of women 27- 45 years of age, respectively; no vaccine-related serious AEs were reported and no deaths occurred during the study. Conclusions: The 9vHPV vaccine elicited non-inferior anti-HPV GMTs in women 27-45 years compared with women 16-26 years of age for HPV 16/18/31/33/45/52/58. The vaccine was generally well tolerated with a similar AE profile across the age groups. These data support bridging 9vHPV vaccine efficacy findings in women 16-26 years to women 27-45 years of age.

A multisite study of pertussis vaccine effectiveness by time since last vaccine dose from three Canadian provinces: A Canadian Immunization Research Network study	VACCINE			English	Article						Immunization; Pertussis; Vaccine effectiveness; Waning immunity; Meta-analysis	WHOLE-CELL; WANING PROTECTION; DURATION	Background: Pertussis remains poorly controlled relative to other diseases targeted by childhood vaccination programs. We combined estimates from four population-based studies of pertussis vaccine effectiveness (VE) in three Canadian provinces using a meta-analytic approach to improve precision and explore regional variation in VE and durability of protection. Methods: Studies were conducted in Alberta, Manitoba, and Ontario over periods ranging from 1996 to 2015. Adjusted log odds ratios (OR; VE = 100*[1-OR]) of the effect of vaccination on pertussis risk were estimated by time since last vaccination in each study and pooled using DerSimonian and Laird random effects models. We used the I-2 statistic to estimate between-study heterogeneity and assessed methodological and clinical heterogeneity through subgroup analyses of study design and age. Results: Data on 3,270 pertussis cases and 23,863 controls were available. Pertussis VE declined from 86% (95% CI 79%-90%, I-2 = 81.5%) at < 1 year since last vaccination to 51% (11%-74%, I-2 = 80.9%) by >= 8 years. Effect estimates were the most heterogeneous in the least and most elapsed time periods since last vaccine dose. This was attributable mostly to variation between provinces in the distribution of age groups and number of vaccine doses received within time periods, as well as study design and small numbers in the most elapsed time period. Interpretation: Consistent trends of decreasing pertussis VE with increasing time since last vaccination across three Canadian provinces indicate the need for immunization schedules and vaccine development to optimize protection for all individuals, especially for adolescents and young adults at greatest risk of infection.

NIH funding for vaccine readiness before the COVID-19 pandemic	VACCINE			English	Article						NIH Funding; Vaccine; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2	CORONAVIRUS VACCINE	Rapid development of vaccines for COVID-19 has relied on the application of existing vaccine technologies. This work examines the maturity of ten technologies employed in candidate vaccines (as of July 2020) and NIH funding for published research on these technologies from 2000-2019. These technologies vary from established platforms, which have been used successfully in approved products, to emerging technologies with no prior clinical validation. A robust body of published research on vaccine technologies was supported by 16,358 fiscal years of NIH funding totaling $17.2 billion from 2000-2019. During this period, NIH funding for published vaccine research against specific pandemic threats such as coronavirus, Zika, Ebola, and dengue was not sustained. NIH funding contributed substantially to the advance of technologies available for rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines, suggesting the importance of sustained public sector funding for foundational technologies in the rapid response to emerging public health threats.

While the Oka strain is commonly used for varicella vaccination worldwide, Korea widely uses the MAV/06 strain. A new live attenuated MAV/06 strain varicella vaccine (MG1111), which uses the new cell line Medical Research Council-5 for better viral propagation, was developed. MG1111 was approved by Korean health authorities. Here, we report the results of phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study conducted in Korea and Thailand, which compared the immunogenicity and safety profiles of MG1111 versus the control vaccine, VarivaxTM. In total, 515 healthy children (12 month-12 years) were randomized 1:1 to receive either the MG1111 or control vaccine (MG1111: 258, Control: 257). The seroconversion rate (SCR) and geometric mean titer (GMT) were measured using the fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen (FAMA) test. The MG1111 group achieved a SCR of 97.9% (95% CI: 95.2-99.3) after vaccination. The lower limit of 95% CI for SCR difference (MG1111-Varivax (TM)) was -4.0%, which was higher than the specified non-inferiority margin of -10%. Further, the GMT of the MG1111 increased from 2.0 to 74.2 (95% CI: 65.0-84.8) and the lower limits of the 95% CI for post-vaccination GMT ratios (MG1111/Varivax (TM)) were 0.55 higher than the specified parameter of 0.5. Therefore, the MG1111 group was not statistically inferior to the control vaccine group in terms of SCR and GMT. Furthermore, the MG1111 and control vaccine groups were not significantly different in the percentage of participants showing adverse events-solicited, local, or systemic during 43-day period of observation and serious adverse events during 6 month of observation. The present results indicate that MG1111 was not immunologically inferior to VarivaxTM, and safety profiles of MG1111 are similar to those of Varivax (TM). (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The relative contribution of each of these disease categories to the reported savings remains to be explored. Methods: During a recently completed study of HD versus SD vaccine effectiveness (conducted in the VHA over five respiratory seasons from 2010/11 through 2014/15), we collected cost data for all healthcare services provided at both VHA and Medicare-funded facilities. In that analysis, we compared the costs of vaccination and hospital care for patients admitted with either cardiovascular or respiratory disease. Treatment selection bias and other confounding factors were adjusted using an instrumental variable (IV) method. In this brief report we use the same study cohort and methods to stratify the results by patients admitted for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and those admitted for respiratory disease. Results: We analyzed 3.5 million SD and 0.16 million HD person-seasons. The IV-adjusted rVEs were 14% (7-20%) against hospitalizations for CVD and 15% (5-25%) against respiratory hospitalizations. Net cost savings per HD recipient were $138 ($66-$200) for CVD related hospitalizations and $62 ($10-$107) for respiratory disease related hospitalizations. Conclusions: In the US VHA population, the reduction in hospitalizations for CVD over five respiratory seasons contributed twice the cost savings (per HD recipient) of the reduction in hospitalizations for respiratory disease.

An observational study of antibody responses to a primary or subsequent pertussis booster vaccination in Australian healthcare workers	VACCINE			English	Article						Pertussis; Tdap; Booster; Vaccination; Tetanus; Diphtheria; IgG; Immune memory; Immunogenicity; Antibody waning; Adults; Whooping cough	ANTIGEN-CONTENT DIPHTHERIA; TETANUS-ACELLULAR PERTUSSIS; BORDETELLA-PERTUSSIS; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; HOUSEHOLD EXPOSURE; SERUM ANTIBODIES; WHOLE-CELL; ADULTS; ADOLESCENTS; IMMUNIZATION	Adult pertussis vaccination is increasingly recommended to control pertussis in the community. However, there is little data on the duration and kinetics of immunity to pertussis boosters in adults. We compared IgG responses to vaccination with a tetanus, low-dose diphtheria, low-dose acellular pertussis (Tdap) booster at 1 week, 1 month and 1 year post-vaccination in whole-cell (wP)-primed Australian paediatric healthcare workers who had received an adult Tdap booster 5-12 years previously, to those who received their first Tdap booster. Tdap vaccination was well tolerated in both groups. Previously boosted adults had significantly higher pre-vaccination IgG concentrations for all vaccine-antigens, and more were seropositive for pertussis toxin (PT)-specific IgG (>= 5 IU/mL) (69.5%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 59.5-79.5) than adults in the naive group (45.2%; 95% CI 32.8-57.5). Tdap vaccination significantly increased IgG responses 1 month post-vaccination in both groups. This increase was more rapid in previously boosted than in naive adults, with geometric mean fold-increases in PT-IgG at 1 week post vaccination of 3.6 (95% CI 2.9-4.3) and 2.6 (95% CI 2.2-3.2), respectively. Antibody waning between 1 month and 1 year post-vaccination was similar between groups for IgG specific to PT and filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA), but was faster for IgG against pertactin (PRN) in the naive group (GMC ratio 0.36; 95% CI 0.31-0.42) than the previously boosted group (GMC ratio 0.45; 95% CI 0.39-0.50). At baseline, all but one adult had protective IgG titres against tetanus toxin (TT) (>= 0.1 IU/mL), and 75.6% in the previously boosted and 61.3% in the naive group had protective IgG titres against diphtheria toxoid (DT) of >= 0.1 IU/mL. This study shows that pertussis immune memory is maintained up to 12 years after Tdap vaccination in wP-primed Australian adults. There was no evidence that pertussis immune responses waned faster after a booster dose. These findings support current recommendations of repeating Tdap booster vaccination in paediatric healthcare workers at least every 10 years. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the importance of this as a barrier to universal vaccination coverage, rigorous studies looking at ways to reduce vaccine stockouts have been limited. We causally evaluated the effect of Vaccine Direct Delivery (VDD), an intervention to ensure the vaccine stock availability at health facilities, on the reduction of stockouts in Bauchi state, Nigeria. Methods: Employing the interrupted time-series method, we evaluated the change in the occurrence of vaccine stockouts before and after the introduction of VDD in July 2015. We used health facility level data from January 2013 to December 2018 among 175 facilities in Bauchi state, collected through the District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2) for monthly information on stockouts and stock balances in all the health facilities in Nigeria. Data were analyzed using Stata 15 SE. To validate the causal relationship between VDD and vaccine stockouts, we conducted two sets of robustness checks. First, we evaluated the effect of VDD on the stockouts of other commodities. Second, we compared the trend of the prevalence of vaccine stockouts among health facilities between Bauchi state where VDD was introduced and another state (Adamawa state) where VDD was never introduced. Results: After the introduction of VDD, vaccine stockouts in Bauchi state decreased by 9 percentage points on average, and they have been decreasing monthly by 0.4 percentage points more than pre-VDD. In Adamawa state, where VDD was never introduced, the prevalence of vaccine stockouts did not change over time. In Bauchi state after VDD introduction, the stock balances of target vaccines all increased, and the number of vaccinations carried out increased in neighboring health facilities. Conclusions: VDD intervention resulted in a significant reduction of vaccine stockouts as well as in an increase in the number of vaccinations performed. However, we should consider how to improve the system to provide vaccination service to the population in a sustainable way. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence and investigate how the differences in schedules influence titres over time. Methods: Four databases were searched from inception to January 2020 for rabies PrEP and PEP studies. A dose-response meta-analysis was utilised to pool geometric mean titres (GMT) over time. Subgroup analyses by route of administration, age group, and schedule were conducted. Results: 80 studies met the inclusion criteria and contributed with 191 datasets and 12,413 participants. Both intradermal (ID) and intramuscular (IM) PrEP/PEP produce adequate GMTs. Significantly lower GMT levels were achieved in older (>50yrs) compared to younger (<50yrs) participants. Short 1-week schedules were as effective as longer schedules that can take between 3 and 12 weeks to complete. Conclusions: Several effective ID and IM schedules were identified, the selection of a schedule should take into account the patient's needs, costs, availability to return for subsequent doses, and the time required to complete the schedule. Older individuals warrant special attention as they develop lower antibody response. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Xu, Chang; Doi, Suhail A.

Clinical development shows promising results and several candidates may be progressing to licensure in the coming years. This study aimed at exploring future acceptance and uptake of such regimens (also called heterologous prime-boost) and to identify implementation-associated benefits and challenges. Survey tools were developed based on findings from a previous literature search shared with the study team, and exploratory interviews with global stakeholders. An online survey and key informant interviews in six countries were conducted with stakeholders at national and sub-national level, including policy-makers, regulators and implementers. The interview guide and the online survey covered: (a) awareness of, and knowledge about, heterologous vaccine regimens; (b) rating of regimen-associated perceived benefits and challenges; (c) anticipation of possible challenges in relation to four hypothetical introduction scenarios; (d) potential acceptance benefits and challenges at the policy, health facility and recipient level. Sixty-two interviews were conducted at national level. The online survey was completed by 50 participants. Across the four introduction scenarios, respondents considered the highest potential for the introduction of heterologous regimens for immunoprophylaxis was among adolescents/adults for diseases against which no vaccines are currently available. Most reservations were related to logistics, record keeping, and recipient compliance. Adding a new heterologous vaccine regimen to the routine immunization calendar for children was considered feasible if it could generate an increased and longer-term immune response. Introduction in preparation of or following a disease outbreak was considered less favourably, with respondents stressing the difficulty of logistics in emergency situations, and the potential lag in the onset of protection. The recent approval of the first heterologous vaccine regimen for the prevention of Ebola Virus Disease will soon bring new light to the topic. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Trends in the uptake of pediatric measles-containing vaccine in the United States: A Disneyland effect?	VACCINE			English	Article						Measles; Vaccination; Immunization; Vaccine coverage; Undervaccination; Vaccine hesitancy; NIS-Child	OUTBREAK; ELIMINATION; HESITANCY; IMPACT; BELIEF; MEDIA	Background: The measles outbreak that began in December 2014 at the California Disneyland theme park in the United States (U.S.) received a high amount of media attention. Media attention can influence health-related behaviors. We investigated the effect of the Disneyland outbreak on measles-containing vaccine (MCV) uptake among U.S. children. Methods: We used 2012-2017 National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child) data to examine MCV uptake among U.S. children by 19 months of age. We classified MCV coverage among birth cohorts as exposed based on age at the time of the outbreak. A difference-in-differences design with adjustment for categorical birth cohort was implemented in base models to estimate the exposure effect on the outcomes, >= 1-dose MCV coverage or age at first MCV dose, with pneumococcal conjugate vaccination as a control. Primary analyses included this model adjusted for geographic region, maternal education, race/ethnicity, household income, and insurance status, and an exposure-interaction term with maternal education. All analyses included sampling weights. Results: The study population represented 34,471,357 children. In base models, the Disneyland outbreak was associated with a 1.0% (95% CI: 0.2%, 1.8%) increase in >= 1-dose MCV coverage and a 6.6 (95% CI: 4.8, 8.5)-day decrease in MCV administration age. In primary analyses, the outbreak was associated with a 3.9% (95% CI: 3.1%, 4.8%) increase in >= 1-dose MCV coverage among children of college-educated mothers, and a 3.2% (95% CI: 0.6%, 5.9%) decrease among children of mothers earning less than a high school degree. Decreases in MCV administration age ranging from 5.9 (95% CI: 3.3, 8.5) to 9.1 (95% CI: 6.8, 11.4) days were observed across maternal education categories. Conclusions: The Disneyland outbreak was associated with differential effects on MCV coverage by maternal education and decreases in MCV administration age among U.S. children. These findings may provide useful insights to inform methods to address pediatric MCV undervaccination. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Immune response to the vaccine is associated with multiple factors in early childhood and measured by antibody titers. Among them, micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin D and zinc deficiencies are the most important in resource-limited settings like Bangladesh. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the association of vaccine response to low serum zinc and vitamin D levels in children. Methods: We evaluated vaccine response for measles and poliovirus, tetanus and pertussis toxoid, and Ig A antibody levels to rotavirus by ELISA and serum vitamin D and zinc at 7 and 15 months in the MAL-ED birth cohort of the Bangladesh site. By using population-specific generalized estimating equations (GEE), the association between each explanatory variable and the binary outcome variable was examined longitudinally where the dependent variable was vaccine titers and the independent variables were low serum vitamin D and zinc levels. Results: The GEE multivariable model identified a positive association between serum zinc level and tetanus vaccine titer (OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.07-3.17 and p value = 0.028) after adjusting for age, gender, birth weight, WAMI score, diarrhea, ALRI, exclusive breastfeeding, serum ferritin, serum retinol and undernutrition (stunting, wasting, underweight). No association was found between the rest of the vaccine titers with serum vitamin D and zinc level (p > 0.05). Conclusion: In the MAL-ED birth cohort, where children were followed for five years, serum zinc level had a positive impact on tetanus vaccine titers. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Methods: We developed a dynamic transmission model to simulate the impact of infant vaccination with whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccine with and without maternal aP immunization. The model was calibrated to Brazilian surveillance data and then used to project health outcomes and costs under alternative strategies in Brazil, and, after adjusting model parameter values to reflect their conditions, in Nigeria and Bangladesh. The primary measure of cost-effectiveness is incremental cost (2014 USD) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY). Results: The dynamic model shows that maternal aP immunization would be cost-effective in Brazil, a middle-income country, under the base-case assumptions, but would be very expensive at infant vaccination coverage in and above the threshold range necessary to eliminate the disease (90-95%). At 2007 infant coverage (DTP1 90%, DTP3 61% at 1 year of age), maternal immunization would cost < $4,000 per DALY averted. At high infant coverage, such as Brazil in 1996 (DTP1 94%, DTP3 74% at 1 year), cost/DALY increases to $1.27 million. When the model's time horizon was extended from 2030 to 2100, cost/DALY increased under both infant coverage levels, but more steeply with high coverage. The results were moderately sensitive to discount rate, maternal vaccine price, and maternal aP coverage and were robust using the 100 best-fitting parameter sets. Scenarios representing low-income countries showed that maternal aP immunization could be cost-saving in countries with low infant coverage, such as Nigeria, but very expensive in countries, such as Bangladesh, with high infant coverage. Conclusion: A dynamic model, which captures the herd immunity benefits of pertussis vaccination, shows that, in low- and middle-income countries, maternal aP immunization is cost-effective when infant vaccination coverage is moderate, even cost-saving when it is low, but not cost-effective when coverage levels pass 90-95%.

Influenza-associated mortality in Australia, 2010 through 2019: High modelled estimates in 2017	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza mortality; Epidemiology; Cause of death; Influenza subtypes; Statistical modelling; Time series analysis, vaccine effectiveness	VIRUS	Introduction: In Australia, the 2017 and 2019 influenza seasons were severe. High-dose or adjuvanted vaccines were introduced for >= 65 year-olds in 2018. Aim: To compare influenza-associated mortality in 2017 and 2019 with the average for 2010-2019. Methods: We used time series modelling to obtain estimates of influenza-associated death rates for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B in Australia, in persons of all ages and <65, 65-74 and >= 75 years. Estimates were made for pneumonia and influenza (P8:I, 2010-2018), respiratory (2010-2018), and all-cause outcomes (2010-2019). Results: During 2010 through 2018 (and 2019 for all-cause), influenza was estimated to be associated with an annual average of 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9, 2.4), 4.0 (95% CI 3.4, 4.6), and 11.6 (95% CI 8.4, 15.0) P8:I, respiratory and all-cause deaths per 100,000 population, respectively. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was estimated to be associated with less than one quarter of influenza-associated P8:I and respiratory deaths, while A(H3N2) and B were each estimated to contribute approximately equally to the remaining influenza-associated deaths. In 2017, the respective rates were 7.8 (95% CI 7.1, 8.4), 12.3 (95% CI 10.9, 13.6) and 26.0 (95% CI 20.8, 32.0) per 100,000. In 2019, the all-cause estimate was 20.8 (95% CI 14.9, 26.7) per 100,000. Conclusions: Seasonal influenza continues to be associated with substantial mortality in Australia, with at least double the average occurring in 2017. Age-specific monitoring of vaccine effectiveness is needed in Australia to understand higher mortality seasons. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We retrospectively evaluated SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit 1 (S1)-specific antibody levels after two mRNA doses in 242 patients with underlying chronic inflammatory, hematooncological or metabolic diseases and in solid organ transplant recipients. S1-specific antibodies were measured 30 days after the second dose. In 15.9% of these patients, no S1-specific antibodies were detectable. Non-responsiveness was linked to administration of B-cell depleting therapies as well as to ongoing therapies that block lymphocyte trafficking (Fingolimod) or inhibit T cell proliferation (Tacrolimus). Thus, it is important to inform immunosuppressed patients about the risk of vaccine nonresponsiveness and the necessity to maintain non-pharmaceutical protection measures. In these risk patients antibody testing and cellular analysis are helpful to estimate the benefit/responsiveness to further booster vaccinations. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Today, 14 candidates are in clinical development inside the global TB vaccine pipeline. MTBVAC is one of these candidates. Based on a live-attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolate, MTBVAC's 25 years of vaccine discovery, construction and characterisation have followed Pasteur principles, and in the process, BCG has served as a reference gold standard for establishing the safety and protective efficacy of new TB vaccine candidates. MTBVAC, which contains the antigen repertoire of M. tuberculosis, is now poised to initiate Phase 3 efficacy trials in newborns in TB-endemic countries. BCG's efficacy extends beyond that against TB, shown to confer heterologous non-specific immunity to other diseases and reduce all-cause mortality in the first months of life. Today, WHO recognises the importance that any new TB vaccine designed for administration at birth, should show similar nonspecific benefits as BCG via mechanisms of trained immunity and/or cross-reactivity of adaptive immune responses to other pathogens. Key recent studies provide strong support for MTBVAC's ability of inducing trained immunity and conferring non-specific heterologous protection similar to BCG. Research on alternative delivery routes of MTBVAC, such as a clinically feasible aerosol route, could facilitate vaccine administration for long-term TB eradication programmes in the future.

In 2020, the Vaccine Innovation Prioritisation Strategy (VIPS) prioritized three innovations, namely microarray patches (MAPs), heat-stable and controlled-temperature chain (CTC) enabled liquid vaccine formulations and barcodes on primary packaging. These innovations were prioritized based on the priority immunization barriers that they may help overcome in resource constrained contexts, as well as by considering their potential impact on health, coverage and equity, safety, economic costs and their technical readiness and commercial feasibility. VIPS is now working to accelerate the development and lay the foundation for future uptake of the three priority vaccine-product innovations, with the long term-goal to ensure equitable vaccine coverage and increased impact of vaccines in low-and middle-income countries. To inform our strategic planning, we analyzed four commercially available vaccine product-innovations and conducted interviews with individuals from 17 immunization organizations, and/or independent immunization experts. The findings are synthesized into an 'innovation conundrum' that describes the challenges encountered in developing vaccine-product innovations and a vaccine-product innovation 'theory of change', which highlights actions that should be undertaken in parallel to product development to incentivize sustainable investment and prepare the pathway for uptake and impact.

One of the primary decisions for a vaccine ordering decision-maker is how to allocate the limited resources between different types of vaccines effectively. We studied the tradeoff between efficacy and reach of the two vaccine types that become available at different times. Methods: We extended a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIR-D) model with vaccination, ran extensive simulations with different settings, and compared the level of infection attack rate (IAR) under different reach ratios between two vaccine types under different resource allocation decisions. Results: We found that when there were limited resources, allocating resources to a vaccine with high efficacy that became available earlier than a vaccine with lower efficacy did not always lead to a lower IAR, particularly if the former could vaccinate less than 42.5% of the population (with the selected study parameters) who could have received the latter. Sensitivity analyses showed that this result stayed robust under different study parameters. Conclusions: Our results showed that a vaccine with lower resource requirements (wider reach) can significantly contribute to reducing IAR, even if it becomes available later in the pandemic, compared to a higher efficacy vaccine that becomes available earlier but requires more resources. Limited resource in vaccine distribution is significant challenge in many parts of the world that needs to be addressed to improve the global access to life-saving vaccines. Understanding the tradeoffs between efficacy and reach is critical for resource allocation decisions between different vaccine types for improving health outcomes. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

A new fully liquid formulation in a single vial has been developed to further improve the vaccine presentation. Since the MenA structure is subject to hydrolytic degradation, this study was conducted to compare the immunogenicity and safety of the investigational MenACWY-CRM liquid vaccine with the licensed vaccine. Methods: In this multicentre, randomised, controlled, observer-blind, phase 2b study, 979 healthy adults were administered a single dose of MenACWY-CRM liquid presentation or the currently licensed MenACWY-CRM vaccine. MenA free saccharide generation was accelerated to approximately 30% in the liquid presentation and MenA polysaccharide O-acetylation was reduced to approximately 40%, according to a controlled procedure. Immunological non-inferiority of the MenACWY-CRM liquid to the licensed vaccine, as measured by human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) geometric mean titres (GMTs) against MenA 1 month post-vaccination, was the primary study objective. Safety assessment was among the secondary objectives. Results: Immune responses against each serogroup were similar between the two vaccine groups and was non-inferior for MenA. Adjusted hSBA GMTs for MenA were 185.16 and 211.33 for the MenACWY-CRM liquid presentation and currently licensed vaccine presentation, respectively. The between-group ratio of hSBA GMTs for MenA was 0.88, with a two-sided 95% confidence interval lower limit of 0.64, greater than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 0.5, thus meeting the primary study objective. Both vaccines were well tolerated. No serious adverse events were considered related to vaccination. Conclusions: The levels of MenA free saccharide and polysaccharide O-acetylation did not affect the immunogenicity of the fully liquid presentation, which was demonstrated to be non-inferior to the immunogenicity of the currently licensed MenACWY-CRM vaccine against MenA. The immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety profiles of the two vaccine presentations were similar. (c) 2021 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A case-control study nested in the Danish national birth cohort	VACCINE			English	Article						HPV-vaccination; Adverse events; Vulnerability; Self-rated health; Frequent health complaints	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION; GENERAL-PRACTITIONER ATTENDANCE; HEALTH COMPLAINTS; ABDOMINAL-PAIN; CHILDREN; RISK; ADOLESCENCE; AUTOIMMUNE; SYMPTOMS; CRISIS	Previous studies have indicated that girls experiencing suspected adverse events (AE) following HPV vaccination were more vulnerable prior to vaccination. However, no study has previously investigated differences in vulnerability using prospectively collected self-reported measures of vulnerability. The objective of this study therefore was to describe the distribution of biological and psychosocial indicators of vulnerability in girls referred to a hospital setting due to suspected adverse events and compare it with a sample of non-referred HPV vaccinated girls The study was conducted as a case control study based within the Danish National Birth Cohort. Cases were defined as HPV vaccinated girls referred to a hospital setting between 2015 and 2017 due to suspected adverse events (n = 80), and 5 controls were randomly selected from the remaining source population, matched to cases on age at vaccination, region of residence and year of vaccination. The final study population consisted of 480 girls. Prior exposures were based on information gathered from an 11 year follow up of the DNBC and included information on self-rated health, frequent health complaints, medication use, bullying, stressful life events and physical activity. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between each exposure and referral. The percentage of individuals in the exposed category of each exposure was generally higher for cases than controls. Particularly, the odds of being referred were higher for those with low self-rated health compared to high (OR [95%-CI] 2.43 [1.07-5.5]1), those being bullied (OR 3.19 [1.17-8.73]), and those who had taken medication (OR 2.22 [1.32-3.67]). Overall, these results indicated that girls experiencing suspected AE following HPV vaccination were more vulnerable prior to vaccination. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A microplan, an integrated set of detailed planning components, can be used to identify this information to support programs such as equitable vaccination efforts. Here, we presents a series of steps necessary to create an artificial intelligence-based framework for automated microplanning, and our pilot implementation of this analysis tool across 29 countries of the Americas. Further, we describe our processes for generating a conceptual framework, creating customized catchment areas, and estimating up-todate populations to support microplanning for health campaigns. Through our application of the present framework, we found that 68 million individuals across the 29 countries are within 5 km of a health facility. The number of health facilities analyzed ranged from 2 in Peru to 789 in Argentina, while the total population within 5 km ranged from 1,233 in Peru to 15,304,439 in Mexico. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using this methodological framework to support the development of customized micro plans for health campaigns using open-source data in multiple countries. The pandemic is demanding an improved capacity to generate successful, efficient immunization campaigns; we believe that the steps described here can increase the automation of microplans in low resource settings.

However, herd effects can be unmasked using a 'fried egg' approach whereby the analysis, restricted to the innermost households of clusters, 'yolk', creates an insulating 'egg-white' periphery. This approach has been demonstrated to unmask vaccine herd protection in reanalyses of cholera and typhoid vaccine CRTs. We applied this approach to an earlier CRT in Bangladesh of rotavirus vaccine (RV) whose overall analysis had failed to detect herd protection. Herein we present the results of this analysis. Methods: In the study area, infants in 142 villages were randomized to receive two doses of RV with routine EPI vaccines (RV villages) or only EPI vaccines (non-RV villages). We analyzed RV protection against acute rotavirus diarrhoea for the entire cluster (P100) and P75, P50, P25 clusters, representing 75%, 50% and 25% of the innermost households for each cluster, respectively. Results: During 2 years of follow-up, there was evidence of 27% overall (95 %CI: 7, 43) and 42% total protection (95 %CI: 23, 56) in the P100 cluster, but it did not increase when moved in smaller yolks. There was no evidence of indirect vaccine protection in the yolks at any cluster size. Conclusion: Our reanalysis of the CRT using the fried-egg approach did not detect RV herd protection. Whether these findings reflect a true inability of the RV to confer herd protection in this setting, or are due to limitations of the approach, requires further study. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Estimating Bordetella pertussis seroprevalence in adolescents and young adults in Mexico using the 2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT)	VACCINE			English	Article						Pertussis; Seroprevalence; Mexico; ENSANUT; Adolescents	ANTIBODIES; DIAGNOSIS; ASSAYS	Background: Low vaccination rates and under-detection of pertussis infections in adolescents and young adults have an impact on the transmission of pertussis to infants. In this study, the proportion of adolescents and young adults with IgG antibodies against B. pertussis antigens, representing recent infection or vaccination, was estimated in a population-based probabilistic survey in Mexico. Methods: Sera and data from 1,581 subjects, including 1,102 adolescents and 479 young adults (10-19 and 20-25 years old, respectively) randomly selected from Mexico's 2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey, were analyzed. IgG antibodies against pertussis toxin (PT) were measured with the CDC/FDA ELISA. A subset of 234 samples was additionally tested with Bp-IgG PT ELISA kit (EUROIMMUN AG, Lubeck, Germany). Threshold values from corresponding test kits were used to identify recent infection or vaccination. Results: Overall anti-PT IgG seroprevalence was 3.9% (95% CI: 2.3-6.3); 3.1% (95% CI: 1.9-5.0) in adolescents, and 4.9% (95% CI: 2.2-11) in young adults. Seroprevalence did not significantly vary by sex, socioeconomic status, region or rural/urban location. Compared to the CDC/FDA ELISA, the EUROIMMUN test showed a 76% sensitivity and 88% specificity. The weighted estimates represent a considerable burden of recent infection in adolescents and young adults; however, most adolescents and adults were seronegative and, therefore, susceptible to pertussis infection. Conclusion: Since booster vaccination to B. pertussis after toddlerhood is not recommended in the Mexican national policy, anti-PT IgG seropositivity may be reasonably attributed to recent infection. Assessing pertussis seroprevalence requires careful consideration of the diagnostic test threshold interpretation and epidemiological model used. (c) 2021 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A.

Methods: This open-labeled, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in two parts: Part A (a first-in-human study in Australian adults) and Part B (ascending dose and descending age in South African adults, toddlers and infants). In Part A, two cohorts of 10 adults were assigned to receive a single intramuscular injection of 1 of 2 escalating dose levels of the rotavirus VLP (Ro-VLP) vaccine (7 mu g or 21 mu g) or placebo. In Part B, one cohort of 10 adults was assigned to receive a single injection of the Ro-VLP vaccine (21 mu g) or placebo, two cohorts of 10 toddlers were assigned to receive 2 injections of 1 of 2 escalating dose levels of the Ro-VLP vaccine (7 mu g or 21 mu g) or placebo 28 days apart, and three cohorts of 20 infants were assigned to receive 3 injections of 1 of 3 escalating dose levels of the RoVLP vaccine (2.5 mu g, 7 mu g or 21 mu g) or placebo or 2 doses of oral Rotarix 28 days apart. Safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity were assessed. Results: There were no safety or tolerability concerns after administration of the Ro-VLP vaccine. The RoVLP vaccine induced an anti-G1P[8] IgG response in infants 4 weeks after the second and third doses. Neutralizing antibody responses against homologous G1P[8] rotavirus were higher in all Ro-VLP infant groups than in the placebo group 4 weeks after the third dose. No heterotypic immunity was elicited by the Ro-VLP vaccine. Conclusions: The Ro-VLP vaccine was well tolerated and induced a homotypic immune response in infants, suggesting that this technology platform is a favorable approach for a parenteral non replicating rotavirus vaccine.

Single-vial filovirus glycoprotein vaccines: Biophysical characteristics and immunogenicity after co-lyophilization with adjuvant	VACCINE			English	Article						Co-lyophilization; Emulsion adjuvant; Glycoprotein subunit vaccine; Formulation development	ACID SULFATE ESTERS; FORMULATION; STABILITY; STABILIZATION; EMULSION; TUBERCULOSIS; PROTEIN; DESIGN; IMPACT; EBOLA	Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), and Marburg marburgvirus (MARV) are the most prevalent and pathogenic species of filovirus. Previously, we showed that glycoprotein antigens from each virus could be lyophilized to create thermostable monovalent subunit vaccines. However, cross protection is not expected from the monovalent vaccines and therefore developing a trivalent filovirus vaccine would be desirable. Subunit protein vaccines often require the addition of an adjuvant to sufficiently boost the immunogenicity. Typically, liquid suspensions or emulsions of adjuvants and lyophilized antigens are stored in separate vials to avoid destabilizing interactions and are only mixed immediately before administration. Herein, we describe the development and characterization of monovalent and trivalent filovirus vaccines that are co-lyophilized with a squalane-in-water emulsion adjuvant. We found that the single-vial presentation retained adjuvant particle diameter and zeta potential after lyophilization and reconstitution. Furthermore, the trivalent vaccines elicited high antibody levels against all three antigens in mice and non-human primates. These results advance the prospect of developing a single-vial trivalent filovirus vaccine, which would enable easier distribution and administration of the vaccine to resource-poor areas.

Vaccines reduce PCV2 disease by inducing humoral immunity (neutralizing antibodies) and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) but may be improved by optimizing the immune response they induce. This study evaluated immune responses to a trivalent inactivated Porcine Circovirus (PCV) Type 1-Type 2a chimera (cPCV2a), cPCV2b and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (MH) (an experimental serial of Fostera (R) Gold PCV MH, also marketed as Circomax (R) Myco) vaccine or a bivalent recombinant PCV2a baculovirus expressed ORF2 capsid plus MH vaccine (Circumvent (R) PCV-M G2). Treatment Groups (T) received two doses of placebo (T01), one full or two split doses of the trivalent vaccine (T02, T03) or two split doses of the bivalent vaccine (T04) where two doses were given, there was a three-week period between administrations. All pigs were challenged with a virulent field isolate of PCV2d. CMI was measured as PCV2-specific IFN-gamma secreting cells in blood and lymph node. Humoral immunity was measured as PCV2 antibodies. Vaccine efficacy was determined as viremia and fecal shedding of virus. There was a robust antibody response in T02 and T04 post the second vaccination and all vaccinated groups post challenge. There was a robust PCV2-specific IFN-gamma response following the 1st dose in T02 and T03 and after the second dose in T02. T04 induced a low but detectable PCV2-specific IFN-gamma response only after the 2nd dose. Among lymph node cells (study day 52), there was a significantly higher PCV2-specific, IFN-gamma response to replicase and PCV2d capsid peptides in T01, consistent with active viral replication in non-vaccinated pigs. The trivalent chimeric vaccine induced robust CMI and protective efficacy, following a one dose regimen or splitting the dose into two vaccine administrations. (C) 2021 The Authors.

As such, a framework to recommend vaccines and build robust platforms to deliver them to protect the rapidly expanding demographic of older adults is needed. Adult immunization as a strategy has the broad potential to preserve and improve medical, social, and economic outcomes, including maintaining functional ability that benefits older adults, their families, communities, and countries. While we will soon have multiple vaccines against COVID-19, we must recognize that we already have a variety of vaccines against other pathogens that can keep adults healthier. They can prevent simultaneous co-infection with COVID-19, and may favorably impact- the outcome of a COVID-19 illness. Further, administering a vaccine against COVID-19 requires planning now to determine delivery strategies impacting how older adults will be immunized in a timely manner. A group of international experts with various backgrounds from health and aging disciplines met to discuss the evidence case for adult immunization and crucial knowledge gaps that must be filled in order to implement effective policies and programs for older adult immunization. This group, coming together as the International Council on Adult Immunization (ICAI), outlined a high-level roadmap to catalyze action, provide policy guidance, and envision a global adult immunization platform that can be adapted by countries to fit their local contexts. Further meetings centered around the value of adult immunization, particularly in the context of COVID-19. There was agreement that programs to deliver existing influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster vaccines, and future COVID-19 vaccines to over a billion older adults who are at substantially higher risk of death and disability due to vaccinepreventable diseases are more urgent than ever before. Here we present a proposed framework for delivering routine and pandemic vaccines. We call upon the global community and governments to prioritize action for integrating robust adult immunization programs into the public health agenda.

The PAPILLON study investigated the annual age-specific vaccination initiation rates and cumulative partial and complete vaccination rates in France from 2017 to 2022. It also identified the factors associated with vaccination in different age groups and those associated with the type of completion of the vaccination scheme (partial vs full vaccination). Methods: For this publication, all females recorded in the French National Claims database who initiated HPV vaccination between 1 July 2007 and 31 December 2018 and were aged between 11 and 19 years at initiation were included. Annual HPV vaccination initiation rates were estimated in 11-to 14-year-old (target population) and 15-to 19-year-old females (catch-up). Cumulative vaccine coverage rates (VCRs) were estimated among those who were 15, 16, 20 and 21 years old. Partial vaccination was defined by dispensing of at least one dose of HPV vaccine by the pharmacy, while full vaccination was defined by two or three doses dispensed by a pharmacy over an 18-month period, according to current French recommendations based on the age at vaccination initiation. Results: Among the 465,629 females who initiated HPV vaccination in 2017 or 2018, the initiation rate increased from 7.7 to 11.1% in 11-to 14-year-old girls and from 4.5 to 6.5% in 15-to 19-year-old females. In 2017 and 2018, the cumulative VCRs for partial vaccination by age 15 were 28.2% and 32.8%, respectively, while by age 20, they were 41.6% and 38.8%. The cumulative VCRs for full vaccination were 15.6% and 18.6% by age 16, while they were 25.9 and 23.6% by age 20. HPV vaccination initiation and completion were strongly associated with the use of health services. Conclusion: Overall, the HPV VCR substantively increased between 2017 and 2018, which is positive evidence of the resumption of vaccination. Updates in 2022 should confirm these results.

Currently, the main measures available to reduce the incidence of this disease are drug treatment and vector control. Traditionally, the development of vaccines occurs mainly through the use of antigenic candidates of the etiologic agent in the form of a vaccine preparation. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are structures analogous to viral capsids composed essentially of structural proteins and are widely used in vaccination protocols because of their immunostimulatory properties. In this context, the objective of this study was to use strategies in a murine immunization model to characterize the immunostimulatory capacity of VLPs from Triatoma virus (TrV-VLPs), analysed in the presence or absence of the aluminium vaccine adjuvant. In parallel, to characterize the immunogenic behaviour of four T. cruzi chimeric recombinant proteins (mix-IBMP) associated with TrV-VLPs or aluminium vaccine adjuvant. Method: We immunized BALB/c mice once or twice, depending on the strategy, and collected serum samples at 15, 30 and 45 days after the immunization. Subsequently, serum samples from animals immunized with TrV-VLPs were used to determine total IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 anti-TrV-VLPs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Data obtained demonstrate the ability of TrV-VLPs to preferably induce IgG2b and IgG3 type antibodies in the absence of aluminium adjuvant. In fact, the use of aluminium did not interfere with the total IgG profile of anti-TrV-VLPs. Interestingly, mix-IBMP had a better profile of total IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses when mixed with TrV-VLPs. Conclusion: In conclusion, these results suggest the potential of TrV-VLPs as a vaccine adjuvant and the use of T. cruzi chimeric antigens as a rational strategy for the development of vaccines against the experimental model of Chagas disease.

Syndromic surveillance of vaccine-associated adverse events in US emergency departments	VACCINE			English	Article						Public health; Immunisation safety; Vaccine adverse events; Emergency department; Emergency medicine; Surveillance	UNITED-STATES; COVERAGE; DECLINE	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explored use of emergency department (ED) visit data, during 2018-2020, from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program to monitor vaccine-associated adverse events (VAE) among all age groups. A combination of chief complaint terms and administrative diagnosis codes were used to detect VAE-related ED visits. Postvaccination fever was among the top 10 most frequently noted diagnoses. VAE annual trends demonstrated seasonality; visits trended upward starting in September of each year, coinciding with the administration of seasonal influenza vaccines. The 2020 VAE-related visit trend declined below the 2018 and 2019 baselines during March 22- September 5, 2020, before returning to the seasonal pattern. VAE-related visits declined in children aged 3-18 years in 2020 compared with 2018-2019, especially in the back-to-school months. These findings demonstrate that syndromic surveillance can complement traditional VAE reporting systems without an additional demand on data collection resources. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Huge efforts were undertaken to bring the COVID-19 vaccines in clinical development, so that it can be made available at the earliest, if found to be efficacious in the trials. We developed a candidate vaccine ZyCoV-D comprising of a DNA plasmid vector carrying the gene encoding the spike protein (S) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The S protein of the virus includes the receptor binding domain (RBD), responsible for binding to the human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor. The DNA plasmid construct was transformed into E. coli cells for large scale production. The immunogenicity potential of the plasmid DNA has been evaluated in mice, guinea pig, and rabbit models by intradermal route at 25, 100 and 500 tig dose. Based on the animal studies proof-of-concept has been established and preclinical toxicology (PCT) studies were conducted in rat and rabbit model. Preliminary animal study demonstrates that the candidate DNA vaccine induces antibody response including neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and also elicited Th-1 response as evidenced by elevated IFN-gamma levels.

Vaccination is likely to remain the most effective and user-friendly public health measure to counter this threat in the foreseeable future. The commercially available AVA BioThrax vac-cine has a number of shortcomings where improvement would lead to a more practical and effective vac-cine for use in the case of an exposure event. Identification of more effective adjuvants and novel delivery platforms is necessary to improve not only the effectiveness of the anthrax vaccine, but also enhance its shelf stability and ease-of-use. Polyanhydride particles have proven to be an effective platform at adju-vanting the vaccine-associated adaptive immune response as well as enhancing stability of encapsulated antigens. Another class of adjuvants, the STING pathway-targeting cyclic dinucleotides, have proven to be uniquely effective at inducing a beneficial inflammatory response that leads to the rapid induction of high titer antibodies post-vaccination capable of providing protection against bacterial pathogens. In this work, we evaluate the individual contributions of cyclic di-GMP (CDG), polyanhydride nanoparticles, and a combination thereof towards inducing neutralizing antibody (nAb) against the secreted protective antigen (PA) from B. anthracis. Our results show that the combination nanovaccine elicited rapid, high titer, and neutralizing IgG anti-PA antibody following single dose immunization that persisted for at least 108 DPI.

PCV10 elicits Protein D IgG responses in Papua New Guinean children but has no impact on NTHi carriage in the first two years of life	VACCINE			English	Article						Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae; NTHi; Carriage density; Protein D; Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; Papua New Guinea	NONTYPABLE HAEMOPHILUS-INFLUENZAE; D-CONJUGATE VACCINE; UPPER RESPIRATORY-TRACT; ACUTE OTITIS-MEDIA; STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE; NASOPHARYNGEAL CARRIAGE; PNEUMOCOCCAL CONJUGATE; NONABORIGINAL CHILDREN; BACTERIAL-COLONIZATION; SEMIARID AREA	Background: Nasopharyngeal colonisation with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is associated with development of infections including pneumonia and otitis media. The 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) uses NTHi Protein D (PD) as a carrier. Papua New Guinean children have exceptionally early and dense NTHi carriage, and high rates of NTHi-associated disease. Vaccination with PCV10 could potentially reduce NTHi carriage and disease in this population by inducing a NTHi PD immune response. Methods: Serum and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 101 Papua New Guinean children at 1, 4, 9, 10, 23 and 24 months of age. Children received PCV10 (n = 55) or PCV13 (not containing NTHi PD) (n = 46) at 1, 2 and 3 months of age. NTHi carriage density was measured in swabs by qPCR. Serum PD-IgG levels were measured by bead-based immunoassay. Results: Papua New Guinean children did naturally develop PD-IgG antibodies whose levels were increased at 4 months of age with PCV10 vaccination at 1-2-3 months. Despite this, most children were colonised with NTHi by 4 months of age (similar to 95%) regardless of being vaccinated with PCV10 or PCV13, and PCV10 had no impact on NTHi carriage density. Conclusion: Early vaccination of infants with PCV10 elicited a robust PD antibody response but this had no impact on NTHi carriage. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated the seroprevalence, vaccination rates, and barriers to vaccination among newly employed nurses and doctors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at a university hospital in the Republic of Korea from 2017 to 2020. The immune status for hepatitis B virus (HBV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and hepatitis A virus (HAV) was tested. HBV, VZV, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccinations were mandatory. HAV and tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) vaccinations were also recommended by specialists. A web based survey on factors affecting vaccination completion was conducted. Results: For the 668 participants, the mean age was 26 +/- 2 (+/- SD) years. Seroprevalence was 86% for HBV, 93% for VZV, and 59% for HAV. Vaccine completion rates were 40% for HBV, 70% for VZV, 65% for MMR, 42% for HAV, and 70% for Tdap. Overall compliance for mandatory vaccines was 54%. A total of 402 subjects who had worked for over one year were surveyed, with a 22% response rate. More than 50% of respondents gave the following reasons for not receiving recommend vaccines: 1) they were busy (77%), 2) vaccination process was complicated (68%), and 3) they simply forgot about vaccination (55%). Healthcare personnel agreed to be frequently informed of immunization requirements and for monitoring of vaccination rates. Conclusion: Vaccination compliance among newly employed doctors and nurses was 54%.

In October 2020, the Japanese law on immunization was revised, which resulted in a few laudable achievements. First, rotavirus vaccines were added to the NIP, 10 years after their introduction, and noteworthy studies of vaccine effectiveness and the incidence of intussusception in Japanese children were published. Second, rules on vaccine intervals-which had been a longstanding concern-were withdrawn. In addition to this revision of the law, the Japanese version of the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) was released by the Japan Pediatric Society in 2018. The VIS provides useful caregiver information on general immunization concepts and individual vaccines. Further challenges for the Japanese immunization program include (1) administering a booster dose of pertussis-containing vaccine to preschool children or teenagers, (2) reestablishing the active recommendation for human papilloma virus vaccines, (3) adding the mumps and influenza vaccines to the NIP, and (4) ensuring optimal dosing of seasonal influenza vaccines. During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, vaccination rates among children have been decreasing in many countries. In Japan, vaccination rates have been stable in infants, but declining among toddlers and school-aged children, despite public awareness of the need for timely administration of vaccines during the pandemic. Clearly, further action is needed if we are to adequately protect children living in Japan from vaccine-preventable diseases. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study aimed to analyze Twitter content related to the event to determine (1) characteristics of the Twitter users who authored these tweets, (2) the proportion of tweets expressing pro-vaccine compared to anti-vaccine sentiment, and (3) the content of these tweets. Methods: Data were collected using Twitter's Filtered Streams Interface, and included all publicly available tweets with the "#DoctorsSpeakUp" hashtag on March 5, 2020, the day of the event. Two independent coders assessed a 5% subsample of original tweets (n = 966) using a thematic content analysis approach. Cohen's kappa ranged 0.71-1.00 for all categories. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to examine associations between tweet sentiment, type of account, and tweet content (personal narrative and/or statement about research or science). Accounts were analyzed for likelihood of being a bot (i.e. automated account) using Botometer. Results: Of 847 (87.7%) relevant tweets, 244 (28.8%) were authored by a Twitter user that identified as a parent and 68 (8.0%) by a user that identified as a health professional. With regard to sentiment, 167 (19.7%) were coded as pro-vaccine and 668 (78.9%) were coded as anti-vaccine. Tweet sentiment was significantly associated with type of account (p < 0.001) and tweet content (p = 0.001). Of the 575 unique users in our dataset, 31 (5.4%) were classified as bots using Botometer. Conclusions: Our results suggest a highly coordinated response of devoted anti-vaccine antagonists in response to the #DoctorsSpeakUp event. These findings can be used to help vaccine advocates leverage social media more effectively to promote vaccines. Specifically, it would be valuable to ensure that pro-vaccine messages consider hashtag use and pre-develop messages that can be launched and promoted by pro-vaccine advocates. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Having safe and efficacious vaccines available is only half the equation; people must also take them. We describe a study to identify COVID-19 vaccine attitudes, values and intentions immediately preceding authorization of COVID-19 vaccines in the US. Methods: A national panel survey was conducted to measure intent to receive COVID-19 vaccines as well as disease and vaccine attitudes, values and trust in local, state and federal public health authorities. Results: Greater than 80% of respondents reported confidence they could adhere to COVID recommendations such as mask wearing, social distancing and hand washing. The majority of respondents (70%) reported believing that current drugs were somewhat or very good at treating COVID-19 infection. Vaccine intent fell into three groups: Intenders (50%), Wait and Learn (40%), and Unlikelys (10%). Intent to get vaccinated was substantially lower among African American (32%), and higher among men (56%), those over 60 years of age (61%), those with a Bachelor's degree or higher (63%), and Democrats (63%). The Wait and Learn group, compared to the Intenders, were less likely to report being diagnosed with a high risk condition for COVID-19, receiving an influenza vaccine in the past 12 months, discussing COVID-19 vaccine with their healthcare provider, perceiving COVID-19 as severe, considering a COVID19 vaccine important to stop the spread of infection, and wering a mask usually or almost always. Conclusion: Only half of US adults intend to accept COVID-19 vaccines; most others (40%) are uncertain. Levels of immunity associated with community protection will not be achieved without reaching those who are currently uncertain. Characterizing COVID-19 vaccine attitudes and intentions and ascertaining values and trust in local, state, and federal public health authorities that impact vaccine decision-making are essential.

Increased presenteeism, decreased absenteeism, and low uptake of the influenza vaccine can contribute to the spread of influenza among HCP in healthcare settings. We used a mixed methods approach to investigate attitudes and behaviors of HCP in Israel towards influenza vaccination, presenteeism, and absenteeism. Methods: The study took place over three influenza seasons (2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019) at the largest hospital in southern Israel. We administered a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) questionnaire and conducted semi-structured interviews with HCP who had been recently ill with respiratory symptoms. The KAP questionnaire included closed-ended questions about attitudes and behaviors regarding influenza, working while sick, and influenza vaccination. The interviews investigated HCP's perceptions of influenza infection and attitudes about absenteeism, presenteeism, and the influenza vaccine. Results: We conducted 74 semi-structured interviews over three influenza seasons. Four HCP were interviewed twice, in separate seasons for different illness episodes. The 70 individuals interviewed included 16 physicians, 45 nurses or technicians, and 9 administrative staff. The median age was 42.5 years (range: 2560), and most (79%) were female. Half (50%) got vaccinated against influenza before their illness episode. In interviews, most HCP said they come to work while sick (presenteeism) due to a strong personal work ethic and an institutional culture that discourages taking sick leave (absenteeism). HCP expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine as well as concern that the influenza vaccine causes severe illness. Discussion: Over three influenza seasons in Israel, HCP cited a number of reasons for working while sick, and doubted the usefulness of influenza vaccine. Addressing reasons for presenteeism and vaccine hesitancy among HCP is crucial to protect HCP and patients from influenza virus infection and other viral respiratory illnesses, such as COVID-19.

A vaccine administered by nasal delivery is endowed with such characteristics against respiratory viruses. In this study, we generated a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-based subunit vaccine. Mice were immunized via intranasal inoculation, microneedle-intradermal injection, or intramuscular injection, after which the RBD-specific immune responses were compared. Results showed that when administrated intranasally, the vaccine elicited a robust systemic humoral immunity with high titers of IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies as well as a significant mucosal immunity. Besides, antigen-specific T cell responses were also analyzed. These results indicated that the non-invasive intranasal administration should be explored for the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design.

The N-terminal sequence of the protein defines the more than 200 M types of Strep A and also contains epitopes that elicit opsonic antibodies, some of which cross-react with heterologous M types. Current efforts to develop broadly protective M protein-based vaccines are directed at identifying potential cross-protective epitopes located in the N-terminal regions of cluster-related M proteins for use as vaccine antigens. In this study, we have used a comprehensive approach using the recurrent neural network ABCpred and IEDB epitope conservancy analysis tools to predict 16 residue linear B-cell epitopes from 117 clinically relevant M types of Strep A (similar to 88% of global Strep A infections). To examine the immunogenicity of these epitope-based vaccines, nine peptides that together shared similar to 60% sequence identity with 37 heterologous M proteins were incorporated into two recombinant hybrid protein vaccines, in which the epitopes were repeated 2 or 3 times, respectively. The combined immune responses of immunized rabbits showed that the vaccines elicited significant levels of antibodies against all nine vaccine epitopes present in homologous N-terminal 1-50 amino acid synthetic M peptides, as well as cross-reactive antibodies against 16 of 37 heterologous M peptides predicted to contain similar epitopes. The epitopespecificity of the cross-reactive antibodies was confirmed by ELISA inhibition assays and functional opsonic activity was assayed in HL-60-based bactericidal assays. The results provide important information for the future design of broadly protective M protein-based Strep A vaccines. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Population growth and increasing life expectancies call for effective healthy aging strategies inclusive of immunization to reduce the burden of vaccinepreventable diseases, improve quality of life, and mitigate antimicrobial resistance. Based on a review of available literature on the pneumococcal disease, influenza, and herpes zoster epidemiology and economic burden, and the health systems and policy barriers for adult immunization, we identified evidence gaps and considerations for prioritizing adult immunization. The body of evidence for adult immunization and the health and economic burden of adult disease is heavily concentrated in high-income countries. The few countries reporting adult immunization policies generally focus on high-risk groups. Despite robust child immunization programs in most countries, adult immunization programs and policies lag far behind and there is a general lack of appropriate delivery platforms. Global adult disease burden and economic costs are substantial but evidence from low- and middle-income countries is limited. There is a need for a strengthened evidence base and political commitment to drive a comprehensive, global technical consensus on adult immunization. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a way of contagion for patients, vaccination coverage among them is low. Mandatory vaccination has been proposed, but controversies remain. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the acceptance of mandatory vaccination by HCWs, and to investigate associated characteristics. MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Psyclnfo, CINAHL and Web of Science were used to search for studies assessing the topic. PRISMA statements were followed. Of the 13,457 univocal records found, 52 studies were included in the systematic review and 40 in the meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of HCWs accepting the policy was of 61% (95% CI: 53%- 68%) but with great heterogeneity between continents (from 54% in Europe to 69% in Asia) and in different professionals (from 40% in nurses to 80% in students). Vaccinated HCWs agreed more frequently with mandatory vaccination than non-vaccinated ones. More studies that consider mandatory vaccination acceptance as the main outcome are needed, but the results of this study confirm that in some settings the majority of HCWs favour mandatory vaccination. This, combined with effects that a flu epidemic could have if overlapped to pandemics with similar symptoms, requires renewed considerations on mandatory vaccination. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Effectiveness of quadrivalent influenza vaccination in the first year of a funded childhood program in Queensland, Australia, 2018	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza; Influenza vaccine; Vaccine effectiveness; Children; Australia	CHILDREN; HOSPITALIZATION	Background: Following high influenza activity in 2017, the state of Queensland, Australia, funded a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccination program for children aged 6 months to <5 years in 2018. We calculated influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) among children eligible for this program. Methods: A matched case-control study was conducted. Cases were identified using Queensland 2018 influenza notification data among children age-eligible for funded vaccination. Controls were drawn from Australian Immunisation Register records of Queensland resident children age-eligible for funded influenza vaccine. Up to 10 controls per case were matched for location and birthdate. First dose vaccination was valid if received >= 14 days prior to specimen collection; a second dose was valid if received >= 28 days after first dose receipt. VE was calculated for vaccine doses and adherence to national recommendations for two doses in the first season (schedule completeness) and adjusted (VEadj) for sex and First Nations status. Results: There were 1,125 cases and 10,645 matched controls analysed. Overall VEadj against laboratory-confirmed influenza was 51% (95% confidence interval (CI) 41-60). VEadj was 60% (95% CI 46-70) for children who received two doses in 2018, and 60% (95% CI 48-69) for children vaccinated appropriately according to schedule completeness. VE increased with age. Conclusions: Moderate vaccine effectiveness was observed for children eligible for the funded program in Queensland in 2018, adding to the sparse evidence for influenza vaccine use in Australian children. Adhering to the national first season two dose schedule for influenza vaccine receipt in children ensures maximum protection. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Safety of maternal pertussis vaccination on pregnancy and birth outcomes: A prospective cohort study	VACCINE			English	Article						Maternal vaccination; Pertussis; Tdap; Safety; Pregnant women; Infants	IMMUNIZATION; INFLUENZA; VACCINES; INFANTS; POWER; RISK; FORM	Objective: To evaluate the safety of maternal pertussis vaccination on pregnancy and birth outcomes. Methods: The study population comprised 1272 healthy nulliparous pregnant women who participated in Screening Tests to identify poor Outcomes in Pregnancy (STOP) study at two obstetric hospitals in South Australia between 2015 and 2018. Participants were followed prospectively, with vaccination (confirmed by medical records), extensive amounts of pregnancy and birth outcome data collected by research midwives. Adjusted relative risks (aRRs) and hazard ratios (aHRs) were estimated accounting for time-varying vaccine exposure and the temporal nature of each outcome. Results: Of the 1272 women included in this study, 80.1% (n = 1019) received maternal pertussis vaccination. Vaccinated women had an average 0.22 weeks (95% CI 0.001, 0.44) longer gestation at delivery compared to unvaccinated women. Maternal pertussis vaccination was not associated with chorioam-nionitis (aRR 0.71, 95% CI 0.27,1.82), gestational hypertension (aHR 1.24, 95% CI, 0.66, 2.30), preeclampsia (aHR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47, 1.18) nor preterm birth (aHR 0.99, 95% CI 0.47, 2.07). Neither risk of low birth weight (aHR 0.72, 95% CI 0.41, 1.27) nor small for gestational age infants (aHR 0.67,95% CI 0.29, 1.55) were increased following maternal pertussis vaccination. No associations between pertussis vaccination during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes including admission to the neonatal care unit, low Apgar scores, and mechanical ventilation were observed. Results were not materially changed after adjustment for maternal influenza vaccination. Conclusion: Our study provides reassuring evidence of the safety of maternal pertussis vaccination with no increased risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. These findings support recommendations for pertussis vaccination during pregnancy to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with early-infant pertussis disease. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was designed to offer RZV to placebo recipients of these parent studies. Methods: Vaccine safety and suspected HZ episode occurrence were assessed for 12 months following vaccination. Results: Of the 14,550 eligible participants, 8687 received RZV and 97.8% completed the 2-dose schedule. During the 30-day post-vaccination period, 5175 (59.6%) participants experienced >= 1 unsolicited adverse event (AE), 4422 (50.9%) were vaccination-related. The most common AEs were injection-site reactions, pyrexia, and headache. During the study, 734 (8.4%) participants reported >= 1 serious AE (SAE) and 62 (0.7%) reported >= 1 potential immune-mediated disease (pIMD); 2 of each were assessed as vaccination-related. Suspected HZ episodes were reported by 30 participants (0.3%). Conclusions: Nature and incidence of AEs, SAES, and pIMDs were as expected and in line with the parent studies.

Cases were identified and characterized through surveillance and health record review. All five available isolates were characterized using whole genome sequencing; four isolates (from MenB-4C recipients) were further characterized using flow cytometry, MenB-4C-induced serum bactericidal activity (SBA), and genetic Meningococcal Antigen Typing System (gMATS). Three patients were at increased meningococcal disease risk because of an outbreak or underlying medical conditions, and only four of the six patients had completed a full 2-dose MenB series. Isolates were available from 5 patients, and all contained sub-family A FHbp. The four isolates from MenB-4C recipients expressed NhbA but were mismatched for the other MenB-4C vaccine antigens. These four isolates were relatively resistant to MenB-4C-induced SBA, but predicted by gMATS to be covered. Overall, patient risk factors, incomplete vaccine series completion, waning immunity, and strain resistance to SBA likely contributed to disease in these six patients. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Influence of rapid COVID-19 vaccine development on vaccine hesitancy	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine hesitancy; Secondary risk; Protection motivation; COVID-19 vaccine	FEAR APPEALS; MEDIA; INFORMATION; KNOWLEDGE; BELIEFS	Introduction: In the race to deploy vaccines to prevent COVID-19, there is a need to understand factors influencing vaccine hesitancy. Secondary risk theory is a useful framework to explain this, accounting for concerns about vaccine efficacy and safety. Methods: During the first week of July, 2020, participants (N = 216) evaluated one of three different hypothetical vaccine scenarios describing an FDA-approved vaccine becoming available "next week," "in one year," or "in two years." Dependent variables were perceived vaccine efficacy, self-efficacy, perceived vaccine risk, and vaccination willingness. Covariates included vaccine conspiracy beliefs, science pessimism, media dependency, and perceived COVID-19 risk. Data analysis employed multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). Results: Perceived vaccine efficacy was lowest for the next-week vaccine (eta 2p = .045). Self-efficacy was higher for the two-year vaccine than the next-week vaccine (eta 2p = .029). Perceived vaccine risk was higher for the next-week vaccine than for the one-year vaccine (eta 2p = .032). Vaccination willingness did not differ among experimental treatments. In addition, vaccine conspiracy beliefs were negatively related to perceived vaccine efficacy (eta 2p = .142), self-efficacy (eta 2p = .031), and vaccination willingness (eta 2p = .143) and positively related to perceived vaccine risk (eta 2p = .216). Conclusions: The rapid development of the COVID-19 vaccine may have heightened public concerns over efficacy, availability, and safety. However, the current findings showed a general willingness to take even the most rapidly developed vaccine. Nonetheless, there remains a need to communicate publicly and transparently about vaccine efficacy and safety and work to reduce vaccine conspiracy beliefs. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Mandatory immunization and vaccine injury support programs: A survey of 28 GNN countries	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine injury support program (VISP); Vaccine injury healthcare program (VIHP); Mandatory immunization; Vaccine injury compensation programs (VICP); Adverse events following immunization (AEFI)		Background: Despite the proposed ethical link between mandatory immunization and Vaccine Injury Support Programs (VISPs), relatively few jurisdictions, even those with mandatory immunization, have implemented such programs. Although it may be assumed that individuals injured by a vaccine in a non-VISP country receive less support than in countries possessing such programs, the extent of the dis-crepancy is not clear; nor is the nature of any discrepancy. Methods: In our 2018 survey of 28 Global NITAG (National Immunization Technical Advisory Group) Network (GNN) countries, we asked respondents about mandatory immunization and the availability of VISPs. Responses were supplemented with desktop research and review of scholarly literature for fur-ther information regarding VISP availability and details. Results: Although only two of 14 (14%) surveyed jurisdictions with mandatory immunization had formal VISPs, responses from additional countries suggested the presence of less formal avenues of compensa-tion for serious Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs); similarly, we found five of 15 (33%) of countries without mandatory immunization had implemented formal VISPs, but another three such countries suggested similar informal methods of compensation. Conclusions: From our data, it is evident that at least some countries with mandatory immunization may discharge their (perceived or actual) ethical obligation to provide financial assistance to vaccine-injured individuals through more informal avenues rather than structured VISPs, although the extent and impact of this practice is by its nature difficult to assess. Further, the nature of VISPs may vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and simple VISP/non-VISP classification of jurisdiction may fail to capture nuance in support for AEFI victims in many jurisdictions. Future assessments of VISPs should consider the possibility of these more informal avenues of support for vaccine injuries. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Harmon, Shawn H.

Natural infection does not result in long-term immu-nity, and there is no licensed vaccine. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a commonly used vaccine vector platform against infectious diseases, and has been used as a vector for a licensed Ebola vaccine. In this study, we expressed the RSV fusion (F) protein, the RSV F protein stabilized in either a pre-fusion or a post-fusion configuration, the attachment glycoprotein (G), or the G and F proteins of RSV in combination in a VSV vector. Cotton rats were immunized with these recombinants intranasally or subcutaneously to test immunogenicity. RSV F stabilized in either a pre-fusion or a post-fusion configuration proved to be poorly immunogenic and protective when compared to unmodified F. RSV G provided partial protection and moderate levels of neutralizing antibody production, both of which improved with intranasal admin-istration compared to subcutaneous inoculation. The most successful vaccine vector was VSV expressing both the G and F proteins after intranasal inoculation. Immunization with this recombinant induced neu-tralizing antibodies and provided protection from RSV challenge in the upper and lower respiratory tract for at least 80 days. Our results demonstrate that co-expression of F and G proteins in a VSV vector pro-vides synergistic effects in inducing RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies and protection against RSV infection.

The World Health Organization categories AEFI into two; serious and non-serious. An AEFI is considered serious if it is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or results in death. The measles vaccine is safe and effective however because it is a live-attenuated injectable vaccine it is more prone to AEFI as compared to non-injectable vaccines when given in large numbers over a short period as is the nature of measles mass vaccination campaigns (MVC). This article describes Nigeria's experience on AEFI reporting during the 2017/2018 Measles vaccination campaign (MVC). Methods: We reviewed various materials which included the Open Data Kit (ODK) which is an open source smartphone-based data collecting tool, operations room reports, measles campaign tally sheets, AEFI line listing forms, the post measles campaign coverage survey report and the report of the AEFI national expert committee review of the 2017/2018 Nigeria measles MVC. Results: A total of 6,214 suspected cases of AEFI were line listed from all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory(FCT) during the 2017/2018 MVC with Fever(38%) and pain at injection site the (30%)most common reports. Overall, 99.7% AEFIs were reported to be non-serious AEFIs, with almost all cases resolved fully with no long-term sequalae.. The national incidence of suspected AEFI per 100,000 population was 16.3 with subnational incidence highest in Kebbi state (101.3/100,000) and lowest in Bayelsa state (0.8/100,000). Conclusion: Adequate AEFI reporting, Investigation and management remains important in managing the risk of a disruption of mass campaigns. The deployment of supervisors during campaign may play an important role in improving the identification and reporting of suspected AEFI. Further inquiries about AEFIs during the post campaign coverage evaluation also played a role in improving AEFI reporting and documentation. The real-time, on the spot, follow up by the national operations team helped with decision making and intervention including AEFI investigations and assessments. (C) 2021 World Health Organization.

This study aimed to provide baseline information on epidemiology of rotavirus and circulating strains before rotavirus vaccine introduction in Myanmar. Methods: Hospital-based, prospective surveillance was conducted from May 2018 to January 2020 at four sentinel sites; two hospitals in Lower Myanmar, one hospital each in Middle Myanmar and East Myanmar. Children under five years of age hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis were enrolled; demographic and clinical data were collected. Stool samples were screened by ELISA (ProSpecT (TM) Rotavirus, OXOID-UK) for rotavirus antigen and a subset of ELISA positive samples were genotyped by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: Rotavirus was detected in 45.7% (799/1750) of cases enrolled at three sites in May 2018-April 2019 and 42.5% (521/1227) at four sites in May 2019-January 2020. RVGE cases were predominantly male (58.7%; 775/1320) and 92.6% (1223/1320) of RVGE cases occurred in <2 years old. Rotavirus detection was higher in the cold and dry season (November-April). RVGE compared to non-RVGE cases had more frequent vomiting (78.3% Vs 68.1%, p < 0.01), fever (65.8% Vs 61.3%, p = 0.01), severe dehydration (3.6% Vs 2.1%, p < 0.01) and requirement of treatment by IV fluid (58.3% Vs 53.1%, p < 0.01). The most prevalent genotypes identified were G1P[6] (113/359, 31.5%), G1P[8] (94/359, 26.2%) and G2P[4] (33/359, 9.2%). Conclusions: This study confirms the persistent high prevalence of RVGE among children under-five admitted to hospitals in different parts of Myanmar and the diversity of rotavirus strains over time prior to vaccine introduction. The rotavirus vaccine was introduced nationwide in February 2020 in Myanmar and these data will be important baseline data for post-vaccination monitoring of vaccine impact and circulating strains.

Hill tribe children in Thailand live in remote areas with underdeveloped education systems and low economic status. This study aimed to assess serocoverage under the EPI and access to vaccination clinics. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed to assess serocoverage after childhood vaccination among hill tribe children who lived in 34 selected villages in Chiang Rai Province, Thailand. A validated questionnaire was administered, and 3-mL blood specimens were collected. Antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), measles, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and tetanus were detected. Chi-square tests were performed to detect the different proportion of patients with antibodies with different characteristics. Results: Half of the hill tribe children aged 1-18 years did not have medical evidence (logbook) of immunization. More than 98.0% of the children who had medical evidence received the recommended immunizations. Only half of the children had anti-HBs (51.1%), and 22.3% had antibodies against JEV. The majority were found to be positive for antibodies against measles (83.3%) and tetanus (91.4%). Sex (p-value = 0.028), tribe (p-value < 0.001), age (p-value < 0.001), and parents' monthly income (p-value = 0.008) were associated with a lack of medical evidence.

Linked vaccination coverage surveys plus serosurveys among Ethiopian toddlers undertaken three years apart to compare coverage and serologic evidence of protection in districts implementing the RED-QI approach	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccination; Survey; Measles; Tetanus; Serosurvey; Seroprotection	IMMUNIZATION COVERAGE; TETANUS; PROGRAM; MEASLES; CHILDREN; IMMUNITY; IMPROVE; IMPACT; TOOL	In low and middle-income countries, estimating the proportion of vaccinated toddlers in a population is important for controlling vaccine-preventable diseases by identifying districts where immunization services need strengthening. Estimates measured before and several years after specific interventions can assess program performance. However, employing different methods to derive vaccination coverage estimates often yield differing results. Methods: Linked vaccination coverage surveys and seroprotection surveys performed among-300 toddlers 12-23 months of age in districts (woredas), one per region, of Ethiopia (total,-900 toddlers) in 2013 to estimate the proportion vaccinated with tetanus toxoid (a proxy for pentavalent vaccine) and measles vaccine. The surveys were followed by implementation of the Reaching Every District using Quality Improvement (RED-QI) approach to strengthen the immunization system. Linked coverage/serosurveys were repeated in 2016 to assess effects of the interventions on vaccination coverage. Indicators included "documented coverage" (vaccination card and/or health facility register records) and "crude coverage" (documented plus parent/caretaker recall for children without cards). Seroprotection thresholds were IgG-ELISA tetanus antitoxin >0.05 IU/ml and plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) measles titers >120 mIU/ml. Findings: Improved markers in 2016 over 2013 include coverage of pentavalent vaccination, vaccination timeliness, and fewer missed opportunities to vaccinate. In parallel, tetanus seroprotection increased in the 3 woredas from 59.6% to 79.1%, 72.9% to 83.7%, and 94.3 to 99.3%. In 2015, the Ethiopian government conducted supplemental measles mass vaccination campaigns in several regions including one that involved a project woreda and the campaign overlapped with the RED-QI intervention timeframe; protective measles PRN titers there rose from 31.0% to 50.0%. Interpretation: The prevalence of seroprotective titers of tetanus antitoxin (stimulated by tetanus toxoid components within pentavalent vaccine) provides a reliable biomarker to identify children who received pentavalent vaccine. In the three study woredas, the RED-QI intervention appeared to improve immunization service delivery, as documented by enhanced pentavalent vaccine coverage, vaccination timeliness, and fewer missed vaccination opportunities. A measles mass vaccination campaign was followed by a markedly increased prevalence of measles PRN antibodies. Collectively, these observations suggest that wider implementation of RED-QI can strengthen immunization, and periodic linked vaccination surveys/ serosurveys can monitor changes.

Novel TLR4 adjuvant elicits protection against homologous and heterologous Influenza A infection	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine; Influenza; Adjuvant; TLR4 agonist; Cross-protection	VACCINE; PURIFICATION; SHIFT	Influenza A virus (IAV) is a leading cause of respiratory disease worldwide often resulting in hospitaliza-tion or death. In this study, TLR4 immunostimulatory molecules, Bacterial Enzymatic Combinatorial Chemistry (BECC) 438 and BECC470 were found to be superior IAV vaccine adjuvants when compared to the classic adjuvant alhydrogel (alum) and Phosphorylated Hexa-Acyl Disaccharide (PHAD), a synthetic TLR4 agonist. BECC molecules allow for antigen sparing of a recombinant HA (rHA) protein, elicit a more balanced IgG1/IgG2a response, and were protective in a prime only dosing schedule. Importantly, BECC molecules afford protection from a heterologous IAV strain demonstrating that a cross-protective influ-enza vaccine is possible when the antigen is effectively adjuvanted.

J	Elas, M; Villatoro, N; Pezzoli, L				Elas, Miguel; Villatoro, Nora; Pezzoli, Lorenzo			Disproportionality analysis of reported drug adverse events to assess a potential safety signal for pentavalent vaccine in 2019 in El Salvador	VACCINE			English	Article						Febrile seizure; Pentavalent vaccine; Pharmacovigilance; Vaccine safety; Adverse events following immunization; El Salvador		Detection and surveillance of vaccine safety hazards is a public health staple. In the post-marketing phase, when vaccines are used in mass, it is crucial to monitor potential signals of adverse reactions that may have been missed in the pre-marketing phase. We analysed spontaneous reports of drug adverse events in El Salvador to assess a potential safety signal related to an increase in febrile seizures following the pentavalent (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae Type B) vaccine in 2019. This was a retrospective observational study of adverse event notifications in the national electronic drug safety database from 2011 to 2019. We performed standard disproportionality analysis computing Proportional Reporting Risk (PRR), Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Relative Reporting Ratio (RRR), Chi squared, and Information Component (IC), comparing the pairing of febrile seizures and pentavalent vaccine to all other drugs and adverse events recorded in 2019. The occurrence of febrile seizures following pentavalent vaccination exceeded the WHO expected rate of six cases x 100 000 doses administered from April 2019, with a maximum of 9.2 in September. IC was 4.3, ORR 421.9 (95% Confidence Interval, CI: 123.8-1437.7), PRR 223.5 (95 %CI: 70.2-710.9), RRR was 19.5. The first booster presented the highest rate (14.6 per 100,000 doses) of febrile seizures, more than double than expected. Rates for 2018 remained below expected. Reports of febrile seizures following pentavalent vaccine were also on the increase globally since 2014, with highest rates in 2018 and 2019. There was a disproportion of febrile seizures notifications following pentavalent in El Salvador in 2019, suggesting the existence of a safety signal. This may be due to the change in provider. Further studies should assess the causes of the increase and compute costs and benefits of this vaccination to determine if switching to a less reactogenic vaccine formulation is indicated.

Longitudinal assessment of nonavalent vaccine HPV types in a sample of sexually active African American women from ten US Cities	VACCINE			English	Article						Human papillomavirus; HPV Nonavalent vaccine; African-American; Women; Persistent infection; Revaccination	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION; ADULT WOMEN; PREVALENCE; INFECTION	Background: Chronic infection with high-risk human papillomavirus is a necessary cause for cervical carcinogenesis. This study examined prevalence of nonavalent vaccine preventable HPV types over four months among sexually active women in the United States. Methods: This sub-study obtained meta-data for 80 of the 1,365 women (18-25 years), enrolled in the BRAVO study, a randomized, open-label trial of home screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis at high-risk for sexually transmitted infections conducted between 2008 and 2013. Participants were randomized to treatment or standard-of-care, and followed every 2-months for 12 months. Stored vaginal swabs from the first three visits were tested for the nine vaccine preventable HPV types using quantitative PCR. Prevalence and associated 95% confidence intervals for the HPV types were assessed using R (version 3.6.1). Results: The average age of the participants was 21.5 (SD +/- 2.11) years, with 60% having ever been pregnant and all were African-American. Majority (71%) reported > two sex partners in the prior year with 89% having unprotected vaginal sex and 45% having a new sex partner in the prior year. About 30% had > one of the nine nonavalent vaccine HPV types at all three time points over a period of four months, 15% at two of any three visits, 19% at one of the three visits and 36% were negative for all nine vaccine HPV types at all time points. The most frequently detected HPV vaccine types were 52, 58, 16, and 18. The prevalence of any vaccine HPV types, and high-risk HPV types was 63.8% and 58.8%, respectively. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that HPV vaccination which is currently recommended for all unvaccinated persons through age 26 years, is likely to be more beneficial than previously thought as nonavalent HPV vaccine was not available during the time these data were collected.

Effect of cytomegalovirus infection on humoral immune responses to select vaccines administered during infancy	VACCINE			English	Article						Congenital CMV; Vaccine; Immune response; Immunisation; Africa	IMMUNOGENICITY	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in neonates has been associated with functional exhaustion of T-cells. We explored humoral immune responses from vaccination between congenital CMV-infected, postnatal CMV-infected and CMV-uninfected infants. Whole blood from infants with known CMV status was tested at seven months age, by in-house Luminex multiplex immunoassay, for antibodies to select vaccines in the primary series of childhood immunisations: Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis-Haemophilus Influenzae type b-Hepatitis B (DTaP-Hib-HBV). Immune responses to the primary series of DTaP-Hib-HBV vaccine was similar in congenital CMV-infected, postnatal CMV-infected and CMV-uninfected infants at seven months age. Close to 100% of congenital CMV-infected, postnatal CMV-infected and CMV-uninfected infants had antigen-specific IgG-concentrations above the correlate or surrogate of protection to four of five antigens (HBsAg, TT, DT, PT). This suggests CMV does not have any deleterious effect on humoral immune responses to the primary series of DTaP-Hib-HBV vaccination in black-African children. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Updated evidence synthesis of maternal-fetal outcomes is constantly needed to ensure that the risk-benefit of vaccination during pregnancy remains positive. Methods: An overview of systematic reviews (OoSRs) was performed. We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE for SRs including recommended vaccines for maternal immunization reporting the following: abortion, stillbirth, chorioamnionitis, congenital anomalies, microcephaly, neonatal death, neonatal infection, preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), maternal death and small for gestational age (SGA) from 2010 to April 2019. Quality and overlap of SRs was assessed. Results: Seventeen SRs were identified, eight of them included meta-analysis; quality was high in three SRs, moderate in six SRs, low in two SRs, and critically low in six SRs. Stillbirth and PTB were the most frequently reported outcomes by 15 and 13 SRs, respectively, followed by abortion (9 SRs), congenital anomalies (9 SRs), SGA (8 SRs), neonatal death (8 SRs), LBW (4 SRs), chorioamnionitis (3 SRs), maternal death (1 SR). SRs included mainly observational evidence for influenza and Tdap vaccines (11 SRs and 4 SRs, respectively); limited evidence was found for hepatitis (1 SR), yellow fever (1 SR), and meningococcal (1 SR) vaccines. Most of the SRs found no effect. Eight SRs found benefit/protection of influenza vaccine (for stillbirth, neonatal death, preterm birth, LBW), or Tdap vaccine (for preterm birth and SGA); one found a probable risk (chorioamnionitis/Tdap). The SRs for Hepatitis B, meningococcal and yellow fever vaccines were inconclusive. Conclusions: Definite risks were not identified for any vaccine and outcome; however better evidence is needed for all outcomes and vaccines. The available evidence in the SRs to support vaccine safety was based mainly on observational data. More RCTs with adequate reporting of maternal-fetal outcomes and larger high-quality observational studies are needed. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To reduce their high frequency vaccination-induced immune stress, we constructed a combined vaccine based on the E2 protein of CSFV and the S1 spike protein subunit of PEDV (named E2-S1). In mice, the E2-S1 vaccine elicited higher neutralizing antibody titers and IgG1/IgG2a ratios against CSFV and PEDV than those induced by individual E2 or S1 vaccines. Moreover, it elicited high IL-4 expression, but no IFN-gamma expression. The results suggest that good compatibility exists between E2 and S1 antigens, and the E2-S1 vaccine can elicit a strong Th2-type cell-mediated humoral immune response. The E2-S1 recombinant fusion protein provides a novel vaccine candidate against both CSFV and PEDV, laying the foundation for future combination vaccines against swine diseases.

Adapting the Motors of Influenza Vaccination Acceptance Scale into the Motors of COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale: Psychometric evaluation among mainland Chinese university students	VACCINE			English	Article						Confirmatory factor analysis; COVID-19; Psychometrics; Vaccine; Young adults	INTENTION; MODEL	Background: COVID-19 continues to ravage the world with economies and life significantly and negatively affected. Fortunately, there has been significant progress in the production of vaccines to stem the infection. However, with controversies and myths surrounding vaccinations, it is timely to examine individuals' willingness to vaccinate. The present study adapted the Motors of Influenza Vaccination Acceptance Scale (MoVac-Flu Scale) into the Motors of COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale (MoVac-COVID19S) for validation and assessed the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination utilizing the cognitive model of empowerment (CME). Methods: A total of 3145 university students (mean age = 20.80 years; SD = 2.09) were recruited for the present study between January 5 and 16, 2021. Two MoVac-COVID19S scales (9-item and 12-item) were adapted from the MoVac-Flu Scale, an instrument developed using CME. Psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain reliability and validity properties. Results: The findings indicated that the MoVac-COVID19S had high internal consistency in both the 9-item version (omega = 0.921) and 12-item version (omega = 0.898). The factor structure of the MoVac-COVID19S (9-item and 12-item versions) corresponded well with CME theory. All the fit indices were satisfactory (comparative fit index = 0.984, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.971, root mean square error of approximation = 0.088, standardized root mean square residual = 0.058) but the 9-item MoVac-COVID had better fit indices than the 12-item MoVac-COVID due to the negative wording effects existing in the 12-item MoVac-COVID19S. The scale had satisfactory known-group validity in both 9-item and 12-item versions. Conclusions: The MoVac-COVID19S has promising psychometric properties based on internal consistency, factor structure, and known-group validity. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Don't forget about the future: The impact of including future costs on the cost-effectiveness of adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccination with PCV13 in the Netherlands	VACCINE			English	Article						Cost-effectiveness analysis; Pneumococcal vaccination; Future costs; Unrelated medical costs; Non-medical consumption; Cost-effectiveness thresholds	HEALTH; DISEASE; CONSUMPTION; UTILITY; DEATH	Background: When vaccines increase longevity, vaccinated people may experience costs and benefits during added life-years. These future benefits and costs may include increased productivity as well as medical and non-medical costs. Such impacts should be considered in cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) of vaccines but are often omitted. Here, we illustrate the impact of including future costs on the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against pneumococcus disease. We emphasize the relevance of differentiating cost estimates between risk groups. Methods: We updated an existing Dutch CEA of vaccination against pneumococcus disease with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) to include all future medical and non-medical costs. We linked costs by age and risk with survival information and estimates of cases prevented per vaccination strategy based on the original study to calculate the impact of inclusion. Future medical costs were adjusted for relevant risk groups. Results: For the base-case strategy, the original incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of PVC13 was (sic)9,157 per quality adjusted life-year (QALY). Including all future medical costs increased the ICER to (sic)28,540 per QALY. Also including future non-medical costs resulted in an ICER of (sic)45,691 per QALY. The impact of future medical costs varied considerably per risk group and generally increased with age. Discussion and conclusion: This study showed a substantial effect of the inclusion of future costs on the ICER of vaccinating with PCV13. Especially when lives of people with underlying health conditions are extended, the impact of future medical costs is large. This inclusion may make vaccination a less attractive option, especially in relation to low thresholds as often applied for prevention. Although this raises important questions, ignoring these real future costs may lead to an inefficient use of healthcare resources. Our results may imply that prices for some vaccines need to be lowered to be cost-effective. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[de Vries, L. M.; Kellerborg, K. M.; Brouwer, W. B.

Michelle			Older adolescents and young adults willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine: Implications for informing public health strategies	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine hesitancy; Adolescents; Young adults; COVID-19; Public health	ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES; CARE UTILIZATION; PARENTS; ABUSE	Importance: The success in ending the COVID-19 pandemic rests partly on the mass uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. Little work has been done to understand vaccine willingness among older adolescents and young adults. This is important since this age group may be less likely to adhere to public health guide-lines. Objective: To understand willingness of getting a vaccine and reasons for vaccine hesitancy among a sam-ple of older adolescents and young adults. Design: Data were from the Well-Being and Experiences study (The WE Study), a longitudinal community-based sample of older adolescents and young adults collected from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada from 2017 to 2020 (n = 664). Setting: The study setting was a community-based observational longitudinal study. Participants: Participants for the study were aged 14 to 17 years old at baseline in 2016-17 (n = 1000). Data were also collected on one parent/caregiver. Waves 2 (n = 747) and 3 (n = 664) were collected in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Exposures: The main exposures were sociodemographic factors, health conditions, COVID-19 knowledge, and adversity history. Main Outcomes: The main outcomes were COVID-19 vaccine willingness, hesitancy, and reasons for hesi-tancy. Results: Willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine was 65.4%. Willingness did not differ by age, sex, or men-tal health conditions, but did differ for other sociodemographic characteristics, physical health condi-tions, COVID-19 knowledge, practicing social/physical distancing, and adversity history. The most common reasons for not wanting a vaccine were related to safety, knowledge, and effectiveness. Sex dif-ferences were noted. Conclusions and Relevance: Increasing uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among older adolescents and young adults may rely on targeting individuals from households with lower income, financial burden, and adversity history, and generating public health messaging specifically aimed at vaccine safety, how it works to protect against illness, and why it is important to protect oneself against a COVID-19 infection.

The introduction of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention might result in increased HBV testing and vaccination against HBV. The aim of this study was to inves-tigate the impact of the transition from risk-group to universal HBV vaccination, accounting for improve-ments in HBV testing and treatment, as well as the introduction of PrEP. Methods: We developed a mathematical model for HBV transmission among MSM. Universal vaccination was modelled by assigning some MSM (5-15% in 2028 increasing to 80-90% in 2033 and thereafter) to be vaccinated when they become sexually active. We investigated different scenarios assuming 0.5% extra vaccination rate and 0.5% extra testing rate due to PrEP consultations; and 5% of HIV-negative MSM on PrEP, that will reduce the probability of HBV acquisition by 88%. Results: Universal vaccination resulted in a reduction of 24% (interquartile range; 22-25%) of the total number of HBV infections among MSM estimated to occur from 2020 to 2070. With universal vaccination, terminating risk-group vaccination in 2030 or 2040 resulted in 30% or 10% more HBV infections over 2020-2070, respectively, compared to continuation of risk-group vaccination until 2070. With PrEP and continued risk-group vaccination, the total number of HBV infections over 2020-2070 was reduced by 13%. Conclusions: Universal HBV vaccination can lead to a major reduction in HBV incidence among MSM in the future. The reduction becomes smaller when ending risk-group HBV vaccination, but larger by PrEP use for HIV prevention. Efforts to keep high levels of HBV vaccination, testing, and treatment have to be continued in the coming decades in order to eliminate HBV as a health threat for MSM. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

It can cause hearing impairment and damage to the tympanic membrane without treatment. We aimed to determine the prevalence and association of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the nasopharynx of healthy children before the introduction of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Methods: In October 2016, nasopharyngeal swabs collection and otoscope examinations by an otolaryngologist were conducted in children aged less than 24 months in Nha Trang, Vietnam. OME was diagnosed as the presence of middle ear fluid using a digital otoscope equipped with a pneumatic otoscope. Quantitative PCR targeting pneumococci-specific lytA (the major autolysis gene) and bacterial culture were performed to detect S. pneumoniae. The point prevalence of OME in the study area was estimated. The association between OME and S. pneumoniae in the nasopharynx was evaluated using a mul-tivariable logistic regression model. Results: Among the 274 children who underwent bilateral ear examinations and nasopharyngeal swab collections, 47 had OME (17.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.9-22.1%) and 96 were colonized with S. pneumoniae (35.0%, 29.4-41.0%). OME and nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae carriage were positively asso-ciated in children aged less than 12 months (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.83, 1.40-10.51). Day-care atten-dance and living in a rural area were independently associated with OME (aOR 5.87, 2.31-14.91, and aOR 3.77, 1.58-8.99, respectively). Conclusions: The nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage was associated with OME among children aged < 12 months. A further study after introducing a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is required to better understand the effect of PCV and S. pneumoniae carriage on OME in young children. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The potential effects of deploying SARS-Cov-2 vaccines on cold storage capacity and immunization workload in countries of the WHO African Region	VACCINE			English	Article						Immunization; Africa, SARS-CoV-2; Implementation; Delivery		Background: SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be deployed to countries with limited immunization systems. Methods: We assessed the effect of deploying SARS-Cov-2 vaccines on cold storage capacity and immunization workload in a simulated WHO African Region country using region-specific data on immunization, population, healthcare workers (HCWs), cold storage capacity (quartile values for national and subnational levels), and characteristics of an approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We calculated monthly increases in vaccine doses, doses per vaccinator, and cold storage volumes for four-month SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns targeting risk groups compared to routine immunization baselines. Results: Administering SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to risk groups would increase total monthly doses by 27.0% for >= 65 years, 91.7% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.1% for HCWs. Assuming median nurse density estimates adjusted for absenteeism and proportion providing immunization services, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would increase total monthly doses per vaccinator by 29.3% for >= 65 years, 99.6% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.2% for HCWs. When we applied quartiles of actual African Region country vaccine storage capacity, routine immunization vaccine volumes exceeded national-level storage capacity for at least 75% of countries, but subnational levels had sufficient storage capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for at least 75% of countries. Conclusions: In the WHO African Region, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would substantially increase doses per vaccinator and cold storage capacity requirements over routine immunization baselines. Pandemic vaccination campaigns would increase storage requirements of national-level stores already at their limits, but sufficient capacity exists at subnational levels. Immediate attention to strengthening immunization systems is essential to support pandemic responses. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

National decision-making for the introduction of new vaccines: A systematic review, 2010-2020	VACCINE			English	Review						Infectious diseases; Immunization programs; Vaccine policy; Evidence-based decision-making; Health system strengthening; Systematic review	TECHNICAL ADVISORY GROUP; ROTAVIRUS VACCINE; HPV VACCINE; POLICY DECISIONS; IMMUNIZATION; LESSONS; IMPLEMENTATION; SUPPORT; INDIA; ESTABLISHMENT	Background: Competing priorities make using a transparent and evidence-based approach important when deciding to recommend new vaccines. We conducted a literature review to document the processes and frameworks for national decision-making on new vaccine introductions and explored which key features have evolved since 2010. Methods: We searched literature published on policymaking related to vaccine introduction from March 2010 to August 2020 in six databases. We screened articles for eligibility with the following exclusion criteria: non-human or hypothetical vaccines, the sole focus on economic evaluation or decision to adopt rather than policy decision-making. We employed nine broad categories of criteria from the 2012 review for categorization and abstracted data on the country, income level, vaccine, and other relevant criteria. Results: Of the 3808 unique references screened, 116 met eligibility criteria and were classified as: a) framework of vaccine adoption decision-making (27), b) studies that analyse empirical data on or examples of vaccine adoption decision-making (45), c) theoretical and empirical articles that provide insights into the vaccine policymaking process (44 + 17 already included in the previous categories). Commonly reported criteria for decision-making were the burden of disease; vaccine efficacy/effectiveness, safety; impact on health and non-health outcomes; economic evaluation and cost-effectiveness of alternative interventions. Programmatic and acceptability aspects were not as often considered. Most (50; 82%) of the 61 articles describing the process of vaccine introduction policymaking highlighted the role of country, regional, or global evidence-informed recommendations and a robust national governance as enabling factors for vaccine adoption. Conclusions: The literature on vaccine adoption decision-making has expanded since 2010. We found that policymakers and expert advisory committee members (e.g., National Immunization Technical Advisory Group [NITAG]) increasingly value the interventions based on economic evaluations. The results of this review could guide discussions on evidence-informed immunization decision-making among country, sub-regional, and regional stakeholders. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Using nationwide claims data for years 2013-2016, adult patients (aged 18-64 years) were followed from their first diagnosis for a condition deeming them high-risk for invasive pneumococcal disease through the subsequent 365 days and observed for pneumococcal vaccination in outpatient clinics and pharmacies. Publicly-available data on select social determinants of health were incorporated into analyses, guided by the WHO vaccine hesitancy matrix. Controlling for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, logistic regression determined predictors of vaccination and a general linear model compared days to being vaccinated. Results: A total of 173,712 patients were analyzed of which approximately one quarter (25.3%) were vaccinated against invasive pneumococcal disease within the first year of being deemed high risk, nearly all of which (98.5%) were received in outpatient clinics. The odds of vaccination were higher among urban residents (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.144-1.223), areas of higher health literacy (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.019-1.025), and more Democratic-voting communities (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.23-1.88). Conversely, the likelihood of vaccination was particularly low in areas of higher poverty (OR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.068-0.304) and with limited Internet access (OR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.062-0.305) as well as among adults who did not also get a seasonal influenza vaccine (OR: 0.05; 95% CI: 0.048-0.052). Time to vaccination was longer in rural residents (B = 8.3, p < 0.0001) and communities with less Internet access (B = 75.6, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Social determinants may be influencing pneumococcal vaccine-seeking behavior among those deemed high-risk, but a more formal and comprehensive framework must be assessed to determine the full impact of these factors across vaccines recommended in adults.

Postmarketing safety surveillance of quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine: Reports to the vaccine adverse event reporting system	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza; Vaccine; Adverse event; Postmarketing safety	GUILLAIN-BARRE-SYNDROME	On October 7, 2016, the Food and Drug Administration approved recombinant hemagglutinin quadrivalent influenza vaccine (RIV4) (Spodoptera frugiperda cell line; Flublok Quadrivalent) for active immunization for the prevention of influenza disease in individuals 18 years of age and older. Clinical trials did not reveal any major differences in adverse events or serious adverse events following Flublok Quadrivalent versus standard-dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. To improve our understanding of the safety profile of this vaccine, we reviewed and summarized adverse event reports after Flublok Quadrivalent administration to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Through June 30, 2020, VAERS received 849 reports after RIV4 vaccination. The vast majority (810; 95%) were non-serious. Among serious events, there were 10 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, including 5 people who required mechanical ventilation and 2 people who died. Many allergic reactions were reported as non-serious, but required interventions to treat a life-threatening event, e.g., epinephrine, nebulizers, albuterol, glucocorticoids, and supplemental oxygen. Two people experienced a positive rechallenge (i.e., allergic reactions after repeated vaccination with RIV4), including a person who-despite premedication with antihistamines-developed respiratory difficulties, required epinephrine, and was transported to the emergency department. The occurrence of anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions in some individuals may reflect an underlying predisposition to atopy that may manifest itself after an exposure to any drug or vaccine, and does not necessarily suggest that Flublok Quadrivalent is particularly allergenic. Postmarketing safety surveillance will continue to be vital for understanding the benefits and risks of quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Single-dose intranasal subunit vaccine rapidly clears secondary sepsis in a high-dose pneumonic plague infection	VACCINE			English	Article						Yersinia pestis; Plague; Mucosal vaccine; Subunit vaccine; Tobacco Mosaic Virus		Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, has killed millions throughout human history. Though public health initiatives have reduced the number of plague cases, it remains endemic in many areas of the world. It also remains a significant threat for use as a biological weapon. Naturally occurring multidrug antibiotic resistance has been observed in Y. pestis, and resistant strains have been engineered for use as a biological weapon. Vaccines represent our best means of protection against the threat of antibiotic resistant plague. We have developed a vaccine consisting of two Y. pestis virulence factors, LcrV (V) and F1, conjugated to Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV), a safe, non-replicating plant virus that can be administered mucosally, providing complete protection against pneumonic plague, the deadliest form of the disease and the one most likely to be seen in a biological attack. A single intranasal (i.n.) dose of TMV-F1 + TMV-V (TMV-F1/V) protected 88% of mice against lethal challenge with 100 LD50 of Y. pestis CO92pgm-, while immunization with rF1 + rV without TMV was not protective. Serum and tissues were collected at various timepoints after challenge to assess bacterial clearance, histopathology, cytokine production, and antibody production. Overall, TMV-F1/V immunized mice showed a significant reduction in histopathology, bacterial burden, and inflammatory cytokine production following challenge compared to rF1 + rV vaccinated and unvaccinated mice. Pneumonic challenge resulted in systemic dissemination of the bacteria in all groups, but only TMV-F1/V immunized mice rapidly cleared bacteria from the spleen and liver. There was a direct correlation between pre-challenge serum F1 titers and recovery in all immunized mice, strongly suggesting a role for antibody in the neutralization and/or opsonization of Y. pestis in this model. Mucosal administration of a single dose of a Y. pestis TMV-based subunit vaccine, without any additional adjuvant, can effectively protect mice from lethal infection. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

K.; Zimmerman, Richard K.; Eng, Heather; Lyons, Jason; Clarke, Lloyd; Nowalk, Mary Patricia			Comparison of local influenza vaccine effectiveness using two methods	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza; Vaccine; Vaccine effectiveness; Administrative databases	UNITED-STATES; VIRUS; PROTECTION	Background: In some settings, research methods to determine influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) may not be appropriate because of cost, time constraints, or other factors. Administrative database analysis of viral testing results and vaccination history may be a viable alternative. This study compared VE estimates from outpatient research and administrative databases. Methods: Using the test-negative, case-control design, data for 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 influenza seasons were collected using: 1) consent, specimen collection, RT-PCR testing and vaccine verification using multiple methods; and 2) an administrative database of outpatients with a clinical respiratory viral panel combined with electronic immunization records. Odds ratios for likelihood of influenza infection by vaccination status were calculated using multivariable logistic regression. VE = (1 - aOR) x 100. Results: Research participants were significantly younger (P < 0.001), more often white (69% vs. 59%; P < 0.001) than non-white and less frequently enrolled through the emergency department (35% vs. 72%; P < 0.001) than administrative database participants. VE was significant against all influenza and influenza A in each season and both seasons combined (37-49%). Point estimate differences between methods were evident, with higher VE in the research database, but insignificant due to low sample sizes. When enrollment sites were separately analyzed, there were significant differences in VE estimates for all influenza (66% research vs. 46% administrative P < 0.001) and influenza A (67% research vs. 49% administrative; P < 0.001) in the emergency department. Conclusions: The selection of the appropriate method for determining influenza vaccine effectiveness depends on many factors, including sample size, subgroups of interest, etc., suggesting that research estimates may be more generalizable. Other advantages of research databases for VE estimates include lack of clinician-related selection bias for testing and less misclassification of vaccination status. The advantages of the administrative databases are potentially shorter time to VE results and lower cost. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Balasubramani, G.

We conducted a phase II, randomized, partially-blinded trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an MF59-adjuvanted inactivated, split virion, H7N9 influenza vaccine (H7N9 IIV) administered at various dose levels and schedules in older adults. Methods: 479 adults >= 65 years of age in stable health were randomized to one of six groups to receive either 3.75, 7.5 or 15 mu g of influenza A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7N9) IIV adjuvanted with MF59 given as a 3-dose series either on days 1, 28 and 168 or on days 1, 57 and 168. Immunogenicity was assessed using both hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralization (MN) assays prior to and 28 days following each dose. Safety was assessed through 1 year following the last dose. Results: Subjects in all groups had only modest immune responses, with the HAI GMT < 20 after the second vaccine dose and <29 after the third vaccine dose. HAI titers >= 40 were seen in <37% of subjects after the second dose and <49% after the third dose. There were no significant differences seen between the two dose schedules. MN titers followed similar patterns, although the titers were approximately twofold higher than the HAI titers. Logistic regression modeling demonstrated no statistically significant associations between the immune responses and age, sex or body mass index whereas recent prior receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine significantly reduced the HAI response [OR 0.13 (95% CI 0.05, 0.33); p < 0.001]. Overall, the vaccine was well tolerated. Two mild potentially immune mediated adverse events occurred, lichen planus and guttate psoriasis. Conclusions: MF59-adjuvanted H7N9 IIV was only modestly immunogenic in the older adult population following three doses. There were no significant differences in antibody responses noted among the various antigen doses or the two dose schedules. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Singh, J; Malik, D; Raina, A				Singh, Jitender; Malik, Deepti; Raina, Ashvinder			Immuno-informatics approach for B-cell and T-cell epitope based peptide vaccine design against novel COVID-19 virus	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Vaccine; Epitopes; B-cell; T-cell; 3D modeling; Docking		COVID-19 has brought the world to a standstill with a wave of destruction in country after country with tremendous loss of lives and livelihood in advanced to developing nations. Whole world is staring at the prospect of repeated lockdowns with another wave of COVID-19 predicted to hit the world in September of 2020. The second wave is assumed to be even more destructive with severe impact across much of the world. The only way to defeat this pandemic is to quickly develop a safe and effective vaccine against this raging menace and initiate a global vaccination drive. Our study is an attempt to deploy various computational methods to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes from the spike surface glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2 which have the novel potential for vaccine development against COVID-19. For this we have taken 8 unique strains with one each from India, China, France, USA, Italy, Australia, Iran and Pakistan. The strain data was extracted from NCBI Database. By analyzing the immune parameters like surface accessibility, antigenicity, variability, conservancy, flexibility, hydrophilicity, allergenicity and toxicity of the conserved sequences of spike glycoprotein using various databases and bioinformatics tools, we identified two potential novel linear (SGTNGTKRFDN and ASVYAWNRK) and one structural B-cell epitope as well as two T-cell epitopes (RLFRKSNLK and IPTNFTISV) which can be used as epitope-based peptide vaccines. Docking simulation assay revealed that above T-cell epitopes have minimum free binding energy and showed strong hydrogen bond interaction which strengthened its potential as being a T-cell epitope for the epitope-based novel vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This study allows us to claim that B-cell and T-cell epitopes mentioned above provide potential pathways for developing an exploratory vaccine against spike surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 with high confidence for the identified strains. We will need to confirm our findings with biological assays. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We stratified analysis by age group (<19, 19-49, >= 50 years), describing reports by serious/non-serious status, sex, time to symptom onset after vaccination, vaccine(s) administered, and exposure to other known causes of myopericarditis. We used Empirical Bayesian data mining to detect disproportionate reporting of myopericarditis after vaccination. Results: VAERS received 620,195 reports during 1990-2018: 708 (0.1%) met the case definition or were physician-diagnosed as myopericarditis. Most (79%) myopericarditis reports described males; 69% were serious; 72% had symptom onset <= 2 weeks postvaccination. Overall, smallpox (59%) and anthrax (23%) vaccines were most commonly reported. By age, among persons aged < 19 years, Haemophilus influenzae type b (22, 22%) and hepatitis B (18, 18%); among persons aged 19-49 years smallpox (387, 79%); among persons aged >= 50 years inactivated influenza (31, 36%) and live attenuated zoster (19, 22%) vaccines were most commonly reported. The vaccines most commonly reported remained unchanged when excluding 138 reports describing other known causes of myopericarditis. Data mining revealed disproportionate reporting of myopericarditis only after smallpox vaccine. Conclusions: Despite the introduction of new vaccines over the years, myopericarditis remains rarely reported after vaccines licensed for use in the United States. In this analysis, myopericarditis was most commonly reported after smallpox vaccine, and less commonly after other vaccines. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report on improvements made to the SAAVI MVA-C vaccine design which include: the use of different promoters for both the Gag and Env genes, replacement of the native Gag gene with an in silico designed subtype C mosaic Gag antigen which forms virus-like particles and the modification of Env by sequence changes to improve stability and transport to the cell surface. A head-to-head comparison of the newly conceived MVAGD5 candidate vaccine with SAAVI MVA-C showed increased in vitro expression of both Env and Gag, and superior immunogenicity in rabbits. MVAGD5 induced high levels of binding antibodies to Env and Tier 1A and 1B neutralizing antibodies, neither of which were induced by SAAVI MVA-C. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

There is little research on individuals' COVID-19 vaccination decision-making. Objective: We aimed to determine individual preferences for COVID-19 vaccinations in China, and to assess the factors influencing vaccination decision-making to facilitate vaccination coverage. Methods: A D-efficient discrete choice experiment was conducted across six Chinese provinces selected by the stratified random sampling method. Vaccine choice sets were constructed using seven attributes: vaccine effectiveness, side-effects, accessibility, number of doses, vaccination sites, duration of vaccine protection, and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Conditional logit and latent class models were used to identify preferences. Results: Although all seven attributes were proved to significantly influence respondents' vaccination decision, vaccine effectiveness, side-effects and proportion of acquaintances vaccinated were the most important. We also found a higher probability of vaccinating when the vaccine was more effective; risks of serious side effects were small; vaccinations were free and voluntary; the fewer the number of doses; the longer the protection duration; and the higher the proportion of acquaintances vaccinated. Higher local vaccine coverage created altruistic herd incentives to vaccinate rather than free-rider problems. The predicted vaccination uptake of the optimal vaccination scenario in our study was 84.77%. Preference heterogeneity was substantial. Individuals who were older, had a lower education level, lower income, higher trust in the vaccine and higher perceived risk of infection, displayed a higher probability to vaccinate. Conclusions: Preference heterogeneity among individuals should lead health authorities to address the diversity of expectations about COVID-19 vaccinations. To maximize COVID-19 vaccine uptake, health authorities should promote vaccine effectiveness; pro-actively communicate the absence or presence of vaccine side effects; and ensure rapid and wide media communication about local vaccine coverage.

The regional centre of Maitland had high numbers and rates of children who were overdue for scheduled vaccinations (2016, n = 344, 37.7%). Families were not opposed to immunization but had conflicting priorities or experienced service access barriers. A tailored strategy was developed including friendly, personalised reminders, outreach appointments and home visiting for those families most in need. Research translation was not quick and easy. A process evaluation identified areas where more support was needed to advance the strategy. Coverage rates have increased from 62.3% (2016) to 86.2% (2020). The number of overdue children has decreased even during COVID-19 restrictions when health services expected families would avoid primary care services. The TIP approach is valuable for improving childhood immunization coverage and is being utilised in other communities with low coverage. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This review chronicles the narrow path that led to approval and world-wide acceptance of BCG immunotherapy for bladder cancer while immunotherapy trials in other malignancies were abandoned. Six intravesical instillations of 5x10(boolean AND)8 CFU of BCG weekly after bladder tumor resection, first reported in 1976, is superior to resection alone and resection plus intravesical chemotherapy. Maintenance of effective immune stimulation is surprisingly difficult, but 3 weekly treatments 3, 6, and 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months after induction produces further significant reduction in tumor recurrence. This 3 week BCG maintenance schedule alone has reduced disease progression and mortality in multicenter randomized clinical trials. In the new age of immuno-oncology patients with many types of cancer now benefit from immunotherapy, but currently these modern agents are prohibitively expensive for most of the world. In contrast, the low cost and therefore low profitability of BCG has resulted in recurrent shortages that threaten both bladder cancer patients and children at risk for tuberculosis and other serious infections. Humanity has greatly benefited from early 20th century science that developed BCG and the benevolence of doctors Calmette and Guerin who put people over profit and widely shared cultures of the vaccine. The 21st century is bringing new immunotherapies and greatly expanding the types of malignancies that can be treated. Recombinant technology is expected to improve both the efficacy and production of BCG, hopefully expanding the availability of BCG and relieving the recurring supply shortage for both vaccination and cancer therapy.

We also compared the willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccine before and after its availability to assess changes in perception and attitude towards vaccination. Materials and Methods: Recovered patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure from SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in the ICU at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 were followed up over a 1-year period to assess vaccine acceptability and acceptance rates, and changes in perception towards COVID-19 vaccination before and after vaccine availability. Results: A total of 98 and 93 patients completed the initial and follow up surveys respectively. During the initial survey, 41% of the patients intended to receive vaccination, 46% responded they would not accept a vaccine against COVID-19 even if it were proven to be 'safe and effective 'and 13% undecided. During the follow up survey, 44% of the study cohort had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Major reasons provided by respondents for not accepting COVID-19 vaccine were lack of trust in the effectiveness of the vaccine, pharmaceutical companies, government, vaccine technology, fear of side effects and perceived immunity against COVID-19. Respondents were more likely to be vaccinated if recommended by their physicians (OR 6.4, 95% CI 2.8-8.3), employers (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.9-5.8), and family and friends (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-4.5). Conclusion: We found a suboptimal COVID-19 vaccination rate in a cohort of patients who recovered from severe infection. COVID-19 vaccine information and recommendation by healthcare providers, employers, and family and friends may improve vaccination uptake. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Too low public vaccine confidence, which results in insufficient vaccine uptake, remains an area of concern for EU policy-makers. Within the European Joint action on vaccination, a work-package dedicated to research aims to define tools and methods for priority setting in the field of vaccination research. We therefore propose a prioritization framework to identify research priorities towards generating and synthesizing evidence to support policies and strategies aiming at increasing vaccine coverage. Materials/methods: We used a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method inspired by the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative developed by Rudan et al. This quantitative methodology follows a series of steps involving different groups of experts and relevant stakeholders. The first step consists in identifying key research questions through a broad consultation. In parallel, a first group of experts is tasked to select criteria for prioritization of research questions, taking into consideration the ultimate goal of the exercise. Another group of experts is then requested to assess a weight to each of the criteria, using pair-wise comparisons. The final step consists in gathering experts who will assess each research question against the weighted criteria. This evaluation leads to assigning a score to each individual research question, which can then be ranked in order of priority. Results: We focused our work on four pre-selected pilot vaccines (pertussis, measles containing combination vaccines, influenza and HPV). The consultation generated 124 questions, which were secondarily sorted and re-worded to obtain 27 questions to be ranked. Criteria for setting priorities were the following: accessibility, answerability, deliverability, disease prevalence/incidence, effectiveness, equity, generalization, and territory. During a final face-to-face meeting international experts ranked the 27 questions and agreed on a consensual list of six top-priorities. Conclusions: We have developed a transparent, evidence-based rigorous framework to defined key research questions to generate evidence towards the design of policies and strategies to increase vaccine coverage. Results were disseminated broadly and submitted to the EC for potential funding in the context of The Horizon Europe Program. The same process will be conducted in 2021 to identify vaccination research priorities regarding all vaccines used in the EU as well as COVID-19 vaccines. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A dual kisspeptin-GnRH immunogen for reproductive immunosterilization	VACCINE			English	Article						GnRH; Kisspeptin; Immunosterilisation; Contraception; Reproduction; Vaccine	GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING-HORMONE; TESTOSTERONE LEVELS; OVARIAN-FUNCTION; ANTIBODY-TITERS; PROSTATE-CANCER; VACCINATION; IMMUNIZATION; PUBERTY; SUPPRESSION; BEHAVIOR	GnRH immunogens have been extensively employed in immunocontraception of animals. While they are effective, they are not 100% efficacious and of limited duration. GnRH secretion is dependent on upstream stimulation by kisspeptin. We therefore hypothesised that a dual immunogen combining GnRH and kisspeptin may be more efficacious through targeting two levels of the axis. We have previously shown GnRH immunogen elicits permanent sterilisation when sheep are vaccinated neonatally suggesting that the efficacy of GnRH immunisation may be dependent on the stage of reproductive development. We have now studied over 300 days the efficacy of immunisation with a dual immunogen comprising GnRH linked to kisspeptin via a hepatitis B T helper peptide sequence (GKT) administered to male and female rats prepubertally, pubertally and as adults. At all stages of development all immunised animals produced antibodies to GnRH, kisspeptin and GKT but differentially in titre with respect to sex and stage of development. In immunised adult, prepubertal and pubertal males testosterone and testes length was markedly reduced by 60 days and remained at low levels until day 150. Thereafter, testosterone recovered to pre immunisation levels and testes length increased to a maximum of about 40% of controls. 80% of males were infertile in three matings over 250 days. In prepubertal and pubertal female rats a single immunisation at day 0 reduced estradiol to low levels by day 60 which remained low until termination of the experiment on day 300. In matings of these females with fertile males on days 90,120 and 250, 74% of prepubertal females were infertile and impressively, 100% (10/10) of pubertal females were infertile after a single immunisation on day 0. These findings set the scene for exploration of immunosterilisation of wild and domestic animals after a single immunisation. Crown Copyright (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Continuity of routine immunization programs in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Vaccination; Immunization; Routine; Vaccine; Pandemic	IMPACT	Introduction: In Canada, the COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted many routine health services, placed additional strain on the health care system, and resulted in many Canadians being either unable or unwilling to attend routine immunization appointments. We sought to capture and synthesize informa-tion about changes to routine immunization programs in response to the pandemic and plans to catch-up any missed immunizations. Methods: Provincial/territorial (P/T) public health leaders were interviewed via teleconference between August-October 2020 to collect information on the following topics: how routine immunization delivery was affected during and after initial lockdown periods, plans to catch-up missed doses, and major chal-lenges and achievements in continuing routine immunization programs. Data were coded and catego-rized according to common responses and descriptive analysis was performed. Results: Interviews occurred with participants from 11 of 13 P/Ts. School immunization programs were reported to be most negatively affected by the pandemic (n = 9). In the early pandemic period, infant, pre-school, and maternal/prenatal programs were prioritized, with most P/Ts continuing these services with adaptations for COVID-19. After the initial lockdown period, all routine programs were continuing with adaptations in most P/Ts. Infant, preschool, and school programs were most often targeted for catch-up through measures such as appointment rebooking and making additional clinics and/or providers avail-able. Major challenges included resource limitations (e.g., staff shortages, PPE shortages, limited infras-tructure) (n = 11), public health restrictions (n = 8), and public hesitancy to attend appointments (n = 5). Conclusions: Canadian routine immunization programs faced some disruptions due to the COVID-19 pan-demic, particularly the school, adult, and older adult programs. Further research is needed to determine the measurable impact of the pandemic on routine vaccine coverage levels. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted an online survey of 1,119 parents and caregivers of children < 12 years in New York City from March 9 to April 11, 2021. Among parents surveyed, 61.9% reported plans to vaccinate their youngest child for COVID-19, 14.8% said they do not plan to vaccinate their child and 23.3% were unsure. Female and non-Hispanic Black parents were least likely to report plans to vaccinate their children. Safety, effectiveness and perceptions that children do not need vaccination were the primary reasons for vaccine hesitancy/resistance. Parents who have or will vaccinate themselves were significantly more likely to report they would vaccinate their children. Efforts to increase awareness about vaccine safety and education about the importance of vaccinating children are needed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This presentation utilizing a trileucine-trehalose excipient system was designed to be both thermostable and suitable for respiratory delivery. The stability of the spray-dried vaccine powder was assessed over one year at various storage temperatures (-20, 5, 25, 40, 50 degrees C) in terms of powder stability, adjuvant stability, and antigen stability. A formulation without trileucine was included as a control. The results showed that the interior particle structure and exterior particle morphology of the powder was maintained for one year at 40 degrees C, while the control case exhibited a small extent of particle fusing under the same storage conditions. Moisture content was maintained, and powder solid state remained amorphous for all storage temperatures. Aerosol performance was assessed with a commercial dry powder inhaler in combination with a human mouth-throat model. The emitted dose and lung dose were maintained for all samples after one year at temperatures up to 40 degrees C. Nanoemulsion size and oil content of the adjuvant system were maintained after one year at temperatures up to 40 degrees C, and the agonist content was maintained after one year at temperatures up to 25 degrees C. The antigen was completely degraded in the control formulation at seven months of storage at 40 degrees C; by contrast, 45% of the antigen was still present in the trehalose-trileucine formulation after one year of storage at 50 degrees C. Comparatively, the antigen was completely degraded in a liquid sample of the vaccine candidate after only one month of storage at 37 degrees C. The spray-dried trehalose-trileucine vaccine powder clearly maintained its inhalable properties after one year's storage at high temperatures and improved overall thermostability of the vaccine.

Our study aimed to understand the state of MNI policies, strategies and implementation practices in Latin America (LA). Methods: Study conducted in 5 middle-income countries: Argentina, Brazil, Honduras, Mexico and Peru. The methods included a desk review, interviews with national stakeholders and health care providers, focus groups with pregnant women and observations in health facilities. Enablers and barriers were identified and categorized as individual, societal or related to the health system. Results: All 5 parti cipating countries had similar MNI policies and high access to antenatal care. Key enablers were the high acceptability of vaccination during pregnancy, high-level of political will and a national legal framework ensuring free access to vaccines. At the health system level, implementation was facilitated by the existence of immunization advisory committees, a pooled vaccine procurement mechanism, complementary vaccine delivery strategies, conditional cash transfer to users and performance incentives to health facilities. The main programmatic barriers were the lack of adequate MNI information; limited coordination between antenatal and immunization services; inadequate supply, resources and infrastructure; high staff turnover; insufficient training for health care providers; and weak monitoring and reporting systems. Conclusion: Middle-income countries in LA have successfully implemented MNI programs and several enablers were identified. To overcome remaining barriers, there is a need to focus on improving the "immunization journey" for pregnant women through providing more clear and timely information to users and providers; removing barriers to access; ensuring adequate supply, human resources and infrastructure; making the health service experience positive; and establishing integrated information systems that allow for monitoring the progress toward achieving MNI goals. Strengthening the MNI programs can also improve equitable access to health services and prepare for the introduction of future vaccines for pregnant women. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted among paediatricians practising in Kerala, India, to assess their knowledge and reporting behaviour in AEFI surveillance as well as to identify barriers to reporting. Results: A random sample of 380 paediatricians were contacted of whom, 243 (63.9%) participated in the survey. The understanding scores were distributed as follows: 30.9% very high or high, 40.3% moderate, and 28.8% low. Formal training was significantly associated with higher understanding scores, and increased AEFI detection and reporting. Only 42.0% of respondents had formal training; paediatricians in the public sector had higher access to training than those in the private sector. There were 141 respondents (58.0%) who identified an AEFI in the previous year, of whom 66 (46.8%) reported it. The main barriers to AEFI reporting were: difficulties with reporting process (28.9%); fear of raising public alarm (28.1%); time constraints (22.3%); fear of personal consequences (15.7%); and belief that health authorities rarely take useful action (11.6%). Conclusion: Training in AEFI surveillance should be prioritised for HCPs with greater emphasis in medical education programmes. Study showed that a user-friendly reporting mechanism and a blame-free culture are crucial to improve AEFI reporting practices. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We investigated the distribution of measles infection and vaccination in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Ethiopian measles case classification guidelines, measles cases were classified as laboratory-confirmed, clinically compatible, and epidemiologically linked. We derived measles vaccination coverage estimates using reported measles vaccine efficacy and, the proportion of measles cases vaccinated with measles vaccine at least once from the surveillance data. We calculated measles effective reproduction number (Re) in the region. Almost twenty-five thousand measles cases were reported through the surveillance system, with more than 50% of the suspected and confirmed measles cases reported in 2015. Measles had sustained and high transmission rate with uneven distribution among the zones. Children between 1 and 4 years of age and MCV unvaccinated individuals were the most affected groups. In all the zones, the average surveillance-estimated MCV coverage among both infants and under-five children was significantly lower than the WHO recommended minimum 90% threshold herd-immunity. With this level of vaccination coverage, an infected case can transmit to more than four individuals. Nevertheless, the administrative coverage reports for the concurrent period were consistently above 90%. The estimated MCV coverage across the Oromia region was well below the recommended herd-immunity threshold. It partly explains the apparent mismatch of sustained measles transmission and outbreaks despite the very high administrative coverage estimates. Oromia regional health bureau, in collaboration with key stakeholders, should make a concerted effort to increase the effective-coverage of MCV to at least 90%. Additionally, multiple-dose MCV has to be scaled-up and accompanied with appropriate geographic and age targeting using evidence from surveillance data. Immediate programmatic action is needed to improve the quality of measles surveillance. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zimmerman, RK				Zimmerman, Richard K.			Helping patients with ethical concerns about COVID-19 vaccines in light of fetal cell lines used in some COVID-19 vaccines	VACCINE			English	Editorial Material						COVID-19 vaccines; Vaccine ethics; Fetal cell line ethics		Many persons with religious convictions report hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccines, in part due to ethical concerns that fetal cell lines are used in the development of certain vaccines. The issue of abortion is contentious and, given the potential impact on COVID-19 vaccination, it is important for clinicians to be aware of this issue, whatever their personal beliefs. I provide four responses that clinicians may offer their patients: 1) Ethical analyses of moral complicity and COVID vaccines. 2) Altruism and protecting others from a virus that is often transmitted while asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. 3) Religious texts and many religious leaders support prevention and, therefore, vaccination. 4) Administration of vaccines not developed in fetal cell lines. Although I wish for all my patients to be vaccinated, I respect their autonomy to make the choice to be or not to be vaccinated and understand that many have a deep regard for fetal life.

This contrasts with the whole virus particle vaccines (WPVs) originally used against influenza that were immunogenic in both adults and children but were replaced by SV in the 1970s due to concerns with reactogenicity. In this study, we re-evaluated the immunogenicity of WPV and SV, prepared from the same batch of purified influenza virus, in cynomolgus macaques and confirmed that WPV is superior to SV in priming potency. In addition, we compared the ability of WPV and SV to induce innate immune responses, including the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro. WPV stimulated greater production of inflammatory cytokines and type-I interferon in immune cells from mice and macaques compared to SV. Since these innate responses are likely triggered by the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) by viral RNA, the quantity and quality of viral RNA in each vaccine were assessed. Although the quantity of viral RNA was similar in the two vaccines, the amount of viral RNA of a length that can be recognized by PRRs was over 100-fold greater in WPV than in SV. More importantly, 1000-fold more viral RNA was delivered to DCs by WPV than by SV when exposed to preparations containing the same amount of HA protein. Furthermore, WPV induced up regulation of the DC maturation marker CD86 on murine DCs, while SV did not. The present results suggest that the activation of antigen-presenting DCs, by PRR-recognizable viral RNA contained in WPV is responsible for the effective priming potency of WPV observed in naive mice and macaques. WPV is thus recommended as an alternative option for seasonal influenza vaccines, especially for children. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, an exploratory clinical study utilizing mul-tiple gp120 envelope proteins as vaccine antigens was pursued, which required a harmonized platform development approach for timely and efficient manufacture of the combined HIV vaccine product. Development of cell lines, processes, and analytical methods was initiated with a transmitted founder envelope protein (CH505TF), then applied to produce three subsequent gp120 Env (envelope) variants. Cell lines were developed using the commercially available Freedom CHO DG44 kit (Life Technologies). The fed-batch cell culture production process was based on a commercially-available medium with har-monized process parameters across the variants. A platform purification process was developed utilizing a mixed mode chromatography capture step, with ceramic hydroxyapatite and ion exchange polishing steps. A suite of analytical methods was developed to establish and monitor the Quality Target Profile (QTP), release and long-term stability testing of the vaccine products. The platform development strategy was successfully implemented to produce four gp120 envelope protein variants. In some cases, minor changes to the platform were required to optimize for a particular variant; however, baseline conditions for the processes (cell line type, media & feed system, chromatog-raphy resins, and analytical approaches) remained constant, leading to successful transfer and manufac-ture of all four proteins in a cGMP facility. This body of work demonstrates successful pursuit of a platform development approach to manufac-ture important vaccine candidates and can be used as a model for other vaccine glycoproteins, such as HIV gp140 trimers or other viral glycoproteins with global health implications.

Impact of prior vaccination on antibody response and influenza-like illness among Australian healthcare workers after influenza vaccination in 2016	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza vaccine; Antibody; Prior vaccination; Healthcare worker; Seroepidemiology; Immunogenicity; Influenza-like illness	VIRUS; NEURAMINIDASE; INFECTION; A(H3N2)	Background: Epidemiological studies suggest that influenza vaccine effectiveness decreases with repeated administration. We examined antibody responses to influenza vaccination among healthcare workers (HCWs) by prior vaccination history and determined the incidence of influenza infection. Methods: HCWs were vaccinated with the 2016 Southern Hemisphere quadrivalent influenza vaccine. Serum samples were collected pre-vaccination, 21-28 days and 7 months post-vaccination. Influenza antibody titres were measured at each time-point using the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Immunogenicity was compared by prior vaccination history. Results: A total of 157 HCWs completed the study. The majority were frequently vaccinated, with only 5 reporting no prior vaccinations since 2011. Rises in titres for all vaccine strains among vaccine-na & iuml;ve HCWs were significantly greater than rises observed for HCWs who received between 1 and 5 prior vac-cinations (p < 0.001, respectively). Post-vaccination GMTs against influenza A but not B strains decreased as the number of prior vaccinations increased from 1 to 5. There was a significant decline in GMTs post-season for both B lineages. Sixty five (41%) HCWs reported at least one influenza-like illness episode, with 6 (4%) identified as influenza positive. Conclusions: Varying serological responses to influenza vaccination were observed among HCWs by prior vaccination history, with vaccine-na & iuml;ve HCWs demonstrating greater post-vaccination responses against A(H3N2).

J	Gramacho, WG; Turgeon, M				Gramacho, Wladimir G.; Turgeon, Mathieu			When politics collides with public health: COVID-19 vaccine country of origin and vaccination acceptance in Brazil	VACCINE			English	Article							ACCEPTABILITY	This study examines the effect of the country of origin of the vaccine on vaccination acceptance against COVID-19. More specifically, we show how the political context in Brazil has affected acceptance of vaccines produced in China, Russia, the US, and England at the University of Oxford. Our data come from a survey experiment applied to a national sample of 2771 adult Brazilians between September 23 and October 2, 2020. We find greater rejection among Brazilians for vaccines developed in China and Russia, as compared to vaccines from the US or England. We also find that rejection of the Chinese-developed vaccine is particularly strong among those who support President Jair Bolsonaro-a COVID-19 denier and strong critic of China and vaccination, in general.

Healthcare providers' interpretations of product labelling information developed through a consensus stakeholder approach	VACCINE			English	Article						Immunization; Influenza; Pertussis; Pregnancy; Vaccination; Product labelling information	INFLUENZA VACCINATION; PREGNANT-WOMEN; MATERNAL IMMUNIZATION; PERTUSSIS-VACCINE; LACTATION; PACKAGE; SAFETY	Background: The World Health Organization recommends immunization with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during pregnancy. Yet, product labelling information for IIV and Tdap sends a different message. In a previous study, we developed evidence based statements about vaccination in pregnancy that could be included in product information. This study compares healthcare providers' perceptions of the revised statements to those currently used in vaccine product labelling information. Methods: A 30-item online survey with qualitative and quantitative components was distributed to Canadian maternal healthcare providers via professional organizations and public health. Participants read excerpts from revised and existing IIV and Tdap product labelling information and answered questions about how they perceived the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, whether they would recommend each vaccine during pregnancy, and which statements they preferred. Results: From June to August 2018, 449 healthcare providers completed the survey, including physicians (45%), nurses (24%), midwives (27%) and others (5%). Most participants perceived the vaccines to be safe and effective based on the revised statements. Over twice as many participants said they would recommend the IIV and Tdap vaccines in pregnancy based on the revised rather than the existing statements (64% versus 21% for IIV and 63% versus 27% for Tdap). Most participants selected that the revised statements better explained the risks and benefits of vaccination in pregnancy (65% versus 21% for IIV; 51% versus 27% for Tdap). Qualitative comments highlighted the strengths of the revised statements and areas for improvement. Conclusions: The majority of participants demonstrated preferences for the revised IIV and Tdap product label statements over the existing statements. Comments suggested the revised statements include improvements to the evidence-base and readability. Involving stakeholders improved the development of product labelling information, but further improvement is needed to support the evidence-based use of vaccines in pregnancy. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

A national outbreak with infant deaths occurred in the UK in 2012, yet outbreaks remain localized and death from pertussis rare in Canada. Aim: We explored whether past outbreaks in children may influence future risk when those children become parents. Methods: We conducted an ecological within-country birth cohort analysis in women of childbearing age of the relative risk of ever having pertussis infection by two points in time, 2002 and 2012, comparing with 1992 as the baseline. We used notified cases of pertussis in England and Wales and Canada to compare trends in relative risk. We projected forward to 2022 in Canada assuming incidence remained stable. Results: In Canada, the cumulative risk of previous pertussis was similar in 2002 and 2012 and, in both periods, was higher than in 1992. In England and Wales, the cumulative risk of pertussis fell stepwise from 1992 to 2012. Projecting forwards, the pattern of risk in Canada becomes similar to England and Wales in 2022. Conclusions: Widespread pertussis outbreaks in children may reduce the risk of pertussis in infants when those children become parents. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism. As birth cohorts that experienced outbreaks grow past childbearing age, pertussis burden in infants in Canada may increase, following trends observed in England and Wales.

We evaluated whether this interference remains in toddlers after booster vaccination. Methods: In a prior phase IV, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study (NCT02377349), pregnant women in Australia, Canada and Europe received intramuscular tetanus-reduced-antigen-content diphtheria-three-component acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap group) or placebo (control group) at 27(0/7)-36(6/7) weeks' gestation, with crossover immunization postpartum. Their infants were primed (study NCT02422264) and boosted (at 11-18 months; current study NCT02853929) with diphtheria-teta nus-three-component acellular pertussis-hepatitis B virus-inactivated poliovirus/Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTaP-HepB-IPV/Hib) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Immunogenicity before and after booster vaccination, and reactogenicity and safety of the booster were evaluated descriptively. Results: 263 (Tdap group) and 277 (control group) toddlers received a DTaP-HepB-IPV/Hib booster. Prebooster vaccination, observed geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for the three pertussis antigens and diphtheria were 1.4-1.5-fold higher in controls than in the Tdap group. No differences were observed for the other DTaP-HepB-IPV/Hib antigens. One month post-booster vaccination, booster response rates for pertussis antigens were >= 92.1% and seroprotection rates for the other DTaP-HepB-IPV/Hib antigens were >= 99.2% in both groups (primary objective). Higher post-booster GMCs were observed in controls versus the Tdap group for anti-filamentous hemagglutinin (1.2-fold), anti-pertussis toxoid (1.5-fold) and anti-diphtheria (1.4-fold). GMCs for the other DTaP-HepB-IPV/Hib antigens were similar between groups. Serious adverse events were reported for three toddlers (controls, not vaccination-related). One death occurred pre-booster (Tdap group, not vaccination-related). Conclusions: As a consequence of interference of maternal pertussis antibodies with infant immune responses to pertussis primary vaccination, pertussis antibody concentrations were still lower in toddlers from Tdap-vaccinated mothers before DTaP-HepB-IPV/Hib booster vaccination. After the booster, antibody concentrations were lower for filamentous hemagglutinin and pertussis toxoid but not for pertactin. The clinical significance of this interference requires further evaluation. (C) 2021 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we evaluated their safety profiles using records collected from the Chinese National Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs) Information System (CNAEFIS) and Electronic Immunization Registries System (EIRS) between 2017 and 2019. Methods: Demographic characteristics of the patients, AEFI incidence rates(IRs), symptoms, and time intervals were summarized from the reported AEFI data in the CNAEFIS. Also, the administered doses of the two vaccines were exported from the EIRS to calculate the IRs of AEFIs and thus compare the AEFIs between the two types of EV71 vaccines. Results: In total, 209, 407, and 344 AEFIs cases following EV71 vaccine administration were reported during 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively, yielding IRs of 59.2, 48.2, and 54.2 per 100,000 doses, respectively. Fever, irritability, allergic eruptions, fatigue, loss of appetite, redness and induration at the injection site were the most commonly reported AEFIs. No significant differences in rare reactions were found between the two types of EV71 vaccinations. The majority of AEFIs were developed within 30 min to 3 days after administration. Conclusion: EV71 vaccines showed satisfactory safety profiles since their first use 3 years ago in the Jiangsu Province. The AEFI profiles were identical to those in pre-marketing studies; most AEFIs after vaccination were mild and common. More active surveillance studies should be performed to provide more comprehensive post-marketing safety data. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Loiacono, MM; Pool, V; van Aalst, R				Loiacono, Matthew M.; Pool, Vitali; van Aalst, Robertus			DTaP combination vaccine use and adherence: A retrospective cohort study	VACCINE			English	Article						DTaP vaccine; Combination vaccines; Pediatrics; Vaccine coverage; Adherence; Timeliness		Despite universal recommendation of the 4-dose diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine series, coverage and timeliness in the US remain suboptimal. DTaP-containing combination vaccines (i.e. quadrivalent and pentavalent) are presumed to improve vaccine coverage rates and timeliness, but research supporting this claim is limited. We sought to investigate the associations between DTaP-containing vaccine use and adherence to the recommended DTaP immunization schedule among children in the US. Using a large claims database, we identified privately insured children born between 2009 and 2016 that received >= 1 DTaP-containing vaccine and had >= 24 months of enrollment from birth, excluding those with DTaP vaccinations not aligned with approved dose indications. Children were classified by DTaP-containing vaccine receipt: combination vaccines only, stand-alone vaccines only, or a mixture of both. Outcome measures included: 1) completion of the 4-dose series and 2) timely receipt of doses. Outcomes were adjusted for gender, birth year, race, and socioeconomic status. The study cohort contained 412,441 children. Of these, 40.5% (167,084) received combination vaccines only, 14.9% (61,342) received stand-alone vaccines only, and 44.6% (184,015) received a mixture of both. Combination vaccine recipients were nearly 3 times as likely to complete the 4-dose series (OR 2.93 (95% CI: 2.88, 2.99)) and for all doses received, more than 4 times as likely to receive doses on time (OR 4.12 (4.04, 4.21), relative to stand-alone vaccine recipients. Significance disparities in adherence were also observed, where minorities were up to 30% less likely (OR 0.70 (0.68, 0.71)) to complete the 4-dose series and up to 27% less likely (OR 0.73 (0.72, 0.75)) to receive doses on time, relative to white children. Our findings demonstrated that adherence to the recommended DTaP immunization schedule was significantly greater among combination vaccine recipients, relative to stand-alone recipients. Further research is needed to investigate underlying causes of disparities in adherence. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Dinesh			Nonclinical safety evaluation of oral recombinant anti-human papilloma virus vaccine (RHPV 16 & 18): Regulatory toxicology studies in mice, rats and rabbits - An innovative approach	VACCINE			English	Article						HPV16/HPV 18; Anti-HPV vaccine; Salmonella typhy Ty21a; Nonclinical evaluation	QUADRIVALENT VACCINE; CERVICAL-CANCER; MODEL; IMMUNOGENICITY; IMMUNIZATION	Aim: The human papilloma virus (HPV) type 16 and 18 causes nearly 70% of uterine cervical cancers. Oral administration of live Salmonella typhi Ty21a, expressing major capsid proteins (L1) of HPV 16 and 18 is a potential choice for immunization in adolescent girls under low resource settings. Present study aimed to assess the nonclinical safety of recombinant S. typhi expressing HPV 16 and 18 (rStHPV) proteins. Methodology: The acute toxicity of rStHPV was tested by intranasal single dose administration, of 10 and 50 folds higher than clinical prophylactic dose, in mice and rat followed by monitoring their survival for 14 days. Sub-chronic toxicity was evaluated in rats and rabbits with prophylactic and 5 times (average) to clinical prophylactic dosages on scheduled days (1st, 3rd & 5th day) through oral and intranasal routes. The immune/allergic response of rStHPV was assessed in mice through intranasal and intra-peritoneal routes. Experimental animals were daily monitored for live phase, and clinical chemistry, haematology, immunotoxicology, immunogenic response and histopathological examination of vital organs on 15th, 29th and 93rd days. Results: No abnormal changes were noticed in live phase activity, clinical chemistry and haematology profile. The gross necropsy, organ weights and histopathology were found to be normal. No immunotoxicity was recorded as evaluated by tier I tests. Allergic immune response, as evaluated with IgE levels was also negative irrespective of test routes. On the other hand, a significant (P < 0.01) increase of anti-HPV IgG levels was noted in mice exposed through intranasal route. Though the pre-terminal mortality was noted in mice (6-15%), rats (10%) and rabbits (15%), the autopsy revealed no signs of toxicity related to rStHPV, as the changes neither significant nor dose dependent; and even noted in vehicle control also. Conclusion: The study results suggested 'no observable adverse effects' of rStHPV even at higher dosages (5, 10 & 50 folds) than intended clinical dose. A significant increase of anti-HPV specific IgG suggests the immunogenicity of vaccine. The innovative approach of current study is nonclinical toxicology evaluation of vaccine through intra-nasal route, an alternate route apart from stipulated regulatory guidelines.

Methods: 67 health workers with biological risk in their tasks, who have been filed as non-responders to conventional vaccination against Hepatitis B, were enrolled in the Clinical Trial. All participants were from 18 years up to 64 years old. Inclusion Criteria: NHS workers -including university students doing their internships in health centres dependent on the National Health System (inclusion of students is regulated and limited by specific instructions on labour prevention in each autonomous community)- classified as non-responders. The criteria defining them as non-responders to the conventional hepatitis B vaccine is anti HBsAb titers < 10 mUI/ml following the application of six doses of conventional vaccine at 20 mu g doses (two complete guidelines). The objective of this study was to provide Health workersstaff with an additional protection tool against hepatitis B infection, and to evaluate the efficacy of the adjuvanted vaccine in healthy non-responders to conventional hepatitis B vaccine. The primary outcome was the measurement of antibody antiHBs before the first Fendrix (R) dose and a month after the administration of each dose. Other outcome was collection of adverse effects during administration and all those that could be related to the vaccine and that occur within 30 days after each dose. In this study, only one group was assigned. There was no randomization or masking. Results: The participants were recruited between April 13, 2018 and October 31, 2019. 67 participants were enrolled in the Clinical Trial and included the analyses. The primary immunisation consists of 4 separate 0.5 ml doses of Fendrix (R), administered at the following schedule: 1 month, 2 months and 6 months from the date of the first dose. Once the positivity was reached in any of the doses, the participant finished the study and was not given the following doses. 68.66% (46 out 67) had a positive response to first dose of Fendrix (R). 57.14% (12 out 21) had a positive response to second dose of Fendrix (R). 22.22% (2 out 9) had a positive response to third dose of Fendrix and 42.96% (3 out 7) had a positive response to last dose of Fendrix (R). Overall, 94.02% (64 out 67) of participants had a positive response to Fendrix (R). No serious adverse event occurred. Conclusions: The use of Fendrix (R), is a viable vaccine alternative for NHS workers classified as ''non-responders". Revaccination of healthy non-responders with Fendrix (R), resulted in very high proportions of responders without adverse events. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The impact of the changing pneumococcal national immunisation program among older Australians	VACCINE			English	Article						Pneumococcal vaccination; Invasive pneumococcal disease; IPD; Indigenous; Non-Indigenous; Adult; Conjugate vaccine; Polysaccharide vaccine; Australia	PNEUMONIA; DISEASE; COMMUNITY; VACCINE; RISK	Australia has a universal infant pneumococcal conjugate vaccination program and until recently a universal pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine program for non-Indigenous adults aged >= 65 years and Indigenous adults aged >= 50 years. We documented the impacts of infant and adult vaccination programs on the epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in Indigenous and non-Indigenous adults. IPD notifications from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System were analysed from 2002 to 2017, grouped by age, vaccine serotype group and Indigenous status. Since the universal funding of infant and elderly pneumococcal vaccination programs in January 2005, total IPD decreased by 19% in non-Indigenous adults aged >65 years but doubled in Indigenous adults aged >50 years. Vaccine uptake was suboptimal in both groups but lower in Indigenous adults. IPD due to the serotypes contained in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) except for serotype 3 declined markedly over the study period but were replaced by non-PCV serotypes. Serotype 3 is currently the most common in older adults. In the populations eligible for the adult 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) program, IPD rates due to its exclusive serotypes increased to a lower extent than non-vaccine types. In 2017, non-vaccine serotypes accounted for most IPD in the older population eligible for the 23vPPV program, while it's eleven exclusive serotypes accounted for the majority of IPD in younger adults. Infant and adult pneumococcal vaccination programs in Australia have shaped the serotype-specific epidemiology of IPD in older adults. IPD remains a significant health burden for the Indigenous population. Herd immunity impact is clear for PCV serotypes excluding serotype 3 and serotype replacement is evident for non-PCV serotypes. The adult 23vPPV immunisation program appears to have partially curbed replacement with IPD due to its eleven exclusive serotypes, highlighting a potential benefit of increasing adult 23vPPV coverage in Australia.

In Spain, most IMD cases are caused by meningococcal serogroup B (MenB). This study estimates its economic burden from a societal perspective in Spain. Methods: A previously published bottom-up, model-based incidence costing approach by Scholz et al. (2019) to estimate the economic burden of MenB in Germany was adapted to the Spanish setting. Diagnosis and age-related costs for a hypothetical Spanish cohort were calculated over a lifetime horizon. Official Spanish databases, literature and expert opinion were used as data sources. The costs were updated to 2019 prices, and a 3% discount rate was applied. Direct costs related to the acute IMD phase, long-term sequelae, rehabilitation and public health response were considered. Indirect costs included productivity losses and premature mortality and were calculated using the human-capital approach (HCA) and friction-cost approach (FCA). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed. Result: At base-case, the total cost for a cohort of 142 patients (2017-2018 period) was (sic)4.74 million ((sic)33,484/case) using the FCA and 613.14 million ((sic)92,768/case) using the HCA. Direct costs amounted to 64.65 million ((sic)32,765/case). Sequelae costs represented (sic)2.46% of the total cost using the FCA and 77.63% using the HCA. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that variation of +/- 20% in the input parameter values (population, epidemiology, productivity, costs) had the greatest influence on the base-case results, and the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed the probability of fitting base-case estimates was > 99%, both for FCA and HCA. Discussion: MenB IMD is an uncommon but severe disease, with a high economic burden for Spanish society. The elevated costs per IMD case reflect its severity in each patient suffering this disease, especially due to the development of sequelae. (C) 2021 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A.

Leprosy is a spectral disease for which the clinical outcome after M. leprae infection is determined by host factors. The spectrum spans from anti-inflammatory T helper-2 (Th2) immunity concomitant with large numbers of bacteria as well as antibodies against M. leprae antigens in multibacil-lary (MB) leprosy, to paucibacillary (PB) leprosy characterised by strong pro-inflammatory, Th1 as well as Th17 immunity. Despite decades of availability of adequate antibiotic treatment, transmission of M. leprae is unabated. Since individuals with close and frequent contact with untreated leprosy patients are particularly at risk to develop the disease themselves, prophylactic strategies currently focus on household contacts of newly diagnosed patients. It has been shown that BCG (re)vaccination can reduce the risk of leprosy. However, BCG immunopro-phylaxis in contacts of leprosy patients has also been reported to induce PB leprosy, indicating that BCG (re)vaccination may tip the balance between protective immunity and overactivation immunity causing skin/nerve tissue damage. In order to identify who is at risk of developing PB leprosy after BCG vaccination, amongst individuals who are chronically exposed to M. leprae, we analyzed innate and adaptive immune markers in whole blood of household contacts of newly diagnosed leprosy patients in Bangladesh, some of which received BCG vaccination. As controls, individuals from the same area without known contact with leprosy patients were similarly assessed. Our data show the added effect of BCG vaccination on immune markers on top of the effect already induced by M. leprae exposure. Moreover, we identified BCG-induced markers that differentiate between protective and disease prone immunity in those contacts. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
