The parenteral route of drug administration is a vital healthcare procedure used in the administration of medicines using needle and syringe. Despite the importance of this procedure, improper handling of the device has resulted in an unsafe practice among health workers who attend to patients receiving injectable medications. A phased measles vaccination campaign (MVC) was conducted in 2017/2018 with a key objectives of training health workers on injection safety. This paper examines the association between improvement on knowledge of health workers through improved training curriculum and their practice on injection safety. Methods: We reviewed information on handling and administration of the measles vaccine from the open data kit (ODK) platform finalised microplans and the training curriculum used during the 2015/2016 and 2017/2018 MVC. We analysed our results using paired t-test analysis, SPSS and Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and reported results in frequencies and proportions using charts and tables. Results: Our findings revealed more health workers were trained during the 2017/2018 MVC as compared to 2015/2016 MVC. The curriculum adopted during the 2017/2018 MVC showed that multiple techniques were adopted during training compared to only class lectures used during the 2015/2016 MVC. A paired t-test analysis comparing the impact of training on the knowledge of the health workers during 2015/2016 and 2017/2018 MVC revealed significant improvement across five states during the 2017/2018 MVC, with mean ranging from 6.5% in the FCT to 23.7% in Nassarawa state. Conclusion: The review of training curriculum and use of multiple training styles during the 2017/2018 MVC improved the knowledge of health workers. Immunisation programmes will benefit from adopting the training curriculum to meet the specific needs of the health workers. (C) 2021 World Health Organization. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Feasibility of age- and gestation-based routine universal influenza vaccines schedules for children aged 6 months-2 years and pregnant women	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza; Immunisation; Vaccination schedule; Year-round; Young children; Pregnancy; High income countries; Antenatal care; Hong Kong	VACCINATION; IMMUNIZATION; SEASONALITY; FORMULATION; INFECTION; RESPONSES; VIRUS	Background: Hong Kong's seasonal influenza schedule follows the World Health Organization's northern hemisphere vaccine composition recommendations but with year-round influenza activity there is the potential to implement routine age-and gestation-based schedules utilising both northern and southern hemisphere vaccines for children aged 6 months to 2 years and for pregnant women. This study assessed the potential feasibility of such schedules. Methods: A literature review was conducted and in-depth interviews with vaccine experts, policy makers and nurses were undertaken. Results: The following schedules were proposed and assessed for perceived feasibility: 1) a four-dose schedule in the first two years of life requiring an additional unscheduled clinic visit at 7 months; 2) a three-dose schedule excluding the 4-week booster after the first dose; 3) a two-dose schedule for pregnant women involving a dose at the booking visit and a dose with pertussis vaccine at 7 months gestation; and 4) a one-dose schedule at 7 months gestation. Conclusions: Age-and gestation-based routine influenza vaccination schedules are theoretically feasible for both young children and pregnant women. The three-dose paediatric and one-dose obstetric schedules were assessed in interviews with vaccine experts, policy makers and nurses to be most acceptable. Further clinical studies are required to determine whether such schedules are non-inferior to current seasonal-based schedules in terms of vaccine effectiveness and vaccine uptake.

When there are no appropriate antiviral and associated therapies available, vaccine development becomes even more essential. Therefore, in the present study, a variety of immunoinformatics techniques was utilized to develop a novel multi-epitope vaccine that targets the highly immunodominant type 3 fimbrial protein of Klebsiella pneumoniae, the causal organism for pneumonia. The putative B and T cell epitopes were predicted from the protein and screened for antigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, and cross-reactivity with human proteomes. Subsequently, the selected epitopes were joined with the help of linkers to form a robust vaccine construct. In addition, an adjuvant was applied to the N-terminal of the construct to improve the immunogenicity of the vaccine. The physicochemical properties, solubility, the secondary and tertiary structure of the final vaccine were also established. MD simulations for 100 ns were employed to assess the stability of the vaccine-TLR-2 docked complex. The final vaccine was optimized and cloned in pET28a (+) vector with His-tag to achieve maximum vaccine protein expression for ease of purification. Immune simulation results indicated the potency of this vaccine candidate as a probable therapeutic agent. In conclusion, the overall results of various immunoinformatics tools and methods employed revealed that the constructed multi-epitope vaccine exhibits a high potential for stimulating both B and T-cells immune responses against pneumonia infection. However, experimental immunological studies are required to corroborate the viability of the novel multi-epitope construct as a commercial vaccine. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bozorgi, A; Fahimnia, B				Bozorgi, Ali; Fahimnia, Behnam			Micro array patch (MAP) for the delivery of thermostable vaccines in Australia: A cost/benefit analysis	VACCINE			English	Article							MICRONEEDLE-PATCH; INVENTORY MODEL; COLD CHAIN; ACCEPTABILITY; VACCINATION; IMPACT	Background: It is anticipated that transforming the vaccine supply chain from syringe-and-needle to thermostable vaccines enabled by Micro Array Patch (MAP) will result in reduced supply chain costs as well as reduced wastes (environmental impact) and improved safety. This paper provides a thorough cost comparison of the conventional syringe-and-needle vaccine supply chain versus the MAP vaccine supply chain for influenza vaccine delivery in Australia. Objective: To determine the potential cost implications and general benefits of replacing syringe-and-needle flu vaccine with MAP-enabled thermostable flu vaccine in Australia. Methods: We first provide a snapshot of the existing flu vaccine supply chain in Australia including its limitations and opportunities for improvement. Data/information is collected through interviewing the key stakeholders across vaccine supply chain including vaccine manufacturers, logistics providers, clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies. A cost/benefit analysis of the anticipated supply chain of the MAP-enabled vaccine will reveal the opportunities and challenges of supply chain transformation for flu vaccine delivery in Australia. Findings: Our high-level practice-informed cost/benefit analysis identifies cold chain removal as an important source of cost saving, but administrative cost savings appear to be even more significant (e.g., time saving for nurses and those involved in cold chain management). Our analysis also identifies the key benefits and limitations of vaccine supply chain transformation in Australia. Conclusion: We conclude that the benefits of moving from syringe-and-needle vaccines to thermostable MAP-delivered vaccines are beyond transportation and storage cost saving. Potential benefits through cost saving, waste reduction, and service level improvement are discussed along with various safety and wellbeing consequences as well as directions for future research in this area.

Many women do not receive vaccines recommended during pregnancy; conversely, inadvertent exposure to vaccines contraindicated or not recommended during pregnancy may occur. We assessed exposure to two recommended vaccines and two vaccines not recommended during pregnancy among privately and Medicaid-insured women in the United States. Methods: This study includes a retrospective cohort of pregnancies in women aged 12-55 years resulting in live birth, spontaneous abortion, or stillbirth identified in the IBM (R) MarketScan (R) Commercial, Blue Health Intelligence (R) (BHI (R)) Commercial, and IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Databases from August 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. Gestational age at vaccination was determined using a validated algorithm. We examined vaccines (1) recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis [Tdap]; inactivated influenza) and (2) not recommended (human papillomavirus [HPV]) or contraindicated (measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR]). Results: We identified 496,771 (MarketScan Commercial), 858,961 (BHI), and 289,573 (MarketScan Medicaid) pregnancies (approximately 75% aged 20-34 years). Across these three databases, 52.1%, 50.3%, and 31.3% of pregnancies, respectively, received Tdap, most often at a gestational age of 28 weeks, and influenza vaccination occurred in 32.1%, 30.8%, and 18.0% of pregnancies, respectively. HPV vaccination occurred in < 0.2% of pregnancies, mostly in the first trimester among women aged 12-19 years, and MMR was administered in < 0.1% of pregnancies. Use of other contraindicated vaccines per ACIP (e.g., varicella, live attenuated influenza) was rare. Conclusion: Maternal vaccination with ACIP-recommended vaccines was suboptimal among privately and Medicaid-insured patients, with lower vaccination coverage among Medicaid-insured pregnancies than their privately insured counterparts. Inadvertent exposure to contraindicated vaccines during pregnancy was rare. This study evaluated only vaccinations reimbursed among insured populations and may have limited generalizability to uninsured populations. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yoshikawa, T				Yoshikawa, Tomoki			Third-generation smallpox vaccine strain-based recombinant vaccines for viral hemorrhagic fevers	VACCINE			English	Review						Vaccinia virus; Viral hemorrhagic fever; Recombinant vaccine	VIRUS PROPAGATION; RHESUS-MONKEYS; YELLOW-FEVER; CELL-CULTURE; LASSA FEVER; GUINEA-PIGS; MVA; SAFETY; PROTECTION; IMMUNOGENICITY	Vaccinia virus has been used as a smallpox vaccine. Now that smallpox has been eradicated, the vaccinia virus is expected to be used as a bioterrorism countermeasure and a recombinant vaccine vector for other infectious diseases, such as viral hemorrhagic fevers. Many vaccinia virus strains were used as smallpox vaccines in the smallpox eradication campaign coordinated by the World Health Organization. These strains can be classified into generations, according to the history of improving production methods and efforts to reduce the adverse reactions. Significantly, the third-generation of smallpox vaccine strains, which include modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and LC16m8, are currently popular as recombinant vac-cine vectors due to their well-balanced safety and immunogenicity profiles. The present review firstly focuses on the characteristics of the smallpox vaccine generations. The historical background of the development of the third-generation smallpox vaccine strains is detailed, along with the history of the transition of the vaccinia virus generation used as vectors for hemorrhagic fever vaccines to the third gen-eration. Among the vaccinia viruses, MVA is currently the most commonly used vector for developing hemorrhagic fever vaccines, including dengue fever, yellow fever, Ebola viral disease, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. LC16m8 is a vaccine candidate for severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. The current status and recent advances in the development of these hem-orrhagic fever vaccines using third-generation vaccinia strains are discussed. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

COVID-19 vaccination in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, December 2020-April 2021	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19 vaccine; SARS-CoV-2; Federal Bureau of Prisons	UNITED-STATES; SEPTEMBER	Objectives: To describe COVID-19 vaccine distribution operations in United States Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) institutions and offices from December 16, 2020-April 14, 2021, report vaccination coverage among staff and incarcerated people, and identify factors associated with vaccination acceptance among incarcerated people. Methods: The BOP COVID-19 vaccination plan and implementation timeline are described. Descriptive statistics and vaccination coverage were calculated for the BOP incarcerated population using data from the BOP electronic medical record. Coverage among staff was calculated using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Vaccination Administration Management System. Vaccination coverage in the BOP versus the overall United States adult population was compared by state/territory. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were developed to identify demographic, health-related, and institution-level factors associated with vaccination acceptance among incarcerated people, using hierarchical linear modeling to account for institution-level clustering. Results: By April 14, 2021, BOP had offered COVID-19 vaccination to 37,870 (100%) staff and 88,173/126,413 (69.8%) incarcerated people, with acceptance rates of 50.2% and 64.2%, respectively. At the time of analysis, vaccination coverage in BOP was comparable to coverage in the overall adult population in the states and territories where BOP institutions and offices are located. Among incarcerated people, factors associated with lower vaccination acceptance included younger age, female sex, non Hispanic Black and Asian race/ethnicity, and having few underlying medical conditions; factors associated with higher acceptance included having a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, being born outside the United States, and being assigned to a Federal Detention Center. Conclusions: Early COVID-19 vaccination efforts in BOP have achieved levels of coverage similar to the general population. To build on this initial success, BOP can consider strategies including re-offering vaccination to people who initially refused and tailoring communication strategies to groups with lower acceptance rates.

Vaccine preventable diseases surveillance in Nepal: How much does it cost?	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine preventable diseases; Surveillance; Cost; Polio transition; Nepal; Country study		Assessing the cost of vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) surveillance is becoming more important in the context of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) funding transition, since GPEI support to polio surveillance helped the incremental building of VPD surveillance systems in many countries, including low income countries such as Nepal. However, there is limited knowledge on the cost of conducting VPD surveillance, especially the national cost for surveillance of multiple vaccine-preventable diseases. The current study sought to calculate the economic and financial costs of Nepal's comprehensive VPD surveillance systems from July 2016 to July 2017. At thecentral level, all surveillance units were included in the sample. At sub-national level, a purposive sampling strategy was used to select a representative sample from locations involved in conducting surveillance. The sub-national sample costs were extrapolated to the nationwide VPD surveillance system. Nepal's total annual economic cost of VPD surveillance was USD 4.81 million or USD 0.18 per capita, while the total financial cost was USD 4.38 million or USD 0.16 per capita. Government expenditures accounted for 56% of the total economic cost, and World Health Organization accounting for 44%. The biggest cost driver was personnel accounting for 51% of the total economic cost. WHO supported trained surveillance personnel through donor funding, mainly from Global Polio Eradication Initiative. As a polio transition priority country, Nepal will need to make strategic choices to fully self-finance or seek full donor support or a mixed-financing model as polio program funding diminishes.

A subsequent national review made seven recommendations to improve vaccine pharmacovigilance. Ten years on, in advance of implementing the COVID-19 immu-nisation program, we evaluated views on the capacity of Australia's vaccine pharmacovigilance system to promptly detect, examine and communicate a signal. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted between July and October 2020 with individuals with expertise in vaccine safety in Australia using an interview guide informed by key Australian and international frameworks. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analy-sis was used to code data using a deductive approach. Results: Interviews with seventeen participants enabled six themes to be identified. Participants described improvement and significant innovation within Australia's vaccine pharmacovigilance system over the decade since 2010, particularly through establishment of a new active, cohort event monitoring system using short message service surveys. Participants thought Australia had a good foundation for COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance; implementation of the COVID-19 immunisation program was seen as a potential driver for ongoing enhancement through: a) improved integration of the active surveillance and spontaneous reporting systems, and; b) development of population-level active surveillance, includ-ing through data linkage. Transparent communication was considered essential to address the unprece-dented challenges of COVID-19 and broader vaccine safety concerns. Conclusions: Vaccine safety experts in Australia convey confidence in the innovative pharmacovigilance systems implemented over the past 10 years. While Australia has a multifaceted system incorporating both active surveillance and spontaneous reporting systems, COVID-19 vaccine implementation repre-sents an opportunity to enhance current systems and to develop new, systematic approaches to vaccine pharmacovigilance that should make both a local and global contribution.

This study analyzed changes in serotype distribution through serotyping, multilocus sequence typing, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 168 pediatric IPD isolates obtained from a multihospital-based surveillance system during 2014-2019 in South Korea. Vaccine serotypes (VTs) accounted for 16.1% (19A, 10.1%; 6A, 1.8%; and 19F 1.8%), 82.1% were NVTs (10A, 23.8%; 15A, 8.3%; 12F, 6.5%; 15C, 6.5%; and 15B, 6.0%), and three (1.8%) were nontypeable. Serotype 10A was the most com-mon serotype, with a significant increase from 11.5% in 2014 to 33.3% in 2019 (p < 0.05 for the trend). Other NVTs decreased from 70.4% to 41.7% between 2015 and 2019, most notably in serotype 12F (from 14.8% to 0%). Almost all (95.0%) serotype 10A isolates were ST11189, which were multidrug resistant.

Predictors of hepatitis A immunity in adults in California in order to better utilize hepatitis A vaccine	VACCINE			English	Article						Hepatitis A vaccine; Immunity	UNITED-STATES; VIRUS-INFECTION; IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES; ADVISORY-COMMITTEE; PREVENTION; RECOMMENDATIONS; SEROPREVALENCE; ADOLESCENTS; ANTIBODIES; OUTBREAK	Background: Hepatitis A vaccine recommendations now include homelessness, illegal drug use, and HIV, as well as traditional risk factors and travel to areas endemic for hepatitis A. We examined a large diverse population for predictors of Hepatitis A immunity in order to better utilize Hepatitis A vaccine. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional descriptive study of members of a large integrated health plan with a test for Hepatitis A Immunoglobulin G (IgG) between January 1st, 2007, and December 31st, 2017. Exclusion criteria included age <18 years, <6 months of continuous enrollment, and Hepatitis A vaccine prior to Hepatitis A test. Variables of interest were age, gender, primary language spoken, ethnicity/race, neighborhood household income, and history of travel or history of jaundice. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association of risk factors on Hepatitis A immunity. Results: Of the 318,170 persons > 18 years tested for Hepatitis A immunity, 155, 842 persons had a reactive Hepatitis A IgG test (49%). The lowest prevalence was for Whites at 28.1% followed by Blacks at 35.8%. Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islanders had prevalence rates of 63% and 68.2% respectively. In adjusted analyses, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Hispanics and Blacks were 5.17, 3.44 and 1.42 times more likely to have Hepatitis A immunity than Whites. Those that spoke Spanish or language other than English or Spanish as their primary preferred language were 6.11 and 3.27 time more likely to have immunity than English speakers. Known travel history conferred a 2.16 likelihood of Hepatitis A immunity. Conclusions: Persons of Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander background as well as persons with a preferred spoken language other than English have a high prevalence of Hepatitis A immunity. Testing for Hepatitis A immunity prior to vaccination should be considered for these groups. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Point-of-care vaccinators' perceptions of vaccine hesitancy drivers: A qualitative study from the cape metropolitan district, South Africa	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine hesitancy; Immunization; Vaccination; Interviews; Thematic analysis; Cape Metro	CHILDHOOD VACCINATION; WEB 2.0; COVERAGE; IMMUNIZATION	Background: Vaccination coverage remains suboptimal in many parts of the world, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), including South Africa. Vaccine hesitancy, a recognized factor contributing to low vaccination uptake in many parts of the world, is suspect in the suboptimal vaccination coverage level in South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape Province. We aimed to investigate vaccine hesitancy and to describe point-of-care vaccinators' perceptions of the drivers of vaccine hesitancy in the Cape Metropolitan District, South Africa (Cape Metro). We conducted in-depth interviews with 19 point-of-care vaccinators in 16 purposively selected healthcare facilities in the Cape Metro between September and November 2019. Participants were sampled purposively as 'rich cases' who had been delivering vaccination services for at least five years post qualification. We organized the data thematically in ATLAS.ti and report findings thematically by the types of reasons participants reported for vaccine hesitancy amongst clients. Findings: Of the 19 interviewees, 11 (59%) reported having encountered vaccine-hesitant clients at some point in their careers. Reasons reported for vaccine hesitancy by clients included: (a) religion, (b) internet misinformation, (c) concern over causing the child pain, (d) natural immunity development, and (e) concern about possible adverse effect following immunization. Vaccine hesitancy in the Cape Metro cuts across all socio-economic classes. Also, some communities perceived to be vaccine-hesitant were mentioned by the participants in this study. Conclusions: Attitude towards vaccination are generally positive in the Cape Metro. However, vaccine hesitancy is present. The issues of vaccine hesitancy at the reported levels can still be mitigated by continuous health education in the clinics and communities, as well as stakeholder engagement as suggested by the point-of-care vaccinators in the Cape Metro.

A closer look at state and region-specific coverage is necessary to identify potentially modifiable disparities. Using ArcGIS software, we identify geospatial variation in HPV vaccine coverage in the state of Virginia and examine the relationship between various socio-demographic indicators and HPV vaccination uptake. HPV vaccination rates among adolescents 11 to 17 years as of 07/01/2018 were retrieved at the zip-code level from the Virginia Immunization Information System and chloropleth maps produced. The ArcGIS Hot Spot Analysis tool identified spatial clusters of zip codes with high and low vaccination rates. Population characteristics and socioeconomic indicators were retrieved from the 2010 United States Census and compared between statistically significant clusters of higher or lower than expected vaccination rates. Regions with significantly lower initiation rates were less populated, less educated, and had a lower median household income (MHI) with higher rates of poverty and unemployment. Among male adolescents, these areas had a significantly lower density of primary care providers and smaller African American and Hispanic populations. In contrast, regions with significantly lower series completion were more populated and had a higher MHI, but there was no difference in provider density or minority population. Ultimately, regional socioeconomic indicators are significant predictors of HPV vaccination, but have contrasting implications for series initiation and completion. Targeted interven-tions and safety net programs have traditionally focused on the socioeconomically disadvantaged, how-ever it is the more affluent communities that may be struggling with series completion.

Racial disparities in influenza immunization during pregnancy in the United States: A narrative review of the evidence for disparities and potential interventions	VACCINE			English	Review							VACCINE PROMOTION PACKAGE; MATERNAL INFLUENZA; TDAP VACCINATION; IMPROVING INFLUENZA; SEASONAL INFLUENZA; RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; DECISION-MAKING; BIRTH OUTCOMES; FLU VACCINE	Objective: The objectives of this review were to summarize existing data on racial disparities in maternal immunization for influenza in the U.S. and to review the literature on interventions to improve the uptake of the influenza vaccine among Black pregnant women. Data Sources: U.S. survey data on maternal influenza immunization by racial and ethnic group were summarized in narrative form. To review intervention studies, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for English language articles published 2017 to 2021, in addition to studies identified by a previous systematic review. Study Eligibility Criteria: Peer-reviewed studies conducted in the U.S. and reporting interventions designed to increase the uptake of the influenza vaccine in pregnancy with study populations including at least 20% of participants identifying as Black were included. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: Studies were grouped and reviewed in a narrative manner according to whether they were conducted in predominantly Black populations or in more racially diverse populations, and whether they tested multicomponent or single-component interventions. Results: A decade of survey data show that Black women in the U.S. consistently have the lowest rate of influenza immunization in pregnancy. Black women report a lower rate of being recommended or offered the vaccine, and provider recommendation is associated with greater vaccine uptake. Intervention studies to increase influenza immunization among Black pregnant women have reported mixed results. Successful interventions include multicomponent practice-based interventions, group prenatal care, and culturally competent patient educational messages. Conclusions: Racial disparities in maternal uptake of the influenza vaccine are long-standing, but not intractable. More research is needed to test interventions to address this disparity, with a focus on increasing provider recommendation and offer of the vaccine, addressing patients' concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy, improving providers' cultural competence, and building trust between providers and patients.

Mothers lacking adequate immunity and contracting the disease represent the biggest risk of transmission to new-borns, for which the disease is often a threat. The aim of the study was to estimate the frequency of pertussis susceptibility among pregnant women, in order to point out the need for a vaccine recall during pregnancy, and to evaluate the antibody response in already vaccinated women. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the blood test centre of "St. Anna" Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital in Turin (Piedmont, Italy). Eligibility criteria included pregnant women coming to the centre for any blood test, aged 18 or above and with gestational age between 33 and 37 weeks at the moment of the blood draw. The data collection was carried out from May 2019 to January 2020 and the concentration of anti-Pertussis Toxin (anti-PT) IgG was measured through the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) technique. Two-hundred women (median age 35) were enrolled: 132 (66%) had received at least one dose of pertussis vaccine, 82 of which during pregnancy. Recently vaccinated women had significantly higher antibody titres (even 12-15 times as high) compared to those vaccinated more than 5 years before or never vaccinated at all (p < 0.0001). Moreover, 95.1% of recently vaccinated women had anti-PT IgG levels above 10 IU/ml, and 85.4% above 20 IU/ml, while the same proportions were as low as 37% and 21% (respectively) in the group of women not vaccinated in pregnancy. This study confirmed that the vaccination is greatly effective in ensuring high antibody titres in the first months after the booster vaccine, with considerable differences in anti-PT IgG compared to women vaccinated earlier or never vaccinated at all, and therefore vaccinating pregnant women against pertussis still represents a valuable strategy.

The American Red Cross has developed a 5-Point Plana to geolocate under-vaccinated children and determine the reasons why they miss vaccination by capitalizing on the Red Cross Movement's large cadres of trusted community volunteers. The Plan was piloted in Bobasi sub-county in Western Kenya, with volunteers seeking to conduct a face-to-face interview in all households, visiting over 60,000 over 7 days. Six pockets of 233 children without a home-based vaccination record or missing an age appropriate dose of Penta1, Penta3 or measles-containing vaccine were identified. Three activities were carried out to learn why these children were not vaccinated: 1) one-on-one interviews and 2) focus group discussions with the caregivers of the under-vaccinated children and 3) interviews with healthcare workers who vaccinate in Bobasi. Complacency was commonly reported by caregivers during one-on-one interviews while bad staff attitude or practice was most frequently reported in focus group discussions; health staff reported caregiver hesitency, not knowing vaccination due date and vaccine stock-outs as the most common reasons for caregivers to not have their child vaccinated. As reasons varied across the three different activities, the different perspectives and approaches helped characterize vaccination barriers. Civil society organizations working together with the Ministry of Health can provide valuable information for immunization managers to act on. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Human papillomavirus prevalence and risk factors among Australian women 9-12 years after vaccine program introduction	VACCINE			English	Article							NATURAL-HISTORY; CERVICAL-CANCER; HPV; INFECTION; DNA; AMPLIFICATION; COVERAGE; IMMUNITY; ASSAY	Background: In Australia, high and widespread uptake of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has led to substantial population-level reductions in the prevalence of quadrivalent vaccine targeted HPV genotypes 6/11/16/18 in women aged <= 35 years. We assessed risk factors for HPV detection among 18-35 year old women, 9-12 years after vaccine program introduction. Methods: Women attending health services between 2015 and 2018 provided a self-collected vaginal specimen for HPV genotyping (Roche Linear Array) and completed a questionnaire. HPV vaccination status was validated against the National Register. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for factors associated with HPV detection. Results: Among 1564 women (median age 24 years; IQR 21-27 years), Register-confirmed >= 1-dose vaccine coverage was highest at 69.3% and 68.1% among women aged 18-21 and 22-24 years respectively, decreasing to 42.9% among those aged 30-35 years. Overall prevalence of quadrivalent vaccine-targeted HPV types was very low (2.0%; 95% CI: 1.4-2.8%) and influenced only by vaccination status (5.5% among unvaccinated compared with 0.7% among vaccinated women; aOR = 0.13 (95% CI: 0.05-0.30)). Prevalence of remaining HPV types, at 40.4% (95% CI: 38.0-42.9%), was influenced by established risk factors for HPV infection; younger age-group (p-trend < 0.001), more recent (p < 0.001) and lifetime sexual partners (ptrend < 0.001), but not vaccination status. Prevalence of HPV31/33/45, which shared risk factors with that of non-vaccine targeted HPV types, was also lower among vaccinated (4%) compared with unvaccinated (7%) women (aOR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.29-0.89), indicative of cross-protection. Conclusion: Vaccination has changed the epidemiology of HPV infection in Australian women, having markedly reduced the prevalence of vaccine-targeted types, including amongst women with known risk factors for infection. Vaccinated women appear to be benefiting from modest cross-protection against types 31/33/45 afforded by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. These results reinforce the importance of HPV vaccination.

Understanding how these factors affect mortality estimates is crucial, especially in the context of public health decision making. We examine how the quality of the studies selected to provide mortality data, influence estimates of burden and provide recommendations about the inclusion of studies and datasets to calculate mortality estimates. Methods: To determine how mortality estimates are affected by the data used to generate model outputs, we compared the studies used by The Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and Maternal and Child Epidemiology Estimation (MCEE) modelling groups to generate enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Shigella-associated mortality estimates for 2016. Guided by an expert WHO Working Group, we applied a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to evaluate the quality of studies used by both modelling groups. Results: IHME and MCEE used different sets of ETEC and Shigella studies in their models and the majority of studies were high quality. The distribution of the NOS scores was similar between the two modelling groups. We observed an overrepresentation of studies from some countries in SEAR, AFR and WPR compared to other WHO regions. Conclusion: We identified key differences in study inclusion and exclusion criteria used by IHME and MCEE and discuss their impact on datasets used to generate diarrhoea-associated mortality estimates. Based on these observations, we provide a set of recommendations for future estimates of mortality associated with enteric diseases. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Relationship between pre-existing allergies and anaphylactic reactions post mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administration	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; mRNA vaccine; Anaphylaxis following COVID-19 vaccine		Two mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, are approved for emergency use in the United States. After their approval and dosing in millions of recipients, reports of anaphylaxis began to appear in the Vaccine Adverse Reporting System (VAERS). Here we provide an analysis of the relationship between prior history of allergy and/or anaphylaxis and anaphylaxis rates following the administration of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Overall reported incidence of anaphylaxis was estimated to be rare at 4.2 cases per million doses. It appeared that the relative incidence of anaphylaxis following administration of these COVID-19 vaccines was two and seven times higher for recipients with a prior history of allergies and/or anaphylaxis, respectively. This report provides valuable metrics to make evidence-based decisions for subjects with pre-existing allergic conditions receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bellier, L; Petitjean, A; Sarazu, T; Tresierra, J; Lopez, JG				Bellier, Lucile; Petitjean, Audrey; Sarazu, Tatiana; Tresierra, Julio; Guillermo Lopez, Juan			Cost-effectiveness analysis of switching from a trivalent to a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in the Peruvian immunisation programme	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza; Vaccination; Switch to quadrivalent influenza vaccine; Cost-effectiveness; Decision-analytic model; Peru	PUBLIC-HEALTH IMPACT; BURDEN; ADULTS	Background: Seasonal influenza is an acute respiratory infection mostly caused by type A and B influenza viruses. The severe form of the infection can be life-threatening and lead to a significant burden. Vaccination is the most efficient way of preventing influenza infections and limit this burden. Objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of switching from a trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) to a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) in the vaccination programme in Peru, and to evaluate the health and economic impact of reaching the vaccination coverage rate targeted by the Ministry of Health. Methods: A decision-analytic static cost-effectiveness model, was adapted to the Peruvian setting under both payer and societal perspectives. Results: A switch from TIV to QIV would prevent 29,126 additional cases (including 12,815 consultations), 54 hospitalisations, and 23 deaths related to influenza, mostly in the population <2 years-old and >60 years-old. This would lead to a saving of US $505,206 under the payer perspective, that would partially offset the investment necessary to introduce QIV into the immunisation programme. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is $16,649 per QALYs gained. The main drivers of the model results were vaccine efficacy against influenza B viruses, degree of match, vaccines prices and proportion of cases attributable to influenza B. The robustness of the results seems satisfactory as QIV has the probability of being a cost-effective strategy of 83.8% (considering a threshold of three GDP per capita). Reaching the coverage targeted by the Ministry of Health would result in health benefits and disease management savings, and lower ICERs. Conclusion: Introducing QIV instead of TIV in the Peruvian immunisation programme is expected to be a cost-effective strategy, especially in younger children and the elderly. The benefit of QIV would be even more important if the coverage targeted by the Ministry of Health would be reached in the most vulnerable groups. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of introducing TCV separately for urban and rural areas of India. Methods: A decision analytic model was developed, using a societal perspective, to compare long-term costs and outcomes (3% discount rate) in a new-born cohort of 100,000 children immunized with or without TCV. Three vaccination scenarios were modelled, assuming the protective efficacy of TCV to last for 5, 10 and 15 years following immunization. Incidence of typhoid infection estimated under 'National Surveillance System for Enteric Fever' (NSSEFI)' was used. The prices of vaccine and cost of service delivery were included for vaccination arm. Both health system cost and out-of-pocket expenditures for treatment of typhoid illness and its complications was included. Results: TCV introduction in urban areas would result in prevention of 17% to 36% typhoid cases and deaths. With exclusion of indirect costs, the incremental cost per QALY gained was 151,346 (54,730- 307,975), 61,710 (-5250 to 163,283) and 45,188 (-17,069 to 141,093) for scenario 1, 2 and 3 respectively. While, with inclusion of indirect costs, all 3 scenarios were cost saving. Further, in rural areas, TCV is estimated to reduce the typhoid cases and deaths by 19% to 36%, with ICER (incremental cost per QALY gained) ranging from 2340 (1316-4370) to 3574 (2057-6691) thousand (inclusive of indirect costs) among the 3 vaccination scenarios. Conclusion: From a societal perspective, introduction of TCV is a cost saving strategy in urban India. Further, due to low incidence of typhoid infection, introduction of TCV is not cost-effective in rural settings of India. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

S. aureus immune escape is mediated by factors that preempt com-plement activation, destroy phagocytes, and modify B and T cell responses. One such factor, Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) encompasses five Immunoglobulin binding domains (IgBDs) that associ-ate with the Fcc domain to block phagocytosis. IgBDs also associate with Fab encoded by V(H)3 clan related genes. SpA binding to V(H)3-IgM that serves as a B cell receptor results in B cell expansion and secretion of antibodies with no specificity for S. aureus. SpA crosslinking of V(H)3-IgG and V(H)3-IgE bound to cognate receptors of mast cells and basophils promotes histamine release and anaphylaxis. Earlier work devel-oped a prototype variant SpA(KKAA) with four amino acid substitutions in each IgBD. When tested in animal models, SpA(KKAA) elicited neutralizing antibodies and protection against infection. We show here that SpA(KKAA) retains crosslinking activity for V(H)3-IgG and V(H)3-IgE. We use a rational approach to design and test 67 new SpA variants for loss of V(H)3 binding and anaphylactic activities. We identify two detox-ified candidates that elicit SpA-neutralizing antibodies and protect animals from S. aureus colonization and bloodstream infection. The new detoxified SpA candidates bear three instead of four amino acid sub-stitutions thus increasing the development of SpA-specific antibodies. We propose that detoxified SpA variants unable to crosslink V(H)3-idiotypic immunoglobulin may be suitably developed as clinical-grade vaccines for safety and efficacy testing in humans.

The impact of an educational forum intervention on East African mothers' HPV vaccine-related knowledge, attitudes, and intentions to vaccinate their adolescent children	VACCINE			English	Article						HPV vaccine; Immigrant; East African; Educational intervention; Community engagement; Mothers	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION; AGED 13-17 YEARS; RANDOMIZED INTERVENTION; UNITED-STATES; PARENTS; SOMALI; IMMUNIZATION; ACCEPTANCE; STRATEGIES; COVERAGE	Objective: HPV vaccine uptake in U.S. East African adolescents is low. We developed and evaluated a culturally-targeted interactive educational intervention for East African immigrant mothers to increase HPV-vaccine-related knowledge, attitudes, and intentions to vaccinate adolescent children. Methods: Eligible mothers had > 1 11-17-year-old child and reported all children's HPV vaccination status as unvaccinated or unknown. The intervention was delivered via 10 dinners in the Seattle metropolitan area (8 with the Somali community, 2 with the Ethiopian community). Educational presentations and pre/post-tests on knowledge, attitudes, and intentions were conducted in the participants' native language by a co-ethnic physician. Pre/post differences in responses were evaluated with McNemar's tests and GEE models. HPV vaccination uptake 6-months post-intervention was evaluated using state immunization registry data. Results: Of 115 participating mothers, most (84%) were Somali and < 40 years of age (60%). Median years of formal education was 8 (range 0-16), and 61% reported a household income <$25,000. Knowledge of HPV/HPV-vaccines was low pre-intervention, with correct responses ranging from 4% to 39% (61%-91% of responses were "not sure"); correct post-intervention responses ranged from 29% to 97%. Pre intervention, only 12% of mothers thought they had enough information to make a decision about vaccination, compared to 90% post-intervention. Pre-intervention, only 16% of mothers reported that they were somewhat or very likely to vaccinate their child, compared to 83% post-intervention. All pre/post comparisons were statistically significantly different (p < 0.0001). Although mothers were more likely to report correct HPV-related knowledge and positive vaccine attitudes and intentions post intervention, only two mothers' children initiated HPV vaccination within 6 months after the intervention. Conclusions: Results illustrate that a culturally targeted educational intervention effectively increased East African mothers' HPV vaccine-related knowledge, attitudes, and intentions to vaccinate their adolescent children. Future research should identify additional intervention components that can bridge the gap between intention and behavior to facilitate HPV vaccine uptake. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Barriers and activities to implementing or expanding influenza vaccination programs in low- and middle-income countries: A global survey	VACCINE			English	Article						Influenza; Vaccination; Policies; Pandemic preparedness; Seasonal influenza vaccines; Public health practice; Influenza vaccination programs	ACUTE RESPIRATORY ILLNESS; SEASONAL INFLUENZA; NATIONAL BURDEN; ECONOMIC BURDEN; LATIN-AMERICA; MORTALITY; HOSPITALIZATIONS; INFECTIONS; BANGLADESH; VACCINES	Introduction: Despite considerable global burden of influenza, few low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have national influenza vaccination programs. This report provides a systematic assessment of barriers to and activities that support initiating or expanding influenza vaccination programs from the perspective of in-country public health officials. Methods: Public health officials in LMICs were sent a web-based survey to provide information on barriers and activities to initiating, expanding, or maintaining national influenza vaccination programs. The survey primarily included Likert-scale questions asking respondent storank barriers and activities in five categories. Results: Of 109 eligible countries, 62% participated. Barriers to influenza vaccination programs included lack of data oncost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination programs (87%) and on influenza disease burden (84%), competing health priorities (80%), lack of public perceived risk from influenza (79%), need for better risk communication tools (77%), lack of financial support for influenza vaccine programs (75%), a requirement to use only WHO-prequalified vaccines (62%), and young children require two vaccine doses (60%). Activities for advancing influenza vaccination programs included educating healthcare workers (97%) and decision-makers (91%) on the benefits of influenza vaccination, better estimates of influenza disease burden (91%) and cost of influenza vaccination programs (89%), simplifying vaccine introduction by focusing on selected high-riskgroups(82%), developing tools toprioritize target populations(80%), improving availability of influenza diagnostic testing(79%), and developing collaborations with neighboring countries for vaccine procurement (74%) and regulatory approval (73%). Responses varied by country region and income status. Conclusions: Local governments and key international stakeholders can use the results of this survey to improve influenza vaccination programs in LMICs, which is a critical component of global pandemic preparedness for influenza and other pathogens such as corona viruses. Additionally, strategies to improve global influenza vaccination coverage should be tailored to country income level and geographic location. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An analysis of the Texas Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System	VACCINE			English	Article						Pharmacy vaccination; Influenza; Vaccination location; Texas Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance; System	ADULT VACCINATION; OLDER-ADULTS; IMPACT; LOCATIONS	Introduction: Vaccination helps to prevent influenza infection and reduce associated costs but the influ-enza vaccination rate in Texas for adults between the ages of 18 to 64 years old is the lowest in the US. Pharmacies and alternative locations have been shown to help increase vaccination rates but many adults still go unvaccinated. Objective: This research aims to determine the factors associated with obtaining influenza vaccination at the pharmacy compared to non-pharmacy locations in Texas. Method: This study used pooled Texas Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System datasets (2014 to 2018) for this assessment. The main outcome variable was categorized into pharmacy and non-pharmacy vac-cination locations and analyzed using a logistic regression analysis. Further statistical analysis was done using a multinomial logistic regression after re-categorizing the outcome variable into pharmacy, doctor office, and other locations. Result: Blacks were 63% (AOR 0.37, C.I. 0.26, 0.50) and Hispanics were 38% (AOR 0.62, C.I. 0.48, 0.80) less likely to receive influenza vaccinations at the pharmacy respectively when compared to Whites. Furthermore, those who did not live in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) were 33% (AOR 0.67, C.I 0.53, 0.84) less likely to receive influenza vaccinations at the pharmacy compared to those who lived an MSA. While there was no observed difference in the likelihood of receiving influenza vaccination, the unemployed population were 40% (AOR 1.40, C.I 1.15, 1.71) more likely to be vaccinated in the phar-macy compared to the employed population. Conclusion: There is potential for increased utilization of pharmacies as a source of influenza vaccination Texas. Racial differences exist both for receiving influenza vaccinations and being vaccinated in the pharmacy. Influenza vaccination advocacy and education efforts may be necessary to improve pharmacy-based vaccination in Texas, especially for minorities and rural-dwelling Texans. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yamada, M; Li, MR; Iino, T				Yamada, Miki; Li, Mengran; Iino, Tomoharu			Pneumococcal vaccine coverage in Japan among patients with a history of splenectomy: Results of a retrospective administrative database study	VACCINE			English	Article						Pneumococcal vaccine; Coverage; Japan; Splenectomy; Pneumococcal infectious diseases; Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection	POSTSPLENECTOMY SEPSIS; INFECTION; RISK	Background: Splenectomy results in immune deficiency and increases the risk of clinically significant infections, termed overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI). In Japan, vaccination with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is covered by the Japanese National Health Insurance (NHI) for post-splenectomy patients, but there are limited data about whether these patients receive PPSV23 vaccination. Methods: We performed retrospective analyses of the JMDC Claims Database comprising employees (including some retired individuals) and their families in Japan. We identified patients who underwent splenectomy (registration period: January 1, 2005-June 30, 2019) at >= 2 to <= 64 years old, and obtained information about PPSV23 vaccination, reasons for splenectomy, and prevalence/complications of pneumococcal infectious diseases (including OPSI-related disorders). Results: Among 7,394,182 registered individuals, splenectomy was performed in 475, with an incidence rate of 1.6 cases per 100,000 person-years. Of 414 patients who underwent splenectomy at >= 2 to <= 64 years of age, their mean +/- standard deviation age was 45.4 +/- 15.7 years and 63.3% were 45-64 years old. Splenectomy was incidental in 55.3%. Overall, 123/414 patients were prescribed PPSV23 vaccination, resulting in vaccination coverage of 29.7%. The median interval from splenectomy to vaccination was 1.0 month (range: -1 to 85 months). Conclusion: This was the first study to document PPSV23 vaccination coverage after splenectomy in a Japanese real-world setting. PPSV23 coverage is quite low in Japan relative to that in other countries. (c) 2021 MSD K.K., Tokyo, Japan. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Haeder, SF				Haeder, Simon F.			Joining the herd? US public opinion and vaccination requirements across educational settings during the COVID-19 pandemic	VACCINE			English	Article						COVID-19; Vaccines; Mandates		With effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines beginning to be distributed across the United States, questions about who should receive the vaccine first have been the focus of public discussions. Yet, over the long-term, questions about the order of distribution will be displaced by questions about how to achieve high levels of vaccination rates. Historically, absent incentives or mandates, Americans have shown ambivalence, if not general antipathy, towards vaccinations, and vaccination rates have generally been low for many vaccines. There is evidence that vaccination requirements across educational settings are an effective policy instrument to increase vaccination rates. We administered a large national survey to assess American's attitudes towards vaccination requirements across three educational settings (daycare, K-12 schools, and universities) in general and for COVID-19 specifically. Partisanship, gender, race, rurality, and perceptions about the appropriate role schools should play in providing health services are substantive predictors of public opinion. While Americans generally support vaccination mandates across all three settings for both types of requirements, support is consistently and significantly lower for COVID19 requirements. The effect of partisanship is accentuated for COVID-19 requirements as compared to general requirements. Drop off in support between general and COVID-19 specific requirements are driven by partisanship, gender, political knowledge, rurality, and having children in the household. Nonetheless, mandates are supported by a majority of Americans. Assessing Americans' opinions of vaccination requirements in educational settings offers an important opportunity to explore the potential of mandates as policy instrument in the government's arsenal against COVID-19 and guide public policy on the issues.

Inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) may reduce the burden of influenza. Here, we report the results of a phase 3 clinical trial that evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of a novel QIV, GC3110A, in Korean children aged 6-35 months, which has been approved and is currently in use in Korea. The study involved two parts. In Part 1, the safety of GC3110A was evaluated in 10 subjects. After none of the subjects reported grade 3 adverse events (AEs), we proceeded to Part 2. Part 2 was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase 3 trial wherein we compared the immunogenicity and safety of GC3110A with those of a licensed control TIV. Immunogenicity was evaluated by measuring hemagglutination inhibition titers. The 200 participants enrolled in Part 2 were randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive GC3110A or control TIV. The study vaccine group met both primary (i.e., the lower limit of 95% confidence interval [CI] of the seroconversion rate exceeds 40% for four strains) and secondary (i.e., the lower limit of 95% CI of the seroprotection rate exceeds 70% for four strains) immunogenicity endpoints. There was no significant between-group difference in the seroconversion rate, seroprotection rate, and geometric mean titer for the shared strains. However, the study vaccine group demonstrated significantly higher immunity for the additional strain B/Yamagata. In the safety analysis, there was no significant between-group difference in the proportion of participants with solicited local AEs, solicited systemic AEs, and unsolicited AEs. In conclusion, the results indicate that GC3110A has comparable immunogenicity and safety to those of TIV. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Petteri			Heterologous boosting of nonrelated toxoid immunity during acute Puumala hantavirus infection	VACCINE			English	Article						Heterologous memory; Puumala virus; Antibody; Toxoid antigen; Tetanus; Pertussis; Vaccine		Persistence of immune memory in humans is a crucial yet poorly understood aspect of immunology. Here we have studied the effect of Puumala hantavirus infection on unrelated, pre-existing immune memory by studying T cell- and antibody responses against toxoid vaccine antigens of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis in a cohort of 45 patients. We found that tetanus- and pertussis-specific IgG concentrations elevate during acute Puumala virus infection. Increase in vaccine IgG was associated with proliferation of heterologous T cells. Interestingly, increases in tetanus-specific IgG persisted a year after the infection while pertussis-specific IgG declined rapidly; a difference in IgG kinetics resembling the difference seen after vaccination against tetanus and pertussis. These results suggest that persistence of immune memory is facilitated by heterologous boosting of old memory during memory formation against newly encountered antigens. They also show that different toxoid antigens may be treated differently. Our study gives new insight into how immune memory formation may alter pre-existing immune memory, and also shows that heterologous immunity may have an impact on vaccination outcomes.

The in vivo challenge results indicated that both vaccines induced a high heterologous virus neutralization test (VNT) titer by a single injection and successfully protected specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs from challenge infection. To determine the optimal vaccination age, a field trial with each vaccine was conducted with three one-shot-vaccinated groups that were injected at 8, 12, or 14 weeks of age and one two-shot-vaccinated group that was injected at 8 and 12 weeks of age in the pig farms. In these field trials, the improved serological performance at 20 and 24 weeks of age expected with vaccination at 12 or 14 weeks of age was not observed, although improved serological results were expected as the result of decreasing interference of maternally derived antibodies (MDAs), as MDAs waned with age. In addition, delayed vaccination resulted in MDA depletion at 14 weeks of age. Therefore, the optimal age for primary vaccination with two different formulated vaccines was 8 weeks old in pigs, considering that MDAs could provide a protective immunity against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) infection. Prolonged significantly higher VNT titers of immunized pigs were demonstrated in the two-shot-vaccinated groups. In total, the effectiveness of the two vaccines was demonstrated through efficacy tests and field trials in pigs. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For this reason, immunization using inactivated influenza vaccines is recommended for transplant patients, individuals receiving immunosuppressant treatments, and other persons with immunodeficiency. However, these immunocompromised populations are more likely to have lower and non-protective responses to annual vaccination with a standard influenza vaccine. Here, we review strategies aimed to improve the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in immunocompromised populations. The different strategies employed have included adjuvanted vaccines, high-dose vaccines, booster doses, intradermal vaccination, and temporary discontinuation of immunosuppressant treatment regimens. High-dose trivalent, inactivated, split-virus influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD) is so far one of the leading strategies for improving vaccine responses in HIV patients, transplant patients, and persons receiving immunosuppressant therapies for inflammatory diseases. Several studies in these populations have shown stronger humoral responses with IIV3-HD than existing standard-dose trivalent vaccine, and comparable safety. Accordingly, some scientific societies have stated that high-dose influenza vaccine could be a preferred option for immunocompromised patients. However, larger randomized controlled studies are needed to validate relative immunogenicity and safety of IIV3-HD and other enhanced vaccines and vaccination strategies in immunocompromised individuals.

Liquid (Liq) PCV-free HRV previously showed immunogenicity and safety profiles comparable to lyophilized (Lyo) HRV. Methods: This was a phase 3a, randomized, single-blind study (NCT03207750) conducted in the United States. Healthy infants aged 6-12 weeks received 2 doses (0, 2 months) of either Liq PCV-free HRV or Lyo HRV with routine vaccines (0, 2, 4 months): diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis, hepatitis B and inactivated poliovirus combination vaccine (DTaP-HBV-IPV), monovalent tetanus toxoid-conjugated vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib-TT), and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Coprimary objectives were: (i) to assess non-inferiority of immune responses to routine vaccine antigens 1 month post-dose 3 following co-administration with Liq PCV-free HRV compared to Lyo HRV; (ii) to rule out a 10% decrease in seroresponse to pertussis antigens after dose 3. Other objectives were to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of HRV vaccines. Results: Of 1272 vaccinated infants, 990 (489 in Liq PCV-free HRV and 501 in Lyo HRV group) were included in the per-protocol set. All statistical criteria were met, thus co-primary objectives were demonstrated. Seroprotection/seropositivity rates in both groups were high: 100% for diphtheria/tetanus, >= 99.3% for HBV, >= 99.8% for polio, >= 99.8% for each pertussis antigen, >= 90.8% for all pneumococcal serotypes except serotype 3 (>= 69.1%), and >= 97.4% for Hib. Most infants seroconverted for anti-RV antibodies (76.3% of Liq PCV-free HRV and 78.9% of Lyo HRV recipients). Geometric mean concentrations/titers were comparable between groups. Incidences of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar between groups. Conclusion: Routine pediatric vaccines co-administered with Liq PCV-free HRV showed non-inferior immune responses and similar safety profiles to those following co-administration with Lyo HRV.

J	Hodgkinson, B; Wang, TJ; Byrnes, J; Scuffham, P				Hodgkinson, Brent; Wang, Tianjiao; Byrnes, Joshua; Scuffham, Paul			Modelling a cost-effective vaccination strategy for the prevention of varicella and herpes zoster infection: A systematic review	VACCINE			English	Review						Varicella; Herpes zoster; Vaccination; Cost-effectiveness; Systematic review		Background: Varicella zoster virus (VZV) and its re-emergence as herpes zoster (HZ) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While studies show that VZV vaccination is effective in reducing VZV incidence, many decision makers have not added VZV to their vaccination schedule, largely due to uncertainty surrounding the effect of VZV vaccination on HZ incidence (exogenous boosting, EB), and the cost-effectiveness (CE) of vaccination. Methods: A systematic review was conducted to identify the current published evidence of CE of VZV vaccination strategies where both VZV and HZ incidence were modelled. Results: Six studies (one published in 2003 and five between 2010 and 2019), were identified with all conducting cost-utility analysis using a dynamic transmission modelling approach and assuming EB. All predicted that mass infant VZV vaccination would rapidly reduce VZV incidence, but HZ incidence would increase. Compared with no-vaccination, the CE of VZV vaccination strategies ranged from higher costs and poorer outcomes (dominated), towards CE (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of between $7,000 to $61,000 USD), or lower cost and better outcomes (dominant). However, without EB, HZ incidence immediately dropped below pre-vaccination levels making VZV vaccination quickly CE and/or dominant to a no vaccination strategy. Conclusions: Current models are sensitive to assumptions of EB suggesting that future studies consider an agent-based modelling approach to address the individual nature of variables that determine the infectiousness of VZV.

Vaccination has been shown to be an effective intervention to prevent rotavirus infections but has yet to be enlisted in the national immunisation programme. This study aimed to assess the cost-utility of introducing rotavirus vaccines, taking all WHO-prequalified vaccines into consideration. Methods: A cost-utility analysis was performed using a transmission dynamic model to estimate, from a societal perspective, the costs and outcomes of four WHO-prequalified rotavirus vaccines: Rotarix (R), RotaTeq (R), ROTAVAC (R) and ROTASIIL (R). The model was used to simulate the impact of introducing the vaccines among children aged < 1 year and compare this with no rotavirus vaccination. The vaccination programme was considered to be cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was less than a threshold of USD 5,110 per QALY gained. Results: Overall, without the vaccine, the model predicted the average annual incidence of rotavirus to be 312,118 cases. With rotavirus vaccination at a coverage of more than 95%, the average number of rotavirus cases averted was estimated to be 144,299 per year. All rotavirus vaccines were cost-saving. ROTASIIL (R) was the most cost-saving option, followed by ROTAVAC (R), Rotarix (R) and RotaTeq (R), providing average cost-savings of USD 32, 31, 23 and 22 million per year, respectively, with 999 QALYs gained. All vaccines remained cost-saving with lower QALYs gained, even when ignoring indirect beneficial effects. The net saving to the healthcare system when implementing any one of these vaccines would be between USD 13 and 33 million per year. Conclusion: Rotavirus vaccines should be included in the national vaccination programme in Thailand. Implementing any one of these four WHO-prequalified vaccines would reduce government healthcare spending while yielding health benefits to the population. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Emergency vaccination could be an alternative as vaccination is one of the most efficient and cost-effective measures to protect poultry from HPAI infection, preventing spreading to other poultry and greatly reducing the potential transmission to humans. Current conventional inactivated AI vaccines may be useful for combating AI outbreaks, but do not fulfil all targets of an ideal AI vaccine, including mass applicability and rapid onset of immunity. We aimed to further investigate the potential of Herpesvirus of Turkeys (HVT) as a vector containing a recombinant H5 hemagglutinin of HPAI H5N1. This HVT-H5 vector was analysed in vitro, tested for onset of immunity against AI challenge, breadth of protection, reduction of virus shedding, and induction of both antibody and cellular responses in SPF layers or broiler chicks containing maternal derived antibodies (MDA+). In SPF layers HVT-H5 provided full protection to lethal challenges with 4 antigenically diverse HPAI H5N1 strains from 2 weeks post vaccination (w.p.v.), while in MDA+ birds full protection was provided from 3 w.p.v. to homologous challenge. Also shedding of challenge virus was reduced in both SPF and MDA+ birds. HVT-H5 induced a protective HI titre (>= 4) to 11 HPAI H5N1 strains at 3 w.p.v. in 3-week-old SPF layers and to HPAI H5N8 A/ch/Net/14015531/2014. Besides inducing a protective antibody response HVT-H5 also induced an influenza-specific T cell response. This data demonstrates that HVT-H5 vaccine appears to fulfil many of the criteria for an ideal AI vaccine including early onset of immunity, a broad protection, reduced virus shedding, protection in presence of AI-MDA and could be a useful tool in the combat of AI outbreaks worldwide.

J	Kumar, N; Bhartiya, S; Singh, T				Kumar, Nishant; Bhartiya, Shibal; Singh, Tarundeep			Duration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies much shorter in India	VACCINE			English	Article								Seroprevalence survey, for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, of healthcare workers (HCW) working in three Government run hospitals in Mumbai was carried out in June 2020. Among the 801 HCWs tested, seroprevalence was 11.1%. Males (13.5% vs. 8.9% in females) and ancillary workers (18.5% vs 6.9% in doctors and nurses) were more likely to be seropositive. Sixty-two (7.74%) had been previously diagnosed with RT PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 44 (71%) were seronegative. Upto 28 days after a positive PCR test, 90% of subjects were found to be seropositive. This reduced to less than half (38.5%) between 29 and 42 days. None of 28 infected HCWs who had the RT-PCR more than 50 days ago tested positive for antibodies. It seems likely that cellular immunity plays a larger role in defence against the illness.

Adapting and piloting a vaccine hesitancy questionnaire in rural Guatemala	VACCINE			English	Article						Vaccine hesitancy; Immunization; Children; Vaccines; Guatemala	PARENT ATTITUDES	Introduction: We sought to (i) adapt a Spanish-language vaccine hesitancy (VH) tool to rural Guatemala, (ii) pilot the tool with 150 parents of children <= 5 years, and (iii) measure if parent scores associated with child under-vaccination. Methods: We used implementation science to develop the adapted Guatemalan Vaccine Attitudes (GuaVA) tool, piloting it with 150 parents of children <= 5 years, and performing descriptive and adjusted regression analyses. Results: Of 150 parents (response rate 99%), 55% (n = 83) of parents expressed a degree of VH. Children of parents with highly hesitant scores (n = 22) had 2.5 times the odds (OR 2.5; 95% CI: 1.2, 5.4) of being undervaccinated at 19 months, referent children of non-hesitant parents (n = 67). Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy may be more prevalent in rural Guatemala than suspected. Implementation science facilitated the adaptation of a VH tool to rural Guatemala and may assist investigators in other settings. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Williams, Joshua T.
