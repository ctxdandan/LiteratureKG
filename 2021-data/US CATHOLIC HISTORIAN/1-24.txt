J	Avella, SM				Avella, Steven M.			The Catholic Church in the Twentieth-Century American West: Spatial Realities, Demographic Growth, and Roman Observations	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						American West; Westward expansion; Vatican-U.S. relations; transnational Catholicism		The population of the American West-defined here as the states west of the Missouri River, including Alaska and Hawaii- grew dramatically during the twentieth century. Lured by product demand, tourism, improved transportation, and heavy federal government investment, Americans flocked to these states, especially California and Texas. This demographic surge led to an increase in the numbers of Catholics in the West and an explosion of new dioceses. As the West grew, the Vatican took notice. Correspondence between authorities in Rome and U.S. bishops reflect Western Catholicism's growth and transnational identity but also evidence the particular challenges of Catholic expansion. This essay maps the West's dramatic growth and Rome's response, bringing to Western historians' attention the significance of the region's Catholic presence and providing a lens for better understanding the American West's social and cultural experience.

J	Skaggs, M				Skaggs, Michael			No Revolution in Cincinnati: Jewish-Catholic Relations in the Era of Vatican II	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						Jewish-Catholic dialogue; Second Vatican Council; Nostra Aetate; First Amendment; civil rights; race relations; Project Commitment; Cincinnati; Ohio		In the common narrative of Catholic-Jewish relations in the twentieth century, the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on the Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions (Nostra Aetate) is considered the beginning of an era of mutual respect. But Nostra Aetate was not of equal importance everywhere. The example of Cincinnati, Ohio, demonstrates how Catholics and Jews had largely set their religious differences aside to focus on joint contributions to civic life. While Catholics and Jews differed sharply on the relationship between state and religion and the First Amendment's correct interpretation, they found common cause to work together in addressing centuries-old discrimination against African Americans. This case study of Jewish-Catholic relations shows that local histories, local problems, and local solutions can tell historians more about interfaith relations than global theological declarations.

J	Martinez, AM				Martinez, Anne M.			Catholic Monroeism: U.S. Support for the Catholic Church During the Mexican Revolution, 1914-1929	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						Mexican Revolution; Cristero Rebellion; Monroe Doctrine; U.S.-Mexico relations; anti-Catholicism		limits to European powers, and in 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt offered a corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, claiming a role for the U.S. in policing Latin America. The term Catholic Monroeism describes the application of the Monroe Doctrine and the Roosevelt Corollary to support the Catholic Church in Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. Facing anticlerical rhetoric and policies that restricted the Catholic Church's freedom in Mexico between 1914 and 1929, the U.S. government intervened on behalf of the Church. State Department records show the church-state conflict in Mexico was at the forefront of diplomatic discussions between the two countries. The U.S. government, in weighing intervention in Mexico, believed that the Church could promote harmony and order during a time of national upheaval and violence. Defending Catholicism in Mexico served as a vital component of American foreign policy and a matter of national self-interest for U.S. Catholics, whose previous attention to foreign relations focused on their European homelands.

J	Rademacher, N				Rademacher, Nicholas			Pursuing and Impeding: Civil Rights and the Redemptorist Mission in Orangeburg, South Carolina, 1930-1955	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						civil rights; race relations; Redemptorists; Orangeburg; South Carolina; Diocese of Charleston; South Carolina		The small Catholic community in Orangeburg, South Carolina, was racially divided when Redemptorist priests arrived from the North in 1930. Initially, their ministry seemed to support legalized segregation, though over time, through the leadership of the Black Catholic community, the Redemptorists increasingly and more publicly supported civil rights. Pro-segregationist White Catholics lashed out at the priests who were active in civil rights work and demanded that they be removed, but Redemptorist leadership and the Charleston bishop backed the activist priests. This conflict prompted ongoing reflection for the Redemptorists about how they had failed to properly form the consciences of their pro-segregationist parishioners and how they might heal divisions within the community.

J	Young, SL				Young, Samuel L.			An Agent of Anarchy and Tyranny: Martin Luther and American Democracy in Antebellum Catholic Apologetics	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						Luther; Martin; Reformation; apologetics; Protestant-Catholic relation		Beginning in the Early Republic's first decades, American Protestants construed their new nation as Protestant. This conception led to evaluations of Martin Luther as a proto-American figure, with his Reformation anticipating the American Revolution. In response, Catholics began adapting the traditional apologetic readings of Luther by Cocblaeus and Bossuet, increasingly emphasizing the disastrous political and social effects of his actions. The 1817 Reformation Jubilee elicited anti-Luther works from American Jesuits Roger Baxter, Anthony Kohlmann, and John William Beschter. This approach continued into the 1820s and 1830s as American Protestants further asserted their notion of a proto-American Luther. Catholics refined their arguments to conceptualize the reformer as a friend to tyrants, an enemy of religious liberty, and an instigator of anarchy. These efforts became the basis of the more prominently studied Catholic apologetics in the 1840s and 1850s, especially Bishop Martin John Spalding and Orestes Brownson.

J	Polistena, JC				Polistena, Joyce C.			Harlem Valley Churches: Social Action and Interreligious Collaboration in West Harlem	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						Harlem Valley Churches; Harlem; New York City; Castle; Robert; Calkins, Howard W.; interreligious collaboration; interfaith collaboration; urban renewal		Between 1987 and 1995, Black Catholics in West Harlem collaborated with Christian, Muslim, Jewish, and secular activists as part of the Harlem Valley Churches (HVC). Founded fry the energizing Catholic priest Howard W. Calkins and his close associate, Episcopal pastor Robert Castle, HVC formed alliances across religious and racial lines. The collaboration assisted Harlem residents in recognizing their differences along with highlighting unity and cooperation to further social change. While there are broad-based histories of African-American churches and urban renewal, partnerships such as HVC have not been adequately assessed fry historians. This study offers an insider's view of HVC and its role in working to transform West Harlem.

Because of its location on Lake Erie, the city became a haven for the Irish who built the Erie Canal and the Germans fleeing political turmoil in Europe. The Catholic Church responded to the growth, seeking to meet both the spiritual and secular needs of the growing immigrant and nativeborn Catholic population. The Diocese of Buffalo was established in 1847 with John Timon (1797-1867) as its first bishop. This American-born bishop fought religious, political, and cultural threats, resisting both Protestant and Catholic opposition, to solidify the Church's standing on the Niagara frontier. Through the formation of schools and institutions for health care and charity, he successfully established an assimilated American Catholic presence.

J	Kanter, DE				Kanter, Deborah E.			Mexican Priests and Migrant Ministry in the Midwest, 1953-1961	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						braceros; Operation Migratory Labor; Mexican-American Catholicism; Archbishop Robert Lucey; Archbishop Jose Garibi Rivera; Archdiocese of Guadalajara; migrant workers; Bishops' Committee on the Spanish-Speaking; Michigan; Ohio	LABOR	Mexico's Catholic hierarchy partnered with U.S. bishops in sending Mexican priests to minister to braceros (short-term Mexican contract workers) who relocated during summers to the Midwest, especially Ohio and Michigan, to work in agriculture. Based on recently-uncovered letters, this essay concentrates on the experience of these bracero-misioneros. In ministering to Spanish-speaking migrants from both Mexico and the U.S., the priests usually approved of those from Mexico while questioning the religiosity of U.S.-based Mexican migrants. The priests' seasonal visits over nine summers (1953-1961) strengthened migrant ministry and Spanish-speaking apostolates as diocesan clergy and laypeople grew familiar with the migrants' needs.

J	Mannard, JG				Mannard, Joseph G.			"Wilhelmina Jones, Come Out!": Public Reaction to the Reception of Sister M. Stanislaus Jones into Georgetown Visitation Monastery, 1825-1826	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						anti-Catholicism; women religious; nuns; conversion; Georgetown Visitation Monastery; Visitation nuns; Visitandines; Washington; D.C.; Joncs, Wilhclmina; Jones, Jacob	AMERICAN; WOMAN	Wilhelmina Jones was the beautiful and accomplished daughter of Commodore Jacob Jones, a decorated hero of the Barbary Wars and the War of 1812. At the age of twenty-three, after converting to Roman Catholicism, Wilhelmina Jones entered Georgetown Visitation Monastery on March 18, 1825, never to return to the secular world. Public reaction to Wilhelmina's decision, as measured in the response of her father and brother, crowd protests outside Georgetown Convent, and coverage in the secular press demonstrate that many, perhaps most, Americans found her choice to renounce the world to be puzzling at best and suspicious at worst. Close examination of the reaction to the Wilhelmina Jones case provides a lens revealing the ambiguous status of Catholicism, especially its conventual institutions, a decade before the heavy influx of Irish and German immigration trimered the revival of more overt anti-Catholic nativism.

J	DeStefano, M				DeStefano, Michael			"We shall be a Catholic country": Counting Catholics in the Antebellum United States	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						statistics; demographics; Carroll; Bishop John; Beecher; Lyman; England; Bishop John; Hughes; Bishop John		The size of the United States Catholic population interested Catholics and Protestants in the nineteenth century. Administrative reports, missionary chronicles, directories, travelers' accounts, and newspaper and magazine articles chronicled Catholic growth and its various causes: natural increase, immigration, conversion, and acquisition by the United States of territories with a Catholic presence. Growth estimates, whether local numbers or national totals, varied enormously throughout the century. Despite this variety, the narrative behind the numbers told a remarkably consistent story: for better or worse, Catholics were increasing.

Scores of Catholic priests and hundreds of vowed religious women took up this challenge as chaplains and nurses during the war, diminishing anti-Catholicism and winning converts. Historians in recent years have examined various aspects of this ministry, highlighting the individual and collective contributions of Catholic chaplains and nurses. 'This article extends this research by analyzing the impact of Catholic war ministry on non-Catholics in the United States.

J	Wright, RE				Wright, Robert E.			Religious Change Along the Mexican Border, 1852-1876	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						Mexican Catholicism; border religion; Rio Grande country; South Texas; Northeastern Mexico; Oblates of Mary Immaculate		After the U.S. conquest and annexation of territory north of the Rio Grande River, French clergy who arrived in deep South Texas during the 1850s encountered a large Mexican Catholic population. Due to the critical shortage of clergy in Northeastern Mexico, these priests were drawn into transnational ministry south of the Rio Grande. For decades these clergy prioritized ministry to Mexicans, even in the face of church leaders who faulted them for not privileging Anglo Americans. Political changes in Mexico overturned the Catholic Church's status in that nation and had a significant religious impact in the Rio Grande country during the 1870s. Mexicans on both sides of the border were affected by Liberal policies and the challenge of the first Mexican Protestant congregations.

J	Grimes, RR				Grimes, Robert R.			Harmonious Discord: Nineteenth-Century Music and New York City's Church of St. Francis Xavier	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						music; church music; Catholic music; New York City; Manhattan; Church of St. Francis Xavier; Berge; William		In 1847, the Jesuits succeeded on their third attempt to establish themselves in New York City. After a difficult beginning, in 1851 they opened the parish church of St. Francis Xavier on West 16th Street in Manhattan, and it soon became one of the most well-known parishes in the nation's fast-growing city. Although the church building was not large in size, under the direction of William Berge as organist and conductor, its music became famous throughout the city and beyond, as much with Protestants as with Catholics. The repertory was influenced by changing musical tastes and ecclesiastical legislation over the years and that of other Catholic churches in the city. The Manhattan parishes of St. Stephen's and St. Paul the Apostle sometimes vied with Xavier for the finest or the most "Catholic" music. Xavier was so successful that by the 1880s a much larger church was needed. The move from the old structure to the new one marked a significant moment of change in the parish and its music, the neighborhood and the city, and the Catholic Church itself.

J	Osborne, CR				Osborne, Catherine R.			The Art of the "Global Church": Around the World with Liturgical Arts	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						liturgical movement; Liturgical Arts; Liturgical Arts Society; Lavanoux; Maurice; inculturation; globalism	CHINA	The U.S. journal Liturgical Arts offered readers a glimpse into the art and architecture of the "global church" during the 1950s, when the journal's editor Maurice Lavanoux traveled widely in Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. Lavanoux's long relationships with missionaries significantly shaped the journal's presentation of how to inculturate art and architecture. Conflicting values, however, led the journal to inconsistent judgments. At times it leaned towards an adaptationist approach; at others, it moved towards interpreting inculturation as modernizing. When it came to art, however, Lavanoux wholly favored including art with non-white biblical figures in both mission and Western churches. This essay argues that Liturgical Arts is a valuable source for insight into Euro-American views on inculturation immediately prior to Vatican II and the advance of liberation theology.

J	Schmidt, KL				Schmidt, Kelly L.			"Without slaves and without assassins": Antebellum Cincinnati, Transnational Jesuits, and the Challenges of Race and Slavery	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						slavery; race; abolition; anti-Catholicism; nativism; Society of Jesus; Jesuits; Jesuit colleges; St. Xavier College; Cincinnati; Ohio		Though established in Ohio, a free state, the Archdiocese of Cincinnati was immersed in slavery through its origins, clergy, religious orders, schools, and lay Catholics. This article explores the archdiocese's ties to slavery through its relationship with the Jesuits who assumed leadership of the diocesan institution of higher education, the Athenaeum, and renamed it St. Xavier College. It examines how the college's administrators sustained the school through direct and financial ties to slavery. Operating in a city beset by controversy-where nativism, debates over slavery and sectionalism, and anti-Catholicism intersected, Jesuits from Europe and the U.S., shaped by international, national, and local influences, responded to the region's growing racial and sectional tensions. Both individually and collectively, they harbored competing allegiances and opinions that were largely withheld from public discourse to prevent discord. St. Xavier College's Jesuits made choices cautiously and strategically to navigate regional and global contexts of their educational ministry.

J	Connolly, MBF				Connolly, Mary Beth Fraser			From Welfare to Worship: The Sisters of Charity, the Santa Maria Institute, and the Founding of Cincinnati's Italian Parishes	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						Italian-Americans; Cincinnati; Ohio; Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati; Santa Maria Institute; Segale; Sister Blandina; Segale; Sister Justina; Italian parishes; national parishes; assimilation; Americanization		While Irish and Germans dominated Cincinnati's foreign-born population, an Italian minority formed during the latter nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1890 the city's first Italian national parish, Sacro Cuore di Gesu was established, but not all Italians joined. Fearing the loss of Italian immigrants to Protestant evangelizers, Cincinnati Archbishop William Henry Elder asked the Sisters of Charity to establish a mission for serving Italians' spiritual and material needs. In response, two Italian-born Sisters of Charity, Sisters Blandina and Justina Segale, organized the Santa Maria Institute, a Catholic settlement house and social service center. As an extension of Santa Maria Institute, two new welfare centers (which became parishes) were formed in the 1920s: Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Walnut Hills and San Antonio di Padova in Fairmount. Through Santa Maria Institute and the city's three Italian parishes, the growing community of Italian immigrants was evangelized and received material aid, forging a close relationship between the Catholic faith and the Italians' new country.

J	Hess, MP				Hess, Matthew P.			Public and Parochial: How the Sisters of the Precious Blood Shaped State-Funded Education in Ohio	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						Sisters of the Precious Blood; Catholic education; public education; secularism; Fort Recovery; Ohio		The Sisters of the Precious Blood came to West Central and Northwestern Ohio to minister to immigrant Catholics who began arriving by the 1830s. Many communities were predominately German Catholic, and religious sisters were considered best equipped to teach. As villages formed their own schools, many were attached to Catholic parishes, including some that benefited from common school funds. Consequently, many Sisters of the Precious Blood served as teachers in publicly-funded educational institutions. When schools expanded and merged in the early twentieth century, some Precious Blood Sisters found themselves in more diverse communities, with an increasing number of non-Catholics in the classroom. Some questioned the employment of sisters in state-supported schools, and court cases ensued. A test case against the school board in Fort Recovery required the Precious Blood Sisters' testimony. Although the court decided against the school board and required modification of the sisters' presence, they continued teaching in Ohio's public schools until the mid-1990s.

J	Dulle, T				Dulle, Tim Jr Jr			The Witness of the Central American Martyrs: A Social Justice Aesthetic at U.S. Jesuit Colleges and Universities	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						Society of Jesus; Jesuits; Catholic higher education; social justice; visual culture; El Salvador; Ellacuria; Ignacio; S.J.; Universidad Centroamericana; Rockhurst University; Xavier University; Ignatian Solidarity Network		In 1989 the Salvadoran military murdered six Jesuit priests and two of their companions at the Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), the Jesuit university in San Salvador. The killings ignited international protests, and the victims, well-known for their advocacy of human rights and social justice, quickly became celebrated martyrs. The Jesuits of the United States, who maintained a strong relationship with their Central American counterparts, were especially active in mobilizing their network in remembrance of the UCA martyrs. In the decades since their deaths, these figures have become important symbols representing a social justice vision for Jesuit higher education in the U.S. The network's members often made use of aesthetic commemorations to invite others into the martyrs' ongoing legacy, thereby staking a position in the ongoing contest concerning the soul of U.S. Catholic higher education.

J	Harmon, KE				Harmon, Katharine E.			"Guitar-totin' Nuns and Hand-clappin' Love Songs": How the Implementation of the Vernacular Transformed American Catholic Church Music	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						Liturgical reform; vernacular; folk music; hymnody; Catholic liturgy; Mass		Between 1964 and 1969, permission to use the vernacular in worship fundamentally transformed U.S. Catholic church music. Following the vernacular's implementation in November 1964, Catholic music's inseparable connection to Latin chant disappeared, enabling completely new genres of music and instruments to be played during Mass and inspiring significant creativity and experimentation among young Catholic composers. But, the faithful polarized over how music should be affected by the Second Vatican Council's call to aggiornamento, divided as to whether church music should reflect a progressive post-conciliar Catholicism or function to preserve tradition. Ultimately, existing preferences among most American Catholic faithful for the use of the vernacular and hymns, relatively little experience by congregations with the sung High Mass or Latin, and American publishers' choices to promote vernacular and popular music resulted in the widespread adoption of folk-inspired hymnody-nothing less than a seismic shift in the repertoire of American Catholic church music.

J	Howard, AR				Howard, Agnes R.			A Higher Middle Way: Birth Philosophy at the Catholic Maternity Institute, 1944-1969	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						childbirth; maternity; prenatal care; midwifery; motherhood; family life; Santa Fe; New Mexico; Catholic Maternity Institute; Medical Mission Sisters	MIDWIFERY	Drawing upon Catholic views of childbearing and the role of laywomen, the Medical Mission Sisters at the Catholic Maternity Institute (CMI) in Santa Fe, New Mexico, reconciled competing cultural and medical approaches to birth. Operating between 1944 and 1969, the CMI is noteworthy for starting the first free-standing birth center in the United States, for reducing maternal and infant mortality, and for its birth philosophy. Operating at the borders dividing cultures-medical and spiritual, technological and natural, Latino and Anglo-American-the CMI developed a distinctive vision of maternity care. The sisters kept childbirth centered around women at a time when birth was moving decisively into the purview of doctors and hospitals. The sisters' mediating approach helped resolve the central conundrum of prenatal care: why women should change prenatal behaviors, departing from social expectations and traditions, when their actions could not assure fetal health. The CMI resolved this tension by emphasizing birth as women's active participation in God's creative work.

J	Perrone, F				Perrone, Fernanda			Cloistered Visionary: Sister Mary of the Compassion and the Art Apostolate in Union City, New Jersey	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						religious art; liturgical art; liturgical movement; contemplative nuns; Dominican artists; Rowe; Constance Mary; Union City; New Jersey; Dominican Sisters of the Perpetual Rosary; Blue Chapel		The contemplative Dominican nun, Sister Mary of the Compassion (Constance Mary Rowe) (1908-1977), became a successful artist from within the cloister. Born in Great Britain, she came to New York to advance her art career but discerned a vocation to the Dominican Sisters of the Perpetual Rosary in Union City, New Jersey. While best known to those living near her monastery, her influence spread worldwide through exhibits and publications. Impacted by the liturgical movement and medieval and early renaissance art, Sister Mary of the Compassion's work can be seen in the context of the development of Christian art, Catholic Action, the liturgical revival, and the history of women religious.

J	Dugan, K				Dugan, Katherine			Humanae Vitae, Natural Family Planning, and U.S. Catholic Identity: The Founding of the Couple to Couple League	US CATHOLIC HISTORIAN			English	Article						Natural Family Planning; Humanae Vitae; Couple to Couple League; Cincinnati; Ohio; Kippley; John; Kippley; Sheila; Bernardin; Archbishop Joseph		Y The origins of the Couple to Couple League (CCL) in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati date to 1972 when John and Sheila Kippley moved to Ohio and brought with them the newly-founded CCL, an organization committed to teaching and promoting Natural Family Planning. Drawing on archival research and ethnographic interviews with the Kippleys, this article posits that CCL's history is part of a twentieth-century intra-Catholic debate over what ought to define Catholic identity in the United States. The Kippleys founded CCL as a part of their commitment to being pro-Humanae Vitae Catholics. They largely defined their Catholicism by adherence to this papal teaching. This article argues that CCL's origins in Cincinnati illuminate how definitions of Catholic identity were reworked in the 1970s through Humanae Vitae's interpretations and relationships between the laity and hierarchy.

Gilligan, a member of the Holy See's diplomatic corps from Cincinnati, Ohio, was appointed secretary to China's first Papal Internuncio, Archbishop Antonio Riberi, when bilateral diplomatic relations were established between Rome and the Chinese Nationalist (Guomindang) government. Gilligan's correspondence from 1946 to 1953 records the government's successive defeats in the Chinese civil war, communism's growing strength, and the suffering of native Chinese and missionary clergy and religious. The Internuncio sent Gilligan to accompany the retreating Nationalist government and assist exiled clergy and religious entering Hong Kong. By 1952, the need to assist refugees declined, prompting a discernment that ultimately led Gilligan to resign from the Holy See's diplomatic service and return to the Archdiocese of Cincinnati.
