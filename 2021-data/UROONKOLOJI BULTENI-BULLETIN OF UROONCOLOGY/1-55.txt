Computed tomography revealed a horseshoe kidney, grade 2 hydronephrosis and a focal hyperdense lesion, of which differential diagnosis between mass and abscess could not be made, in the right kidney. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed subsequently and revealed a mass. Right radical nephroureterectomy was then performed. Pathological examination described a fragile, necrotic lesion, which was a sign of chronic pyelonephritis that dilated the pelvicalyceal system. It was also associated with the mucosa and formed cystic structures with a size of 5x4 cm in the cortex. Chronic pyelonephritis cases with acute episodes should be considered in the differential diagnosis of renal tumours.

This study aimed to compare the demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment responses, and survival characteristics of patients with seminomatous GCTs (SGCT) and non-seminomatous GCTs (NSGCTs) followed in our center. Materials and Methods: Patients with histologically confirmed testicular Gas and followed up in our hospital between January 2005 and January 2021 were included in this retrospective study. This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Ankara City Hospital. Results: Of the 360 patients, 65.8% (n=123) had NSGCTs and 34.2% (n=237) had SGCTs. The median age at diagnosis of the SGCT group was 36 years and that of the NSGCT group was 28 years (p=0.000). Both the diagnostic and postoperative levels of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin were significantly higher in the NSGCT group (p=0.000, p=0.000 respectively). Rates of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (3.3% vs 9.3%; p-0.036), adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) (17.1% vs 3%; p=0.000), adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) (61.1% vs 40.4%; p=0.003), and metastatic first-line a (22.8% vs 47.3%; p=0.000) were different between the two groups. The 10-year overall survival expectancy rate was 89% in the SGCT group and 83% in the NSGCT group. Conclusion: This study drew attention to the characteristics and treatment responses of patients with NSGCTs and SGCTs. In this study, NSGCTs were diagnosed at an earlier age than SGCTs. The proportion of patients with stage 1 disease at diagnosis was higher in the SGCT group, while that of patients with stage 3 and metastasis at diagnosis were higher in the NSGCT group. In addition, the rates of adjuvant a and adjuvant RT were higher in the SGCT group, while the metastatic first-line a rate was higher in the NSGCT group.

Thus, it is essential to distinguish this carcinoma from gastrointestinal metastases, as different therapeutic strategies are often necessary. We report the case of a 23 year old female patient with primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the bladder that invades the pelvic wall and treated with partial cystectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. No metastatic spread or recurrence was detected in the patient after 12 months of follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first youngest female patient reported in the English literature.

We evaluated the clinicopathological characteristics of 26 patients in three different clinics and aimed to determine the prognostic factors affecting oncological outcomes. Materials and Methods: Between January 2012 and October 2019, we retrospectively analyzed the data of twenty-six patients aged between 44-75 years who were diagnosed and treated due to non-urothelial bladder carcinomas in three clinics. Results: Among twenty-six cases, nineteen (73.1%) were male and seven (26.9%) were female. The mean age at diagnosis was 60.77 +/- 8.52. The most common presenting complaint was gross hematuria (84.6%). It was followed by lower urinary tract symptoms (38.4%). Histological types of tumors were squamous cell carcinoma (9 cases, 34.8%), adenocarcinoma (eight cases carrying different histopathologic subtypes: Mucinous, signet ring cell, plasmacytoid/signet ring cell mixed variant and signet ring cell containing osteoclast-like giant cell, 30.8%), small cell carcinoma (3 cases, 11.5%), large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (2 cases, 7.7%), extra-gastrointestinal stromal tumor (1 case, 3.8%) and malignant undifferentiated mesenchymal tumor (1 case, 3.8%) and leiomyosarcoma (2 cases, 7.6%). At a median follow-up of 13 (2-42) months, the progression-free survival rate was 61.5%, while the overall survival rate was 46.1%. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the median survival of all cases was found to be 16 (9-33) months. Overall survival times were lower in the presence of advanced (3-4) pathological stages (p=0.006) and higher (>= 2) ECOG scores (p=0.005). Conclusion: In our cases, we observed that overall survival rates increased in patients undergoing multimodal treatments involving radical cystectomy compared to the bladder-sparing approach. The survival rates were higher in squamous cell carcinomas, while the rate of metastasis was higher in adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors. Up-staging rates after cystectomy were higher in adenocarcinomas, sarcomas and squamous cell carcinomas.

However, due to method insufficiency and recent developments in prostate imaging, new biopsy methods were introduced. This study aimed to evaluate prostate cancer detection rates by the standard and magnetic resonance (MR) fusion biopsy methods. The main purpose of our study is to mutually evaluate prostate cancer detection rates and results of standard and cognitive MR fusion biopsy methods and share our experiences in this process. Materials and Methods: Patients, who underwent prostate biopsy due to elevated serum prostate-specific antigen levels (>4ng/mL) and/or suspicious rectal examination, were retrospectively evaluated. A total of 160 patients were included in the study between January 2018 and January 2021. Patients were divided into two groups according to the applied method, as standard biopsy (SB) and MR fusion biopsy. Results: Prostate cancer was reported in 25 (31.3%) of 80 patients who underwent SB, wherein 20 (25%) were determined with clinically significant cancer. Prostate cancer was reported in 30 (37.5%) of 80 patients who underwent MR fusion biopsy, wherein 25 (31%) were reported as clinically significant cancer. A statistically significant difference was found in detecting prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer when the prostate imaging-Reporting and Data System (3,4,5) scores were compared with each other (p<0.05, p=0.00). The additional SB to MR-targeted fusion biopsy was statistically significant in prostate cancer diagnosis (p=0.01, p<0.05). Conclusion: The additional SB to targeted biopsy increased the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer. Larger randomized studies are needed to reach a consensus on the ideal biopsy technique.

Fazilet Oner			Effect of Diabetes Mellitus and Metformin Usage on Treatment Outcomes and Side Effects on Prostate Cancer Treated with Radical Radiotherapy	UROONKOLOJI BULTENI-BULLETIN OF UROONCOLOGY			English	Article						Prostate cancer; diabetes mellitus; metformin; radiotherapy; side effects	THERAPY; HYPERGLYCEMIA; ASSOCIATION; MANAGEMENT; RECURRENCE; MORTALITY	Objective: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common comorbidity in patients with prostate cancer. Radiotherapy was reported to induce acute and late side effects in patients with DM due to vascular damage. Moreover, some studies have shown that metformin, an oral antidiabetic drug, can reduce biochemical and disease recurrence in patients with prostate cancer. This study aimed to evaluate retrospectively the effect of metformin on biochemical disease control and to observe the acute and late side effects of prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy. Materials and Methods: This study enrolled 94 patients who received radical radiotherapy between 2010 and 2017. However, out of 22 patients with DM, 17 received metformin and five received metformin plus insulin treatment. Biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS), overall survival, and side effects were assessed between patients with and without DM. Results: The median follow-up time was 57 (15-128) months. The 5-year bRFS rate in patients with and without DM were 100% and 89.2%, respectively (p=0.10). Acute grade 1-2 side effects were observed in all patients with DM, while 56 (78%) patients without DM had acute side effects, and the difference is significant (p=0.02). Acute grade 3 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity was found in one patient without DM, whereas late grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in one patient with DM. Conclusion: Although patients with DM were found to have better bRFS than patients without DM, we could not show the benefit of metformin, and the difference was not significant. By contrast, acute side effects were significantly higher in patients with DM.	[Dagdelen, Meltem; Barlas, Ceren; Yildirim, Cumhur; Karacam, Songul Cavdar; Dincbas, H.

Materials and Methods: Radiological and pathological data of patients who underwent radical nephrectomy for renal tumour diagnosed with uRCC according to histopathologic evaluation were investigated between 2006 and 2013. Follow-up data, such as metastasis-free and overall survivals, were also evaluated. Patients' characteristics and data were compared between localised tumour (T1-T2) and locally invasive tumour (T3-T4) groups and metastasis positive and negative groups during follow-up, separately. Results: A total of 17 patients participated in the study, wherein 7 had adrenalectomy in addition to radical nephrectomy and 3 had lymph node dissection. The mean tumour diameter was 91.9 +/- 44 mm (30-200 mm), and seven patients were pathologically T3a, two were T3b and one patient had T4 tumour, whereas eight had Fuhrman grade 4 and five had Fuhrman grade 3 tumours. Pathologically, seven patients had tumours with sarcomatoid features, whereas four had microvascular invasion and seven had renal sinus invasion. T-stage correlated with renal sinus invasion and was identified as an important factor in metastasis progression. The overall survival time was observed to be low in locally invasive and metastasis positive groups. Nevertheless, differences were not statistically significant. In the investigation of factors affecting metastasis development, microvascular invasion and renal sinus invasion were significant. Conclusion: The study revealed more aggressive nature (advanced stage, bigger tumour, more aggressive histopathological features and more metastasis and shorter survival on follow-up) of uRCC tumours, even without obtaining statistically significant differences.

Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for organ-limited prostate cancer were retrospectively examined. Twenty-five patients without recurrence after definitive treatment and 25 patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence at postoperative follow-up were classified as group 1 and group 2. Positive prostate biopsy cores of patients were stained with AMACR/P504S, prospectively. Staining intensities were scored as negative (score=0), weak (score=1), moderate (score=2) and strong (score=3). Groups were compared regarding AMACR/P504S staining intensities of biopsy cores. Results: The mean AMACR/P504S staining scores of positive biopsy cores were 1.88 +/- 0.85 and 1.27 +/- 1.22 for group 1 and group 2. There was a statistically significant relationship between mean AMACR/P504S staining scores and PSA recurrence (p=0.002). AMACR score groups were not separated concerning biochemical recurrence endpoints in the Kaplan-Meier analysis (p=0.43). Conclusion: There is a significant relationship between increased AMACR/P504S expression in cancerous prostate tissue and PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy.

Various factors cause granulomatous inflammation in the testicles, and it may accompany malignancies. Radiologically, granulomatous orchitis can be confused with malignancy. This paper presents the differential diagnoses of granulomatous orchitis. A 52-year-old man with testicular swelling was referred to the urology clinic. A palpable mass was detected by physical examination. Ultrasonography revealed a solid, heterogeneous 2.5 cm mass suspected as a malignancy in the right testes. The patient underwent elective orchiectomy. Microscopically, the testicle showed necrotising granulomatous inflammation accompanied by an inflammatory infiltrate that destroyed the testicular structure and caused rete testis hyperplasia. Radiologically, granulomatous orchitis can be confused with malignancy. Sufficient samples should be taken to exclude malignancy. Idiopathic granulomatous orchitis can be diagnosed after excluding all possible causes of granulomatous orchitis.

A Multicentre Study of Urooncology Association, Turkey	UROONKOLOJI BULTENI-BULLETIN OF UROONCOLOGY			English	Article						Prostate cancer; radical prostatectomy; clinically insignificant prostate cancer; Epstein criteria; 12-core prostate biopsy scheme	PERINEURAL INVASION; ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE; NEEDLE-BIOPSY; ADENOCARCINOMA; STAGE; CANDIDATES; OUTCOMES; UPDATE; EXTENT; MEN	Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the relevance of the Epstein criteria for the 12-core transrectal prostate biopsy (TRUS-Bx) scheme with the evaluation of clinicopathologic data recorded in the Urologic Cancer Database - Prostate (UroCaD-P), Urooncology Association, Turkey (UOAT). Materials and Methods: Patients with detailed pathological 12-core TRUS-Bx data for each biopsy core and who underwent RP due to PCa were included in this study. A total of 1167 patients from seven different centres were analysed. TRUS-Bx pathological findings were separately evaluated in the areas matching the sextant biopsy (6-core paramedian-lateral) scheme and in all 12-core biopsy areas (12-core biopsy scheme). Overall detection rates of PCa and ratios of clinically significant (sPCa) and insignificant PCa (insPCa) after RP were defined and compared between the biopsy schemes. Biopsy findings, according to the Epstein criteria, were also compared between the two schemes. A model for each biopsy scheme was created, including the Epstein criteria and additional biopsy findings using logistic regression analysis to predict clinically sPCa after RP. Results: There was a high correlation for the prediction of clinically insPCa between the two biopsy schemes in the same population. However, 7.3% of PCa could not be diagnosed in the 6-core TRUS-Bx scheme. Also, 69.4% of these had clinically sPCa according to the Epstein criteria in 12-core TRUS-Bx scheme and 51.8% of these were clinically sPCa after RP. The presence of perineural invasion (PNI) in 12-core biopsy was also significant regarding predicting sPCa (p<0.001). Conclusion: The Epstein criteria in 12-core prostate biopsy provide a better prediction of clinically sPCa than the 6-core biopsy scheme. Biopsy PNI findings appeared to improve the effectiveness of 12-core prostate biopsy, in addition to the Epstein criteria.

J	Ok, F				Ok, Fesih			Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin Treatment During The Coronavirus Disease-2019 Pandemic: A Review of Current Recommendations	UROONKOLOJI BULTENI-BULLETIN OF UROONCOLOGY			English	Review						Bladder cancer; intravesical BCG; COVID-19; coronavirus; pandemic	BLADDER-CANCER; RISK	Objective: Many outpatient procedures were restricted to reduce the likelihood of transmission during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The most effective treatment of high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is the intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy, consisting of induction and maintenance, which requires repeated hospital visits. Therefore, treatment protocol adaptation to the pandemic is important. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature review was performed between January 2020 and December 2020 within the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Results: Recommendations and updates of two international associations, two national associations, and five intravesical BCG application studies were discussed. During the pandemic, intravesical BCG treatment was delayed for patients with NMIBC in the intermediate-risk group. The general view for patients in the high-risk group is to complete induction therapy, if possible. Recommendations for maintenance treatment vary. With this treatment, planning should be done in less than one year. The existence of suspected or approved COVID-19 disease delayed the BCG treatment for 3 weeks. Conclusion: Consensus was not found on how intravesical BCG treatment should be applied during the pandemic. However, it is recommended to at least complete induction therapy in high-risk NMIBC as the risk of progression and recurrence is high. BCG instillations can be delayed for at least 3 weeks in patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease.

Materials and Methods: Ninety patients underwent TRUS-Bx. Group 1 included patients who underwent biopsy with an 18G needle (n=45), and group 2 included patients who underwent biopsy with a 16G needle (n=45). Sexual function in both groups was prospectively compared. Additionally, the patients' age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, cancer detection rate, complication rates, visual analog scale (VAS), and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) scores were compared. Results: Age, PSA, prostate volume, cancer detection rate, complication rates and VAS were not found statistically different between the groups. No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of the five main items of IIEF before the procedure. The intercourse satisfaction value was found to be significantly lower after the procedure than before the procedure in group 1 (p<0.05). Orgasmic function, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction were statistically significantly lower after the procedure than before the procedure in group 2 (p<0.001). Orgasmic function and overall satisfaction were lower in group 2 and significantly different between the two groups four weeks after the procedure (p<0.001). Conclusion: Although erectile function, sexual desire, and intercourse satisfaction were not different on using different needle sizes, in patients where 16G needles were used, orgasmic function and overall satisfaction were lower four weeks after the procedure.

Materials and Methods: Pathology reports of 1129 RCC cases were checked retrospectively, and 70 RCC cases with SPMTs were included in the study. One patient had two and the other had three different SPMTs, so the total number of SPMTs was 73. According to occurrence times of SPMTs, the cases were classified as the antecedent, synchronous, subsequent and unknown. The first three groups were compared according to their clinicopathological features. Results: The incidence of SPMTs with RCC in our study was 6.2% and lower than that reported by many other studies. The most common SPMTs were gastrointestinal, breast, prostate, lung, thyroid carcinomas and haematolymphoid malignancies. Sixty-two per cent of SPMTs were developed as synchronous and subsequent. There was no statistically significant difference among groups regarding age, histological subtype and RCC size. Male patients had a higher percentage in the synchronous group. In all groups, the most common RCC subtype was clear cell carcinoma. The RCC subtype in cases with multiple SPMTs was papillary. The prostatic adenocarcinoma rate was remarkable in males with papillary type RCC. Conclusion: RCC can coexist with secondary malignancies. Therefore, when a new tumour appears in a patient with RCC in clinical follow-up, it is appropriate to evaluate that tumour histopathologically or cytopathologically regarding SPMT before accepting it as a metastatic spread.

This study investigates the association of 5-OHU incision activity with the risk of disease progression in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) regarding grade and stage. Materials and Methods: During transurethral resection of 17 NMIBC patients, the papillary tumour before monopolar resection and healthy bladder mucosal tissue from the same person were obtained using cold cup biopsy. Both the normal mucosa and NMIBC tumour were pathologically confirmed. The histological grade and stage were also determined. The 5-OHU incision activity of all tissues was measured using a radiolabelled 5-OHU modified base containing DNA substrate. Results: 5-OHU incision activity was significantly higher in all high-grade NMIBC tissue extracts compared with the corresponding normal tissues (p=0.001). However, we found no significant difference in 5-OHU incision activity in low-grade NMIBC tissues (p=0.89). There was also a significant increase in 5-OHU incision activity at the Ta/T1 stage compared with the corresponding normal tissue (p=0.001). Conclusion: The increase in 5-OHU incision activity according to the histological grade of NMIBC tissue indicates that this activity (mainly performed by NTHL1 and NEIL1 DNA glycosylases) might play a role in NMIBC prognosis. Thus, it could be used as a potential prognostic biomarker for NMIBC.

Materials and Methods: All patients with locally advanced disease or peritoneal metastases requiring concurrent urological procedures in our clinic between January 2014 and December 2020 were evaluated for this study. Only patients with bladder and ureter intervention were included in the study. Postoperative complications and urological complications were evaluated and classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Imaging studies, interventional procedures, and follow-ups of patients with problems related to the urinary system in the long-term were recorded. The survival times of the patients were investigated. Results: A total of 52 patients underwent simultaneous urological resection (ureter and bladder). As a synchronous urological procedure, an end-to-end anastomosis was performed after ureter resection in 12 patients, transureter anastomosis to 4, partial cystectomy in 20, ileal conduit with total cystectomy in 7, orthotropic neobladder in 1, and ureteroneocystostomy in 8. The most common early complication in all patients was urinary leakage (10 patients), followed by wound infection (6 patients). The shortest and longest follow-up period of the whole group was 8 and 78 months, respectively, and the mean survival time was 38 months. No difference was found between patients with malignant ureter and benign ureter resections in terms of survival (p=0.888). Conclusion: In patients with clinical T4b and colorectal malignancies, en bloc resection should be the oncological procedure for bladder resections; if possible, organ-preserving surgery should be performed with sufficient negative margin. However, it is thought that the late outcomes of ureteroneocystostomy in ureter reconstruction are better and those of total cystectomy procedure are worse.

The most important clinical prediction for deciding on curative treatment in localized prostate cancer treatment is the 10-year survival status of the patient. In advanced prostate cancers, treatment is usually decided according to the comorbidity and age of the patients. Guidelines and consensus reports recommend that patients' general health status should be determined by validated health status screening forms in deciding on treatment for prostate cancer in elderly patients. After evaluating the health status, the treatment options recommended by the guidelines should be presented to the patients according to the risk group of the patient and the treatability of the existing diseases, regardless of their age. Patients who are found to be healthy as a result of the evaluation should be included in the standard treatment applied to non-elderly patients. For patients who are frail but have treatable disease, standard treatment is recommended after correction or improvement of comorbidities. Supportive treatment and adapted treatment options should be offered to the patients who are in a frail state.

Materials and Methods: This single-center retrospective study analyzed data of 443 patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy (RP) with localized prostate cancer. Surgical and clinicopathologic data, oncological and functional outcomes, and complications were compared between RRP and RARP groups. The comparison was made by the Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, and t-test for qualitative and quantitative variables, as appropriate. Log rank test was used to determine the biochemical recurrence-free survival of both surgical methods. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate survival rates. Results: The RRP and RARP groups included 231 and 212 patients, respectively. Blood loss, indwelling catheter duration, and hospitalization rates were low in the RARP group. Although the continence rates were better in the RARP group at 3 months, they were comparable at 12 months. In both groups, erection sufficient for sexual intercourse was comparable at 3 and 12 months. The mean lymph node yield was higher in the RRP group than in the RARP group. On median 28-month follow-up, no difference was found in the oncological results. Conclusion: Although the oncological and functional results of RRP and RARP are comparable, RARP is a more minimally invasive procedure. In our opinion, the surgeon's experience is more effective than the chosen technique.

Materials and Methods: Data of 89 patients who underwent radical cystectomy were examined. Our study included only cases with stage 2 urothelial bladder cancer. They were classified according to the lymph node status based on the surgical specimen. Patients with negative results were classified as group 1 and those with positive results as group 2. Patients in group 2 were further evaluated in two subgroups according to their lymph node density. Accordingly, group 2A consisted of patients with lymph node density of <20%, and group 2B involved those with lymph node density of >= 20%. Groups were compared statistically according to NLR. Results: Of the patients, 71 (79.8%) were male. The patients' mean ages and neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were 67.36 +/- 8.64 years, 6.89 +/- 3.02 K/mu L, and 3.08 +/- 2.18 K/mu L, respectively. NLRs of groups 1 and 2 were 2.80 +/- 2.25 and 4.59 +/- 2.97, respectively. The relationship between group 1 and 2 tumors was significant (p=0.008). NLR values were 3.82 +/- 2.49 and 5.20 +/- 3.25 in groups 2A and 2B, respectively. However, no significant relationship was found between these values (p=0.235). Conclusion: Although no positive correlation was found between NLR and lymph node density, we think that this inflammation marker is an invaluable parameter to predict lymph node metastasis.

This study aimed to assess the factors affecting the occurrence of modified Clavien-Dindo grade 2 or higher complications after PN. Materials and Methods: Data of patients who underwent PN due to renal cancer from January 2015 to June 2018 were prospectively collected. Database was analysed retrospectively by dividing into two groups with Clavien-Dindo grade 0-1 complications (group 1) and with grade 2 or higher complications (group 2). The resection technique was classified by the surgeon as enucleation, enucleo-resection or resection according to the Surface-Intermediate-Base (SIB) margin scores of 0, 1 and 2, respectively. Factors affecting the occurrence of grade 2 or higher complications were evaluated by univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Results: A total of 161 patients were included in the study. The overall rate of perioperative complications was 18.6%. Twenty-four patients (14.9%) had grade 2 or higher complications and 11 patients (6.8%) had serious complications (grade 3 or higher). SIB-score was 0 in 103 (63.9%) patients, 1 in 36 (22.4%) patients and 2 in 22 (13.7%) patients. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis revealed that the C-index [odds ratio (OR): 0.224, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.092-0.493, p=0.001], laparoscopic surgical technique (OR: 12.668, 95% CI: 2.825-59.326, p=0.001), and SIB-score 1-2 (OR: 2.852, 95% CI: 1.416-9.826, p=0.002) are independent factors in predicting complications of Clavien-Dindo grade 2 or higher. Conclusion: C-index, laparoscopic approach and resection techniques (SIB-score 1-2) are independent factors in predicting perioperative complications of Clavien-Dindo grade 2 or higher following PN.

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, the medical records of 152 consecutive patients who had undergone 12-core SB (n=105) or 12-core SB and COG-TB of suspicious lesions (n=47) and corresponding radical prostatectomy (RP) at our institution were evaluated. Biopsy and RP pathologies of the two methods were compared for downgrading, upgrading and concordance rates based on the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology grade groups (GG). Results: For COG-TB and SB cohorts, total upgrading rates were 21.3% and 26.7%, total downgrading 10.6% and 21.9% and concordance 68.1% and 51.4%, respectively, but the differences were not statistically significant. For GG 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, the concordance rates at COG-TB and SB were 69.6% versus 52.8%, 68.7% versus 83.1%, 75% versus 30.8%, 50% versus 9.1% and 50% versus 62.5%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in concordance rates regarding GG between COG-TB and SB groups. According to GG, there was also no significant difference in the rates of upgrading and downgrading of COG-TB and SB. Conclusion: Although COG-TB outperforms SB in terms of pathological upgrading, downgrading and concordance rates, COG-TB has no statistically significant advantage over SB in terms of predicting final RP pathology.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between histological changes and urodynamic findings in the NB. Materials and Methods: Patients undergoing radical cystectomy and Studer NB were included in the study. Patients with follow-up times <48 months were assigned to group 1 (n = 5) and those with follow-up times >48 months in group 2 (n = 6). Metabolic, endoscopic, histologic, urodynamic, and continence parameters were evaluated after surgery. Results: No metabolic disorders or pathology was observed in the endoscopy of any patients. Histological evaluation revealed a decreased chronic inflammation and villus length severity over the years, with increased goblet cell numbers and fibrosis rates. Maximum reservoir capacity, compliance, and voiding pressure values for groups 1 and 2 were 418 +/- 42.1 and 401.33 +/- 67.8 mL, 15.65 +/- 2.7 and 18.54 +/- 4.98 mL/cm H2O. and 28.2 +/- 2.28 and 30.6 +/- 7.4 cm H2O, respectively. Maximum reservoir capacity was higher in group 1 than in group 2, whereas compliance and voiding pressure were lower, without significant differences (p = 0.84, p = 0.64, and p = 0.97; respectively). Conclusion: No effects were observed on urodynamic parameters resulting from the development of long term histological changes in the NB. However, the NB appeared to adapt to its new function by gradually assuming a similar morphology to the urothelium, maintaining a sufficient capacity and compliance. Daytime continence was achieved at a rate of 90.9%, without metabolic pathology.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of our patients diagnosed with primary bladder cancers during 2000-2014. Patients with history of macroscopic haematuria were included. Their haematuria duration and frequency and stage and grade of bladder cancer, recurrence rates, time until recurrence, time until progression and pre-operative use of anticoagulants were evaluated. Results: A total of 331 patients comprising 276 males (83%) and 55 females (16%) were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 64.0 +/- 11.8 (28-93) years. The average haematuria duration was 18.5 +/- 33.5 (0-260) months. There were 173 (52%), 106 (32%) and 52 (15.7%) patients with cancer stages of Ta, T1 and T2, respectively. The average follow-up time was 54.0 +/- 41.8 (1-268) months. The frequency of haematuria was significantly higher in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancers than in those with superficial bladder cancers (p=0.010). Similarly, patients with tumour diameter >3 cm reported significantly higher frequency of haematuria than in those with tumour diameter <3 cm (p=0.045). Five patients exclude from study because they did not attend their follow-up. During follow-up recurrences were seen in 89 (32.3%) out of 326 patients, while 237 (72.7%) patients did have any recurrences. Disease progression was reported in 28 (8.5%) patients. The average time periods until recurrence and progression were 25.8 +/- 34.7 months and 27.1 +/- 34.9 (1-144) months, respectively. Conclusion: We found a significant difference between the frequency of haematuria in patients with muscle-invasive cancers and those with superficial cancers. Also, we found a negative correlation between smoking and the time until recurrence in patients with macroscopic haematuria. No significant relationships were observed between the duration of haematuria and cancer recurrence rates and prognosis.

Materials and Methods: An 18-item survey was e-mailed to 2305 certified Turkish urologists. The survey included questions designed to evaluate urologists' knowledge of chemotherapy procedures and their ability to manage complications, as well as how many of them perform systemic therapies and believe urologists should perform these therapies for urologic cancers. Results: We evaluated 305 responses. Most urologists (89.6%) perform hormonotherapy for prostate cancers. Further, the majority refer patients to medical oncologists for chemotherapy. Moreover, 65.9%, 70.8%, and 72.1% of the urologists believe that only medical oncologists should deliver chemotherapy for prostate, bladder, and testicular cancers, respectively. Only 23.9% of urologists believe they are competent to perform chemotherapy, while 16.7% believe they are capable of dealing with chemotherapy complications. Conclusion: Turkish urologists have a lack of performance and interest in administering systemic therapies in urologic cancers. We want to emphasize that urology is more than just surgery. Urologists should be involved in all stages of cancer treatment.

Materials and Methods: Professional medical translators independently performed the translation and backtranslation of the original English G8 questionnaire. Patients aged 70 years or older were included in the study. The final Turkish version of the G8 screening tool was administered to all patients, and internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The G8 screening tool was administered once more to the patients two weeks after the first administration to evaluate the test-retest reliability. Intraclass correlation coefficient test was used to evaluate the test-retest results. The construct validity of the scale was examined using the exploratory factor analysis. Results: One hundred and nineteen patients were included in the study. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.72, which indicated that the screening tool was internally consistent. According to the test-retest analysis, a strong correlation was noted between the test and retest results. When the answers to the same question in the test and retest were compared, they were similar, and this result was consistent with the correlation results. Conclusion: The Turkish version of the G8 screening tool was established in this study.

Safety of Robotic Surgery in Urological Cancers in Patients with Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt: A Report of Two Cases	UROONKOLOJI BULTENI-BULLETIN OF UROONCOLOGY			English	Article						Robotic surgery; ventriculoperitoneal shunt; urological cancers; radical prostatectomy	LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY; CHOLECYSTECTOMY	Patients with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) are at risk for shunt infection and failure during laparoscopic and robotic abdominal surgeries due to pneumoperitoneum. Herein, we present the first-ever report of robotic surgery in two uro-oncological cases with VPS in situ. The first patient underwent robotic radical cystectomy with intracorporeal ileal conduit formation for bladder cancer, whereas the second underwent radical prostatectomy for localized prostate carcinoma. Surgeries were performed in Trendelenburg position and intra-abdominal pressure of 10-12 mm Hg. Pneumoperitoneum time was 210 and 165 min, respectively. Both patients had an uneventful intraoperative and postoperative course, without any urological or neurological sequelae at 1 and 7 years follow-up, respectively. Prolonged robotic surgeries were safely performed with less insufflation pressure in the Trendelenburg position in patients with VPS. The shunt did not affect the ontological outcomes, operative time, blood loss, or rates of conversion to open procedure during robotic surgeries.	[Agarwal, Varun V.; Yuvaraja, T.

Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent RC in our clinic for muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) or high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) between 2006 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into four groups: LVI (-) and LN (-) patients were in group 1, LVI (+) and LN (-) patients were in group 2, LVI (-) and LN (+) patients were in group 3, and LVI (+) and LN (+) patients were in group 4. All data were compared among the groups. Results: A total of 177 patients with a mean age of 64.4 years and mean follow-up time of 30.2 months were evaluated in this study. The mean overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of the patients were 56.6 +/- 4.2 and 68.9 +/- 4.5 months, respectively. When factors affecting survival rates were analyzed, LN positivity was not a significant factor influencing the OS (p=0.570) and CSS (p=0.533) of the patients. However, LVI [p=0.002, hazard ratio (HR)=0.402] and surgical margin (SM) positivity (p=0.001, HR=0.321) were significant factors influencing OS. SM positivity (p=0.003, HR=0.314), LVI (p=0.011, HR=0.416), and adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) (p=0.009, HR=0.460) were also found to be independent factors affecting CSS. ACT was higher in group 3 than in other groups, and overall and cancer-specific mortality rates were lower in group 1 than in other groups. OS and CSS in group 2 (15.3 +/- 2.9 and 21.2 +/- 4.6 months, respectively) and group 4 (21.5 +/- 7.2 and 24.5 +/- 8.1 months, respectively) were lower than those in other groups (p<0.001). Conclusion: SM positivity and LVI are independent factors affecting OS and CSS. ACT, especially in group 3, could increase CSS. OS and CSS were lower in patients with LVI than in those without.

The child had acute exacerbation of symptoms which precipitated an emergency left radical nephrectomy and renal venectomy (due to densely adherent tumoral embolus in left renal vein and Inferior Vena Cava) indicated for intraperitoneal tumor rupture. Postoperative histopathology confirmed a Wilms tumor; classified as stage IIIc. He is on a three-drug chemotherapy and doing well on follow-up. Preoperative spontaneous Wilms tumor rupture is a dinico-radiological challenge. A high index of suspicion is a prerequisite for diagnosis. However, an upfront emergency radical nephrectomy should be discussed.

Materials and Methods: We included 44 patients with clinical stage T1 renal tumors who underwent laparoscopic partial nephrectomy between June 2018 and January 2020. Then, we performed abdominal cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. We recorded the warm ischemia time, operation time, and amount of intraoperative bleeding. The resulting changes were evaluated by determining preoperative, and third month postoperative creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR). RENAL nephrometry, Preoperative Aspects and Dimensions Used for an Anatomic (PADUA) classification and Diameter- Axial- Polar (DAP) scores were calculated for each patient. The relationship between a decline in renal function, duration of ischemia and RENAL/PADUA/DAP scores was equally explored to achieve the aim of the study. Results: The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 55.07 +/- 12.92 years, and the preoperative creatinine and eGFR values were 0.87 mg/dL and 93.17 mL/min, respectively. The third month postoperative creatinine and eGFRvalues were determined at 0.96 mg/dL and 86.52 mL/min, respectively. The mean RENAL (6.2 +/- 1.4), PADUA (6.8 +/- 1.0), and DAP (5.57 +/- 15) scores were also determined. Changes in creatinine and eGFR levels correlated significantly with RENAL/PADUA/DAP scores and the ischemia time (p<0.05), but not with the operation time, the amount of bleeding, length of hospital stay, tumor size, and location (p>0.05). Conclusion: Changes in kidney functions and ischemia time correlates significantly with RENAL/PADUA/DAP nephrometry scores.

J	Demirci, A; Sagnak, AL				Demirci, Aykut; Sagnak, Azmi Levent			Comparison between the Success of Prostate and Breast Cancer Awareness Campaigns over "Google Trends" in Turkey	UROONKOLOJI BULTENI-BULLETIN OF UROONCOLOGY			English	Article						Breast cancer; google trends; prostate cancer; awareness month	IMPACT; INTERNET	Objective: This study aimed to compare the success of breast and prostate cancer awareness campaigns using the search rates on the internet as an indicator of the public's interest in the subject. Materials and Methods: The periodic median search rates of the "breast cancer" and "prostate cancer" terms searched between January 2010 and December 2019 annually, 2010-2014 (first period), and 2015-2019 (second period) were compared over Google Trends (TM). The effect of the awareness campaigns and isolated rises (an increase of at least 25%) in the normal trend were evaluated. Results: It was observed that the median search rates for both cancer types increased in the second period (p<0.05). When trends were compared before and after the awareness months annually, an increase above the normal trend was detected for breast cancer (p<0.001). However, this increase was not observed in prostate cancer (p>0.05). Moreover, we found that the isolated rises for both types of cancer coincided with celebrity-related news covered in the media. Conclusion: Although breast cancer awareness was created in the society, it was determined that the situation was not the same for prostate cancer. More studies are needed to enlighten the public on prostate cancer, and Google Trends (TM) may be an important tool that can assist the follow-up on this subject.

On the other hand, with the development of surgical techniques, improvement in endoscopic instruments and better risk stratification in recent years, minimally invasive endoscopic procedures and renal-sparing surgical approaches such as segmental/total ureterectomy have begun to be applied. Metachronous tumor recurrences can be seen despite the use of renal-sparing approaches in selected patients. Adjuvant intraluminal treatments are applied in upper urinary tract tumors to reduce tumor recurrences. In this review, we discussed the role of adjuvant intraluminal therapies.

Metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer may be de novo metastatic, but also it may be in the localized disease stage at the time of diagnosis, and may present as biochemical relapse and later metastatic disease over time. Purposes of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer treatment are prolonging survival, improving quality of life and reducing complications. In this review, it is aimed to evaluate the current developments in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer treatment.

Fiducial markers (FMs) are one of the various methods for prostate localization. FMs for prostate RT have been in use for several years. This study aimed to evaluate the current trends in FM practices used in the treatment of prostate cancer in Turkey. Materials and Methods: An electronic survey containing 15 questions was developed on SurveyMonkey.net and sent to the email addresses of 600 radiation oncologists (ROs) via the Turkish Society for Radiation Oncology. Then, the data were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 33 ROs completed the survey. Upon analysis, results revealed that the mean FM experience duration was 6.6 years (range: 1-18 years). FM replacement was mainly done transrectally (90%) by urologists (67.7%). Antibiotic prophylaxis and anticoagulant cessation were often practiced. At least three gold FMs were inserted in most of the cases. Conclusion: Many centers use FMs for prostate RT in Turkey. There are some differences in FM usage. Standardization of the practice could help to investigate and improve FM utilization in prostate RT.

Materials and Methods: This study used the prostate cancer database from the Urooncology Association in Turkey. Clinical, surgical, pathological and follow-up data were recorded from the database. PSM features, including number, location, linear length and Gleason grade (GG) were also recorded. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed to assess differences in BCR-free survival (BCR-FS). In order to identify prognostic factors affecting BCR-FS, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed. Results: The study included 984 patients who met the eligibility criteria. The median follow-up time was 29 (minimum: 6, maximum: 210) months, and BCR was detected in 178 (18.1%) patients. BCR-FS was found to be significantly lower in patients with higher total prostate-specific antigen, higher International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade, extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node involvement, PSM and GG at PSM (PSMGG) >= 4 (log-rank p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001 and p=0.005). ISUP grade, EPE and PSM were identified as independent prognostic factors in predicting BCR-FS [Hazard ratio (HR): 1.89, p=0.035 and HR: 4.65, p<0.001, HR: 1.82, p=0.030, HR: 1.77, p=0.042, respectively]. Unlike the univariate analysis, in multivariate analysis, PSMGG did not prove to be an independent prognostic factor in predicting BCR-FS. Conclusion: PSM GG >= 4 was found to be significantly associated with shorter BCR-FS. There is a need for large, randomised prospective studies to clarify the role of PSMGG to be used in nomograms as an independent predictor to determine patients who would benefit from adjuvant radiation therapy.

A 12 years old boy presented with painless mass in the scrotum. Magnetic resonance imaging showed extratesticular, 4.7x3.8 centimeter, well-circumscribed solid mass with heterogenous high degree vascularity at the postcontrast series, deplasing right testicle to inferomedial. The patient underwent tumor resection without any complication. Histologic examination revealed 5x5x3 centimeter nodular mass containing uniform tubular adenomatous tumoral proliferation. Immunohistochemical examination of the tumor cells showed positivity for panCK, vimentin and WT1. A diagnosis of sertoliform cystadenoma was rendered in the case. The current case is the largest and the second pediatric case in the literature. Sertoliform cystadenoma is a benign extratesticular mass and can be treated with a testis sparing approach.

Materials and Methods: Further, 527 patients with high-risk prostate cancer were divided into two groups. In group 1 (n=139), neoadjuvant androgen deprivation treatment was administered prior to surgery, whereas it was not applied preoperatively in group 2 (n=388). Results: Biochemical progression was observed in 27 patients (19.4%) in group 1 and 54 patients (13.9%) in group 2 (p=0.148). Adjuvant and salvage irradiation were administered to patients with pT2 cancer who received neoadjuvant hvsormonal therapy in 17.3% and 7.1% of the cases, respectively, whereas in cases without prior neoadjuvant treatment, adjuvant and salvage irradiation were administered in 21.6% and 5.4% (p=0.370 and p=0.523). Clinically advanced cancer patients who received neoadjuvant hormonal treatment had adjuvant and salvage irradiation in 34.1% and 2.4% of the cases, whereas patients who did not receive neoadjuvant treatment had adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy in 35.9% and 7.6% of the cases (p=0.856 and p=0.278). Conclusion: Although neoadjuvant hormonal treatment improved local tumor control, it did not reduce the frequency of secondary radiotherapy significantly. Overall, and in the cT2 subgroup, there was a relative decrease in the number of adjuvant treatments compared to salvage treatments in neoadjuvant-treated patients.

The secondary aim was to evaluate the relation of SII with overall survival (OS). Materials and Methods: A total of 244 patients were included in the study. Patients were divided into the testicular tumor (group 1, n=184) and control group (group 2, n=60). Preoperative complete blood count, tumor markers, and imaging tests of the patients in group 1 were recorded. A subgroup analysis was performed according to the clinical stage, pathological stage, tumor type, and tumor size. Then, the effectiveness of TCa on SII was evaluated among the groups. Results: A significant difference was observed between the SII, neutrophil, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios between groups 1 and 2. The median SII was 719.92 in group 1 and 510.93 in group 2 (p<0.001). In the subgroup analysis, the median SII value was higher in patients with advanced disease stage and metastasis (p<0.001). In the receiver operating characteristics curve analysis, the area under the curve was 0.784, and the SII cut-off point was 719, with a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 65.4%. The median follow-up time was 55 (interquartile range, 8-132) months. Ten patients died of TCa. In the multivariable analysis, SII (7.6-fold increase; p=0.005) and presence of metastasis (4.3-fold increase; p=0.001) were independent predictors of OS. Conclusion: SII can be an important marker in the diagnosis and follow-up of TCa. However, SII needs to be evaluated using larger data, especially in the risk assessment in TCa.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 262 patients with primary, low-grade Ta bladder cancer. Recurrence was defined as the occurrence of a new tumour in the prostatic urethra or bladder. Tumour progression was defined as confirmed high-grade Ta, all T1 or carcinoma in situ, upper tract recurrence or progression to T2. The associations between factors that affect recurrence and progression were analysed. Results: Tumour recurrence and progression occurred in 119 (45.4%) and 25 (9.5%) patients during follow-up (median follow-up: 50.9 +/- 36.3 months), respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrate that smoking, multiple tumours and large tumours (3 cm<) were significant. A Cox regression analysis revealed that progression was identified as a significant risk factor on survival. There was no effect of smoking on recurrence-free survival. A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that one-, five- and ten-year progression-free survival rates were 99.6%, 88.2% and 70%, respectively. Conclusion: Multiple tumours, large tumours (>3 cm) and smoking were risk factors for recurrence and progression. Prevention of smoking and routine cystoscopic examination are essential in bladder cancer.

The aim of this multicentric retrospective study is to investigate the national trends and the effect of non-tumoral factors in the preference of NSS as treatment of T1 RT in Turkey. Materials and Methods: Relevant data for patients operated between 1997 and 2017 was collected from the Urologic Cancer Database-Kidney Urooncology Association, Turkey (UroCaD-K). Results: We included 3195 T1N0M0 RT patients in this study. There was a significant increase in the number of NSS performed with time, 9.26% between 1997-2002 to 54.78% between 2013-2017 (p<0.001). NSS proportion decreased with increasing age (p<0.001); but increased with better hospital facility (p<0.001). From multivariate analysis; younger age, later operation date, larger hospital size with higher nephrectomy centers like university hospitals were independently associated non-tumoral factors favoring NSS over radical nephrectomy (RN). Conclusion: We observed significant disparity in the use of NSS for T1 RT among the elderly (>61 years), small hospital size (<= 500 beds), lower nephrectomy volume (<100 nephrectomies/year), and Non-University Hospitals. This disparity can be resolved by persistent education of the residents and urologists with periodic courses and practical training, increasing the funds and strengthening the technical equipment of centers, thereby favoring the performance of NSS even in smaller centers. This will ensure that suitable patients are treated with NSS rather than RN, regardless of the hospital type.

Materials and Methods: A total of 78 male patients with prostate cancer (PCa) treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy between August 2015 and June 2020 were included in this study. In this cohort, suspicious lesions on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) were scored according to PI-RADS version-2 criteria. MpMRI-targeted prostate biopsy was performed for all suspicious lesions with a PI-RADS score of >= 3 followed by systematic prostate biopsy. The relationship between index lesion PI-RADS score and histopathological outcomes of prostatectomy specimens were evaluated statistically. Results: The mean age of the patients was 65.0 +/- 7.0 years. The distribution of PI-RADS scores of 3, 4, and 5 of the index lesions were 6 (7.7%), 29 (37.2%), and 43 (55.1%), respectively. Lower tumor volume and tumor volume ratio were observed in patients with a PI-RADS score of 3 when they were compared with patients with PI-RADS scores of 4 and PI-RADS-5 (p<0.001, for each). No significant correlation was found between index lesion PI-RADS score in mpMRI and clinically significant PCa in prostatectomy specimens (r<0.200, p>0.05). However, a significant correlation was observed between index lesion PI-RADS score and extracapsular extension (ECE), as well as seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and pT stage (r=0.327, p=0.004; r=0.276, p=0.014, r=0.348, p=0.002, respectively). Conclusion: Increased index lesion PI-RADS scores were associated with ECE, SVI, higher tumor volume, tumor volume ratio, and pT stages. Increased index lesion PI-RADS score in mpMRI may be helpful in prediction of locally advanced PCa in prostatectomy specimens.

Materials and Methods: In total, 72 patients treated with definitive RT or RP for high-risk PCa between 2011 and 2018 were included in the study. Patient characteristics, treatment data, and follow-up data were obtained from the patient's file. Results: Of 72 patients with high-risk PCa, 34 (46.6%) received definitive RT and ADT and 38 (52.1%) had undergone RP. The median follow-up time in the RP group was 44.5 (range, 14-100) months and that in the RP group was 48 (range, 9-108) months. No significant between-group difference was found in the biochemical recurrence-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and overall survival (OS) rates after 3 and 5 years of follow-ups (p >= 0.005). In a subgroup analysis, RT was the treatment of choice for patients aged >= 65 years and for those with prostate-specific antigen values of >= 20 ng/dL, a Gleason score (GS) of 9-10, and T stage T3-4 and N+ status (p=0.015, 0.001, 0.035, and 0.022, respectively). In the univariate and multivariate analyses, age z65 years and GS of 8-10 were significant risk factors for reduced OS in all high-risk PCa cases. Conclusion: No significant difference was found in the survival outcome of patients in the RT + ADT and RP groups. RT should be preferred in patients aged >= 65 years and in those with a high T stage and GS of 8-10.

Materials and Methods: Demographic, clinical and pathological data of 147 eligible patients were included in the study. All patients underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. Patients were divided into two groups; those with biopsy-proven prostate cancer (group 1) and those with only benign pathological findings (group 2). Later, two subgroups were formed among the patients diagnosed with prostate cancer (group 1); patients with serum 25 (OH) D levels above and below 20 ng/mL. All groups and subgroups were compared regarding clinical and pathological parameters. Finally, patients were divided according to International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade groups. Results: Serum 25 (OH) D level of patients with prostate cancer (group 1: 15.6 +/- 7.0 ng/mL) was slightly lower than the non-cancer group (group 2: 16.0 +/- 9.2 ng/mL) (p=0.38). On analysis of variance, there was a statistically significant difference between ISUP grade 1, grade 2-3 and grade 4-5 (p=0.012). Patients with clinically insignificant prostate cancer (ISUP grade 1) had significantly higher serum 25 (OH) D levels than other prostate cancer patients (p=0.023). There was a weak negative correlation between serum 25 (OH) D levels and ISUP grades (r=-0.319, p=0.01). Conclusion: There was no association between the diagnosis of prostate cancer and vitamin D deficiency. However, promising results have been obtained in favour of prostate cancer aggressiveness in vitamin D deficiency.

UROONKOLOJI BULTENI-BULLETIN OF UROONCOLOGY			English	Article						Germ cell testicular cancer; chemotherapy; cisplatin; stroke; thromboembolism	CANCER; RISK	Among males aged between 15 and 35 years, testicular cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer. Testicular germ cell tumours are generally considered curable and respond dramatically to adjuvant treatment. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens are used ubiquitously, inevitably leading to iatrogenic morbidity. Herein, we represent a case of a patient diagnosed with a non-seminomatous germ cell tumour, who underwent adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy treatment and subsequently developed an acute ischemic stroke. In cancer patients, a malignancy-induced hypercoagulability state can cause thromboembolic events. Nonetheless, anti-cancer therapy may dramatically increase the risk of thromboembolic events, by analogue mechanisms, such as the release of pro-coagulant mediators, direct endothelial injury or stimulation of tissue factor production by host cells. Among various chemotherapy agents correlated with thromboembolism, cisplatin is expected to carry a higher risk for thromboembolic complications. Acute cerebrovascular events secondary to anti-neoplastic agents require an interdisciplinary approach, including referral to more experienced centres when needed.

Testicular tumors are separated mainly into two groups; germ cell tumors (teratoma, yolk sac tumors, epidermoid cyst) and gonadal stromal tumors (Juvenile granulosa cell, Leydig cell, and Sertoli cell tumors). Paratesticular tumors can either be lipomas, leiomyomas, hemangiomas, or rhabdomyosarcomas. Physical examination, serum markers, and the scrotal ultrasound have an important role in their diagnosis. Testes-sparing surgery is gaining more grounds in children owing to the dominancy of benign tumors. In malignant tumors, radical orchiectomy and selective chemotherapy are standard approaches. Radiotherapy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection have a minimal role in treatment.

Materials and Methods: The records of 340 patients who underwent standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS-SB) and cognitive targeted biopsy (COG-TB) between June 2015 and January 2020 at our institute were retrospectively reviewed and included in the study. There were 185 patients in the TRUS-SB (12-core) group and 155 patients in the COG-TB (12-core + 2 lesions) group. Patients undergoing COG-TB underwent 3-T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging before the biopsy procedure and were evaluated with the prostate imaging reporting and data system version 2. The rates of any prostate cancer and CSPCa were compared between groups. Results: The patient mean ages were determined as 64.02 +/- 5.15 and 64.41 +/- 3.93 years for the TRUS-SB and COG-TABLO groups, respectively. Any prostate cancer was detected in 38/185 patients (20.54%) in the TRUS-SB group, and 44/155 patients (28.38%) in the COG-TB group. CSPCa rates were determined as 57.80% (22/38 patients), and 56.8% (25/44) for the TRUS-SB and COG-TB groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding cancer (p=0.092) and CSPCa detection rates (p=0.843). Conclusion: In our study, no significant difference was found between the overall prostate cancer and clinically important prostate cancer detection rates between the TRUS-SB and COG-TB groups.

J	Aslan, G				Aslan, Guven			Multiparametric MRI Fusion-guided Biopsy for the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: Results of the First 100 Consecutive Patients	UROONKOLOJI BULTENI-BULLETIN OF UROONCOLOGY			English	Article						Prostate cancer; detection; targeted biopsy; MRI US Fusion; prostate biopsy		Objective: Our aim was to compare prostate cancer detection rates according to International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group (GG) among magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsies (TBx), systematic biopsies (SBx) and a combination of both (TBx + SBx). Materials and Methods: Between July 2018 and Nov 2020, 100 patients undergoing MRI-targeted prostate biopsy and SB were analysed retrospectively. Men with MRI-visible prostate lesions underwent both MRI-targeted (UroNav (R)) and systematic 12-core biopsy. The primary outcome was cancer detection according to ISUP GG. The secondary outcome were detection of cancers of GG 2 or higher. Results: The overall cancer detection rate in the study was 43%. Among these, a histopathological ISUP grade of 1 was detected in 44.2%, ISUP grade 2 in 32.5% and higher-grade groups in 23.2% of patients. MRI-TB detected 38 and SBx biopsy detected 30 of the overall study cohort. Combined biopsy led to a cancer diagnoses in 18 more men than with either method alone. Significant cancer detection was 53.4% for TBx, 39.5% for SBx, and highest 55.8% for combination TBx + SBx (p=0.038). Most of the cancers missed by SBx were clinically significant. No significant side effects were recorded. The overall cancer detection rate was 20.4%/46.6% and 90.2% for prostate imaging reporting and data system 3/4/5, respectively. Conclusion: Our results have shown that among patients with lesions visible on MRI, combined biopsy led to greater detection of all prostate cancers, providing increased detection of clinically significant tumours.

J	Selvi, I; Arik, AI; Basay, MS; Basar, H				Selvi, Ismail; Arik, Ali Ihsan; Basay, Mehmet Sinan; Basar, Halil			Oncological Outcomes of Bilateral Testicular Germ Cell Tumors and Evaluation of Prognostic Risk Factors	UROONKOLOJI BULTENI-BULLETIN OF UROONCOLOGY			English	Article						Bilateral; metachronous; synchronous; testicular dysgenesis syndrome; testicular germ cell tumour	CANCER; EXPERIENCE; MUTATIONS; TESTIS	Objective: The incidence of bilateral testicular germ cell tumours (TGCT) is low and constitutes 0.5%-7% of all testicular tumours. We aimed to evaluate the clinical and pathological features of unilateral and bilateral TGCT, as well as prognostic factors in bilateral cases that may have an impact on oncological outcomes. Materials and Methods: Bilateral TGCT were detected in 10 (11.4%) of 87 patients between January 2010 and July 2016. Patients with 68 unilateral and 10 bilateral tumours (4 synchronous, 6 metachronous) had completely accessible data. We retrospectively evaluated their clinical-pathological data and postoperative follow-up results. Results: Four patients with bilateral synchronous tumours had a seminoma and three (75%) of them had a stage III disease. At a median follow-up of 31.50 (29-37) months, local recurrence, distant metastasis and death were observed in two patients with stage III disease. No recurrence or metastasis was seen in six patients with unilateral TGCT at 33 (24-50) months of follow-up, but metachronous tumours occurred in the contralateral testicles. At a median follow-up of 25 (11-39) months after metachronous tumour development, local recurrence, distant metastasis and death were observed in the contralateral testis of patients with stage III disease. There was no significant difference in bilateral and unilateral cases for disease-free survival, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). PFS and OS were significantly shorter (p=0.039) in bilateral synchronous tumours than in metachronous tumours. Moreover, stage III disease was more common (75% vs 33.3%) in synchronous tumours. Family history (OR: 6.556, p=0.035), testicular dysgenesis syndrome (OR: 3.876, p=0.031), disorders of semen parameters (OR: 2.879, p=0.037), undescended testis (OR: 2.561, p=0.026), monocyte/lymphocyte ratio >0.31 [odds rotio (OR): 2.234, p=0.022], testicular microlithiasis (OR: 2.015, p=0.015) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio >3.23 (OR: 1.348, p=0.025) increased the risk of contralateral tumour development. Conclusion: Bilateral synchronous tumours are detected at a more advanced stage and have lower PFS and OS durations, but survival rates are similar to those of unilateral tumours. Long-term follow-up is necessary for patients with unilateral TGCT having certain risk factors due to the possibility of metachronous tumour development in the contralateral testis.

This study aimed to present a case of isolated pulmonary metastasis during the follow-up after radical prostatectomy, in which recurrence was not detected for 2 years after metastasectomy. The patient was on follow-up without any treatment for 22 months, with an unobservable prostate-specific antigen value. Metastasectomy in oligometastatic disease has emerged as a treatment option in recent years but is not considered a standard treatment. Literature contribution is necessary for oligometastatic disease definition to clarify its nature and compare treatment options.

Limited data is available about local treatment outcomes in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) having clinical lymph node involvement. Materials and Methods: Using the national PCa database, patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and pelvic lymph node dissection between 2001 and 2019, with pathologic lymph node involvement, were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups as those with and without clinical lymph node involvement by preoperative imaging. Results: A total of 213 patients were included in the final analysis, wherein 164 are with and 49 are without lymph node involvement. After the mean follow-up periods of 33.9 months, a significant difference was not found between the two groups in terms of recurrence, adjuvant treatment necessity, and final status. The multivariate analysis for 5-year PSA recurrence-free survival revealed that surgical margin positivity was the only significant factor (p=0.016, hazard ratio: 2.67, confidence interval: 1.19-5.98). Conclusion: Our results revealed that preoperative clinical lymph node status did not affect the 5-year PSA recurrence-free survival in pathologic lymph node involvement of patients treated with RP and pelvic lymph node dissection. Therefore, RP stands as an effective treatment option in selected patients with PCa having clinical lymph node involvement.

So, predicting clinically significant PCa (CSPCa) will prevent unnecessary biopsies, overdiagnoses, and overtreatment of patients. Thus, we aimed at demonstrating the predictive ability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density (PSAD) and f/t PSA in revealing CSPCa (Gleason score >= 7) in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer on biopsy with a PSA level of 2.5-10 ng/mL. Materials and Methods: We evaluated 78 patients with PSA 2.5-10.0 ng/mL who underwent transrectal ultrasound guided (TRUSG)-guided prostate biopsy in our clinic between March 2017 and August 2020 and whose histology reported as prostate adenocarcinoma. In addition to the demographic content of the patients, PSA, free PSA, prostate size (with TRUSG), rectal examination findings, and prostate biopsy results were recorded. Clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as a minimum Gleason score of 7. Results: The mean age of the patients was 66.9 +/- 8.4 years, PSA value was 6.9 +/- 1.8 ng/mL, free/total PSA ratio was 18 +/- 8.1%, and PSAD was 0.150 +/- 0.078. The p-values of PSA, free PSA, PSAD, f/t PSA, and prostate volume between CSPCa and N- CSPCa groups were 0.010, 0.780, 0.001, 0.084, and 0.030, respectively. The area under the curve of the PSAD for predicting CSPCa was 0.719 with a 95% CI (0.604-0.835), and the standard errors were 0.062 and 0.059, respectively. When PSAD cut-off was 0.130 for predicting CSPCa, sensitivity and specificity rates were 75% and 63%, respectively. Conclusion: PSAD can be used in predicting CSPCa, but not f/t PSA. PSAD is not a strong stand-alone tool owing to its sensitivity and specificity, but can be a part of future nomograms for predicting CSPCa and future protocols for active surveillance.

Intravesical chemo immunotherapies are used to lower the risk of progression in patients who are at risk. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy is the most effective adjuvant therapy discovered. We aimed to evaluate the levels of arginine, citrulline, ornithine, symmetrically dimethylated arginine (SDMA), N-monomethyl-Larginine. (L-NMMA) or asymmetrically dimethylated arginine (ADMA) in patients with BC, as well as their relationship with methylarginine. Materials and Methods: Blood samples were collected from all patients (n=30) and controls (group 1) prior to transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) (group 2), 20 days after TURBT (group 3) and at the end of intravesical immunotherapy 74 (group 4). The levels of serum methylated arginine were measured using ABSCIEX API 3200 tandem mass spectrometry system in positive ESI mode. Results: In comparison to group 2, group 1's ADMA and arginine/total methylated arginine levels were 98 significantly lower (p=0.035 and p=0.049, respectively), while SDMA/ADMA, L-NMMA and arginine/ADMA levels (p=0.001, p=0.008 and p=0.017) increased, and no statistical difference was found for other parameters (p>0.05). When compared to group 3, ADMA, arginine, citrulline, methylated arginines and L-NMMA levels in group 2 (p=0.035, p=0.001, p=0.015, p=0.032, p=0.032) increased, while SDMA/ADMA levels (p=0.041) decreased. Conclusion: The decrease in arginine and ADMA levels in non-muscle invasive BC patients is thought to be promising, and these markers may be useful in monitoring the diagnosis and treatment of patients.

J	Turgut, H; Ozgur, GK				Turgut, Hasan; Ozgur, Guner Kemal			The Effect of an Animation Video and Music on Anxiety and Pain Scores Before TRUS-guided Biopsy	UROONKOLOJI BULTENI-BULLETIN OF UROONCOLOGY			English	Article						Anxiety; pain score; transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy	PROSTATE BIOPSY; DECREASES ANXIETY; DISSATISFACTION	Objective: The aim of this investigation is to investigate the effect of a pre-procedure animated video and music on blood pressure, pain score, anxiety score and pulse rate in patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsy. Materials and Methods: One hundred and two male patients who underwent a TRUS-guided prostate biopsy were randomised into two groups. A control group: no music or with a video included (n=51) and an experimental group: pre-education with an animation video and music included (n=51) during the procedure. Before and after the TRUS biopsy, the state-anxiety inventory score (STAI), pain visual analogue scale (VAS), heart rate and blood pressure were obtained from each patient and compared. Blood pressure and pulse were recorded by the urologist. Student's t-test and a paired t-test were used for variables with a normal distribution and Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon-rank tests were used for variables that did not show a normal distribution (p<0.05). Results: There were no differences prostate-specific antigen, age and prostate volume between the two groups. VAS, STAI scores and pulses differed between the two groups before and after the procedure. There was no difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure values before the procedure. However, a significant difference was found between the two groups regarding these values after the procedure. There was a statistically significant difference in the VAS, STAI, blood pressures and pulse rates after the procedure compared with the pre-procedure values (p<0.05). Conclusion: Watching the animation video and listening to music positively affected patients' anxiety, pain score, blood pressure and pulse values. This method is a low-cost, readily available application, which might be preferred by particular patient groups.
