Some results show that opening the downstream plate significantly decreases both the value and fluctuation of the aerodynamic forces for cases without crosswind; the maximum decreases can be up to 14.19% and 72.15%, respectively, and the effect of opening the downstream plate on the value and fluctuation of the aerodynamic forces on the upstream plate and base are aggravated and weakened by crosswind, respectively. For cases without crosswind, the flow field distribution law (velocity and pressure) around plates is not affected by opening the downstream plate, but their amplitude is obviously affected by opening the downstream plate. A crosswind significantly changes the flow field around the plates and base and strengthens the effect of opening the downstream plate on the flow field around models. Therefore, opening the downstream plate may weaken the effect of aerodynamic braking, and the location of the downstream plate relative to the upstream plate should be carefully considered.

Too much fluctuation in contact forces leads to either accelerated wear of the contacting components or losses of contact and, consequently, arcing. In this work, inertance-integrated pantograph damping systems are investigated with the objective of reducing the contact force standard deviation. Firstly, a multibody pantograph model is developed with its accuracy compared with experimental data. The model is improved through the calibration of the pantograph head suspension parameters and the introduction of both non-ideal joint and flexibility effects. Using the calibrated model, beneficial inertance-integrated damping systems are identified for the pantograph suspension. The results show that the configuration with one inerter provides the best performance among other candidate layouts and contends a 40% reduction of the maximum standard deviation of the contact force over the whole operating speed range in the numerical modelling scenario analysed. Considering the identified configuration, time-domain analysis and modal analysis are investigated. It has been shown that the achieved improvement is due to the fact that with the beneficial inertance-integrated damping system, the first resonance frequency of the pantograph system coincides with the natural frequency of the catenary system.

J	Luo, J; Zhu, SY; Zhai, WN				Luo, Jun; Zhu, Shengyang; Zhai, Wanming			Theoretical modelling of a vehicle-slab track coupled dynamics system considering longitudinal vibrations and interface interactions	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Vehicle-track dynamics; traction conditions; longitudinal vibrations; longitudinal interface interactions; Dahl friction model; bilinear cohesive zone model	BRIDGE INTERACTION ANALYSIS; LOADING-HISTORY; TRAINS SUBJECT; I FAILURE; ELEMENT; FRACTURE; ESTABLISHMENT; BRAKING; DAMAGE	Traction or braking operations are usually applied to the motor cars or locomotives for acceleration and deceleration, especially in perilous mountain high-speed railways that have complex and large gradient sections. Under such a circumstance, the wheel-rail longitudinal interactions may become more intense, which could induce longitudinal impact on the track structure. In this paper, some new concepts are introduced to account for this rarely concerned issue. Two typical interface interactions for a slab track system are fully considered, involving the longitudinal resistance between the rail and rail pad based on the Dahl friction model, and the longitudinal cohesive force between the prefabricated slab and CA (cement asphalt) mortar layer based on the bilinear cohesive zone model. By introducing system longitudinal vibrations and implementing the interface interactions into the classical vehicle-track system, a novel vehicle-slab track vertical-longitudinal coupled dynamics model is established, and investigated under the combined excitation of rail irregularities and polygonal wheel wear in traction conditions. Results indicate that the developed model is capable of capturing the longitudinal interactions between the track structures and enables considering initiation or evolution of the damage at the interface between the track slab and CA mortar subjected to complex train dynamic loads.

To guarantee the security of cargo on wagons, proper blocking, bracing and lashing are essential. In this study, we implement a cargo-wagon-rail coupling model that adopts diagonal lashing to restrain cargo movement. A preliminary dynamic simulation analysis demonstrates that the selected cargo tilts when the wagon negotiates curves. The quasi-static analysis reveals the cargo force condition and the key role of lashing stiffness. Coupling models are endowed with various lashing stiffness values. The curving performance of each model is evaluated considering different running conditions. The results indicate that increasing lashing stiffness reduces lateral cargo vibration and increases lashing tension force until the stable state. The cargo movement in this study is proved to have no significant effect on the wheel-rail interaction. Based on simulation results, this paper determines the diagonal lashing. It is demonstrated that the use of dynamic simulation to calculate the diagonal lashing force will improve cargo stability and avoid unnecessary expenditure on load restraint assemblies. Finally, it is proved that the promotion of pre-tension force is not necessary for diagonal lashings.

Track segment automated characterisation via railway-vehicle-based random vibration signals and statistical time series methods	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Track segment characterisation; on-board vibration based methods; statistical time series methods; stochastic models; railway vehicles; condition based monitoring	DAMAGE DETECTION; IDENTIFICATION; MAINTENANCE; INSPECTION	The feasibility of automated railway track segment characterisation, as part of a broader track condition based maintenance procedure, is explored via railway-vehicle-based random vibration signals and Statistical Time Series (STS) methods. In particular, three methods within a Multiple Model (MM) framework, which are founded on data-driven stochastic parametric models for the representation of the partial vehicle-rail dynamics, are employed. The random vibration signals are obtained from two sensors, which are mounted on the axlebox and the bogie frame, respectively, of an Athens Metro railway vehicle moving under three different speeds (60, 70 or 80 km/h). The performance assessment of the methods is based on two distinct track characterisation problems. The first corresponds to the characterisation of a specific track segment after 6 months of continuous use, while the second to the comparison between two nominally identical track segments which were installed with a 2 month time interval and are used by different numbers and types of trains. The results indicate deterioration of the track segment in the first characterisation problem and differences between the two nominally identical segments in the second. The superiority of the employed methods over a state-of-the-art method is also demonstrated via proper comparisons.	[Iliopoulos, I. A.; Sakellariou, J. S.; Fassois, S.

The initial database contained 5126 Web Of Science records published between 1975 and 2019 (45 years). The linguistic analysis determined the evolution of burst terms and grouped the papers in 14 clusters that corresponded with the view of the specialists in the field. 'Railway vehicle', 'Curved track' (hunting stability and derailment risk), 'Unconventional railway truck', 'Railway turnout (crossing)' and 'Polygonal wear' clusters were analysed in more detail with a determination of top-cited papers in each cluster and papers that determined connections between clusters (pivotal papers). Two pivotal papers were verified with their authors.

Experimental analysis of the influence of the passengers on flexural vibrations of railway vehicle carbodies	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Passengers; railway vehicle carbody; flexural vibration; damping; modal analysis	SEATED HUMAN-BODY; APPARENT MASS; CAR-BODY; VERTICAL VIBRATION; MATHEMATICAL-MODELS; EXPOSURE; COMFORT; POSTURE	It has been recently pointed out that railway vehicle passengers do not behave as inert masses but as dissipative elements: they increase modal damping without significantly affecting the natural frequencies of the carbodies. The phenomenon is more prominent in current lightweight high-speed railway vehicles, because weight reduction is usually attained at the expense of reduced stiffness. The few works that deal with the influence of passengers in actual structures are confronted with a large number of coupled structural vibration modes with cumbersome mode shapes, and this hinders the understanding of the physical mechanisms that make passengers attenuate vibrations. This work sheds some light on this topic from three points of view: new experimental tests on an actual carbody to corroborate and broaden existing results; simplified experimental tests, with small living beings (toddlers and pets) on a simplified pinned-pinned beam without modal coupling, to better determine the physical phenomena involved in the interaction between the passenger and the flexible structure; and improved analytical beam-cushion-passenger models to clarify the experimental results. All results suggest that passengers do indeed behave as classical dynamic vibration absorbers the positions of which with respect to the anti-nodes of mode shapes is key in vibration attenuation.

Rail-wheel contact forces and track irregularity estimation from on-board accelerometer data	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Rail-wheel contact forces; track irregularities; feed forward neural network; multi-body simulation		Rolling stock approval protocols, such as UIC 518, demand monitoring of lateral and vertical forces at rail-wheel contact. Continuous monitoring through on-board instrumentation needs algorithms to convert the on-board sensor data into rail-wheel forces and track irregularities. In this work a Feed Forward Neural Network architecture, for fast and accurate estimation of rail-wheel forces and track irregularities from data obtained from a cluster of accelerometers mounted on the rolling stock, is presented. Simulation study is conducted for a passenger coach running over numerically generated set of one hundred rail tracks, each with a different irregularity. Power spectral density (PSD) function of ERRI B176 is used for creating rail irregularities. Multi-body rail coach model consists of wheel-sets, axle-box, bogie, bolster and car body. The input comprises acceleration, yaw and roll rate data from axle-box, bogie and car body, to produce contact forces and rail irregularities as outputs. Goodness of fit between actual and estimated values is illustrated through point-by-point graphs of actual and estimated track forces and irregularities. R-Squared (R-2) values, representing the fraction by which the variance of errors are less than the variance of actual values, are computed as indices of the accuracy of estimates.

J	Tomiati, N; Magnani, G; Marcon, M				Tomiati, Nicolo; Magnani, Gianantonio; Marcon, Marco			An experimental investigation of the bicycle motion during a hands-on shimmy	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Shimmy; wobble; bicycle; vibrations; data acquisition system; inertial measurement unit	WOBBLE	This paper presents original data records of linear accelerations and angular velocities of six points of a racing bicycle collected during a 'genuine' hands-on shimmy. The records, together with GPS, forward speed data, and action cam videos are thoroughly analysed to understand the actual motion of the bicycle and its parts, at lower (weave) and higher (wobble or shimmy) frequencies. The main goal is to assess how and to what extent each part, and what compliances, are involved in the shimmy mechanism. In particular, the motions of the front and rear frames, and thus of the whole bicycle, during shimmy are carefully rebuilt. At higher frequencies, the rear frame rotates rigidly about an axis parallel to the yaw axis, while it undergoes a relative torsion between the head tube and the dropouts in the longitudinal (roll) direction. Likewise, the front frame rotates rigidly about the steering axis (in the entire frequency range), while it bends laterally consistently with the rear frame torsion. Although the overall motion is very complex, these results validate and extend models, conjectures, and theoretical results of the scientific literature about shimmy.

J	Beal, CE; Brennan, S				Beal, Craig E.; Brennan, Sean			Modeling and friction estimation for automotive steering torque at very low speeds	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article							DESIGN	The torque developed in the steering system of an automobile is a result of multiple interactions between a tyre and the roadway surface. Models are well established for high-speed ground vehicle operation where the tyre is rolling rapidly and the dominant source of tire tread stress is deformation due to lateral force on the tyre. In contrast, for situations where the vehicle is operating at low speeds or even steering when stationary, the torque required to turn the wheels is predominantly a function of the steering rate. However, the torque still can be predicted using models of the deformation of the tyre rubber. This paper introduces such a model of the tyre dynamics that considers the low-speed tyre deformation behaviour considering the interacting effects of steering while the tyre is slowly rolling, allowing for the prediction of steering torques during low speed manoeuvring. The physics-based model is validated with steering torque data from an instrumented steer-by-wire vehicle. The validated model also allows for opportunistic friction estimation in certain steady conditions by inversion of the model with the steering rate, steering torque, and vehicle speed as input data.

J	Jurisch, M				Jurisch, Matthias			Vertical trajectory planning: an optimal control approach for active suspension systems in autonomous vehicles	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Autonomous driving; optimal control; trajectory planning; comfort; active suspension; vertical dynamics	IMPLEMENTATION	In this paper, a new control algorithm for active suspension systems is presented. Latter is designed to improve low frequency comfort, which gains importance with autonomous driving and the possibility for nondriving tasks like in-car working. The algorithm is based on model predictive controllers and makes use of environment sensor information and extends preview by taking the future trajectory of the vehicle into account. A simulative benchmark demonstrates the advantages compared to existing control algorithms. Vertical- as well as roll- and pitch-acceleration can be significantly reduced by at least 20% compared to a non-preview controller up to a frequency of 5 Hz. A prototype vehicle implementation of the new controller enables a subjective and objective review of the resulting vehicle motion and confirms the results of the simulation. Despite of limitations on the precision of the preview information, vertical acceleration could be reduced by 5.5% in this implementation. It was shown that a future series implementation is possible and can be used to improve autonomous driving comfort by increasing low frequency suspension performance and efficient integration of additional features such as curve tilting.

The nonlinearities of the rubber bushing existing in the elastic element, the friction element and the viscous element are involved in the model to reflect the frequency- and amplitude-dependent characteristics of the rubber bushing. The experimental data are collected and exploited to find out the relationship between the input and output with the help of the neural network model. Furthermore, the influences of the environmental temperature on the dynamic parameters of the rubber bushing are considered. By testing the dynamic performance of the rubber bushing under the excitation with different frequencies, amplitudes and temperatures, the hybrid neural network model is trained and its critical parameters are identified. In this way, the trained hybrid neural network model for the rubber bushing can accurately reflect the dynamic performance in the presence of various excitation and environment temperatures.

J	Zhou, YC; Shi, ZY; Hecht, M				Zhou, Yichang; Shi, Zhiyong; Hecht, Markus			Comparison of friction draft gear models for simulation in longitudinal train dynamics	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Draft gear models; transitional strategies; &#8216; Zhai&#8217; method; benchmark cases; LTD		The friction draft gear with hysteresis characteristics is one of the typical nonlinear elements in longitudinal train dynamics (LTD). Due to the nonlinear hysteresis of friction damping, the discontinuity between loading and unloading envelopes becomes a mathematical integration issue when adopting look-up table methods to establish draft gear models. It might cause integration divergence and wrong results if ignored. To solve this discontinuity, three different transitional strategies (velocity-dependent, intermediate slope, and smoothing approximation) are applied to building draft gear models, and the one-dimensional (1D) longitudinal train model adopting the 'Zhai' integration method is used. To ensure accurate results, the international benchmark cases of LTD are studied, and three draft gear models with different transitional strategies are compared in this paper. The results show that these three models can successfully work with 'Zhai' method in the LTD simulation to achieve the force agreement with benchmark cases. Compared to the other two models, the velocity-dependent model doesn't exhibit good buffer deflection agreement and requires a smaller step size to achieve convergent results. Therefore, it is recommended that adopting the intermediate slope method or smoothing approximation approach avoids discontinuity problems of modelling draft gears in LTD.

J	Na, XX; Cole, DJ; Li, G				Na, Xiaoxiang; Cole, David J.; Li, Gang			Two Nash-equilibrium-based steering control models for representing a driver's interaction with vehicle automated steering	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Driver; automated steering; game theory; Nash equilibrium; experiment; model identification		Automated steering technology offers significant benefits to the safety of vehicles, but desire to keep the human driver in the loop requires a better understanding of the interaction between driver and vehicle. An existing noncooperative-game-theoretic framework for modelling such interaction is revisited, leading to the development of two driver steering control models. Both bear Nash-equilibrium properties, but involve different assumptions about driver steering behaviour. A simulation study is performed to demonstrate the difference between the two driver models. An experiment using a fixed-base driving simulator is conducted to measure six test subjects' steering angles in response to the lane-change manoeuvres generated by an automated steering controller. The two driver models' capabilities for representing driver steering behaviour are investigated through fitting them to measured driver steering angles. Key model parameters are identified using a system identification procedure. It is found that the two driver models have equivalent capability in capturing the trend of the six test subjects' measured steering angles, but less good at reproducing the overshoot and oscillation involved in two subjects' steering angles. It is found that the inclusion of an arm neuromuscular system model can improve the performance of the proposed driver models.

A series of tests and theory analysis were conducted to figure out the mechanism of wheel high-order polygonal wear. The wheel out-of-roundness (OOR) measurement results show that the wheels exhibit polygonal wear with 12-14 harmonics, which are very different from other metro train wheels reported in the literature. The investigation results indicate that the first bending vibration of the wheelset is the root cause of wheel high-order polygonal wear. Rail corrugation with a wavelength of 200 mm in the 1/3-octave band on sharply curved tracks is the main excitation source of the first bending vibration of the wheelset. The formation process and key influencing factors of wheel high-order polygonal wear are analysed in detail. Three measures are suggested to mitigate the formation of wheel high-order polygonal wear.

J	Ji, YJ; Ren, LH; Huang, YP				Ji, Yuanjin; Ren, Lihui; Huang, Youpei			Passive radial mechanism of a bogie with the auxiliary steering device for the straddle monorail vehicle	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Auxiliary steering device; curving performance; monorail vehicle; parameter optimisation; radial mechanism		The dynamic performance of the vehicle is improved when the bogie of a monorail vehicle passes through the curve in the radial position. This study aimed to derive the analytical relationship between the torque generated by the auxiliary guiding device and the yaw angle between the bogie and the vehicle body based on the geometric relationship between the auxiliary guiding device of the straddle monorail and the mechanical characteristics of the hydropneumatic spring. The main influencing factors were the angle of the arm and the initial pre-pressure of the hydropneumatic spring. Theoretical analysis and model simulation showed that the output torque of the auxiliary steering device had a linear relationship with the pre-pressure of the hydropneumatic spring, but a complex relationship with the angle of the rotating arm. When the reasonable pre-pressure (12.4 kN) of the hydraulic spring was selected, the output torque of the auxiliary steering device could be offset against the moment generated by the secondary suspension. At this time, the yaw angle of the running part was close to zero, and the bogie could be placed in the radial position on the circular curve, thus effectively reducing the wear of the running wheel and guiding wheel.

A common workflow for prediction of railway wheel polygonization is presented including assumptions, simulation scheme, and wear models. Based on this workflow, some rules for the evolution of railway wheel polygonization are proposed providing innovative perspectives to understand the basic mechanism of railway wheel polygonization. After summarising these rules, the general conditions for railway wheel polygonal wear to evolve are established. The phase between the instantaneous wear depth and the excitation is the key indicator determining the wheel OOR (Out-Of-Roundness) evolution direction (to grow or to diminish). The evolution tendency curve obtained from the instantaneous wear FRF (Frequency Response Function) is a useful tool to predict the OOR evolution, especially for predicting the OOR order that would grow predominantly at a given speed. If one or more structural modes can dominate the evolution tendency curve, and the energy distribution of track excitation allows this/these structural modes to be excited effectively, corresponding OOR orders can occur dominantly.

This is usually because track alignments in the turnout area are very poor and the cross-sections of switch rail are not uniform. Most previous studies focused on derailments in straight or curved lines. For this reason, understanding the derailment mechanism in turnouts and revealing the influence of the wheelset motion conditions on dynamic derailment behaviour are fundamental for the development of the required dynamic derailment criteria. For this paper, a half-vehicle multi-body dynamic model for derailment simulation was established and validated. Then, the effect of three different running cases with different wheelset motion conditions was further analysed. The results show that the variable cross-sections of switch rail along the longitudinal direction with a small contact angle are the root cause of the wheel climb derailment when compared with straight and curved lines. The wheels start climbing the switch rail at regions of rail top width from 5 to 20 mm. If the effect of the switch rail is ignored, the derailment risk in the guide curve is significantly reduced. This paper can contribute to the mitigation of derailment in railway turnouts as well as to the development of safety assessment criteria.

Full-scale derailment tests on freight wagons	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Full-scale derailment test; freight train; derailment detector; derailer		Reducing derailments of freight trains is of utter importance for improving railway transportation since derailments lead to large service disruption, economic losses and risk related to transported goods. The present paper studies low-speed (below 30 km/h) derailment of freight trains, performing experimental full-scale tests, using an instrumented wagon equipped with a commercial derailment detector. Specifically, the dynamics of a freight wagon during wheel-climb derailment and the motion with one axle derailed are investigated. During the tests, accelerations were measured at the bogie and at the carbody. Moreover, the intervention of the derailment detector was monitored to assess possible causes of false tripping or miss-detections. Two loading conditions were analysed: empty and loaded wagon. Main achievements may be summarised as follows: (1) the activation of the derailment detector is always triggered by impacts between the axle-box and the rail; (2) if the wagon is empty, vibrations induced by a derailed axle over the sleepers strongly depend on vehicle speed and they may not trigger the derailment detector in the range 15-25 km/h; (3) derailment detectors must be installed at both ends of each wagon. This information may be used to develop derailment detection algorithms integrated into electric control units with computing capabilities..

A whole system model framework to predict damage in turnouts	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Turnout; switches and crossings; track damage; rail surface damage; track settlement; rail wear; plastic deformation; whole system modelling; multi-body dynamics (MBD); vehicle-track interaction (VTI)	ROLLING-CONTACT FATIGUE; RAILWAY; OPTIMIZATION; DEFORMATION; SIMULATION; WEAR	This paper presents a whole system model framework that enables a holistic prediction of accumulated track damage in railway turnouts. A modular approach allows for insight into the interaction of different damage mechanisms such as rail profile change due to the plastic deformation and wear as well as track settlement. The methodology focuses on the two most critical areas of the turnout in terms of damage: switch and crossing panels. It is shown that at the beginning of the service life of the turnout the running surface of the rails in these areas change significantly due to plastic deformation, which in turn increases the dynamic impact forces from passing vehicles. These impact forces cause vertical track settlement that is most pronounced in the crossing area. Track settlement introduces additional dynamics into the system leading to self-reinforcing behaviour. It is shown that the proposed methodology can predict accumulated track damage accounting for the coupling between different damage modes such as track settlement, rail profiles plastic deformation and wear. It can therefore be used for holistic assessment of turnouts e.g. in design optimisation studies.

Hardware-in-the-loop pantograph tests using analytical catenary models	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Hardware-in-the-loop; analytical catenary model; steady-state response; pantograph	HYBRID SIMULATION; DYNAMICS	Pantograph hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing is an experimental method in which a physical pantograph is excited by an actuator which reproduces the movement of a virtual catenary. This paper proposes a new method that uses analytical catenary models for HIL tests. The approach is based on an iterative scheme until achieving a steady-state regime. Some of the method's advantages include its ability to consider the delay in the control and communication system and its applicability to a wide range of analytical catenary models. The proposed algorithm was validated both numerically and experimentally. The experimental results obtained in the HIL pantograph tests were compared with those obtained from pure numerical simulations using a linear pantograph model and showed good accuracy with pantograph running at different speeds.

Based on the classical vehicle-track coupled dynamics theory, and gear and bearing dynamics theory, this investigation develops a novel vehicle-track coupled dynamics model with an enhanced gear transmission subsystem comprising gear pair and bearing. In the model, the enhanced gear transmission and vehicle-track system are coupled through suspension system, gear mesh interface, nonlinear bearing interaction and wheel-rail relationship, which enables detailed analysis of the gear transmission in the whole coupled system. Following the validation of the proposed model, the dynamic interactions between the gear pair and bearing are comprehensively investigated. Besides, the effects of the traction torque and track irregularities on the gear-bearing system are investigated. Results show that the gear meshing has significant influences on the bearings. The vehicle-track coupled environment has non-negligible effects on the dynamic interactions and vibrations of the gear transmission. Moreover, the proposed model is applicable to the further dynamic analysis of gears and bearings of the motor car under gear cracking, bearing failures, wheel defects and other destabilising conditions.

J	Yuan, XC; Zhu, SY; Zhai, WM				Yuan, Xuancheng; Zhu, Shengyang; Zhai, Wanming			Dynamic performance evaluation of rail fastening system based on a refined vehicle-track coupled dynamics model	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Rail fastening system; dynamics modelling; mode superposition method; vehicle-track coupled dynamics		Damage of rail fastening system often occurs due to severe vehicle-track dynamic interactions. To evaluate the dynamic performance of the rail fastening system subject to dynamic interactions between vehicle and track, a refined vehicle-track coupled dynamics model involving an elaborated model of rail fastening clip (RFC) is developed in this work. Firstly, the RFC model is established based on the mode superposition method by which the difficulty in deducing dynamics equation due to the complex shape of RFC can be easily resolved. Then, the mode shape vectors and natural frequencies of RFC which required by the mode superposition method are obtained through a numerical modal analysis, and verified by a modal test. Finally, through the contact relationship between RFC and rail, the RFC model is implemented into the vehicle-track coupled dynamics model. The reliability of the proposed model is supported by a field test data, and the dynamic performances of rail fastening systems along the track subject to vehicle-track dynamic interactions can be efficiently and effectively evaluated. By applying the proposed model, the influences of rail corrugations, vehicle speeds, and rail pad stiffness on dynamic performances of the rail fastening system are evaluated in detail.

This paper proposes a novel lateral stiffness modelling method. The lateral stiffness and torsional stiffness of an air spring are derived by thermodynamics, hydrodynamics and Newton mechanics, and uncertain parameters are identified by a numerical fitting method. Furthermore, a full-scale laboratory air spring test bench is constructed to verify the accuracy of the proposed model, and the impact of the lateral displacement, internal pressure, and roll angle on the lateral stiffness is discussed through sensitivity analysis. The proposed model is compared with the quadratic function lateral stiffness derived based on the finite element method to verify its advantages. The results show that the proposed lateral stiffness model agrees with experimental data and more precise than the FEM model. Overall, it provides better lateral stiffness characteristics of the air spring system than the FEM model.

Three-dimensional fixed-trajectory approaches to the minimum-lap time of road vehicles	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Minimum-lap time; three-dimensional road; fixed trajectory; g-g-g map; cars; motorcycles; apex-finding	OPTIMIZATION; LINE	Minimum-lap-time simulations with quasi-steady-state models and predefined trajectory have been in use for many years. However, most of the published works deal with two-dimensional roads and employ the so-called apex-finding method. This paper focuses on the application to three-dimensional roads, both with an extension of the 'apex-finding' approach to three-dimensional scenarios and with an optimal control method. Both approaches are based on g-g-g diagrams, i.e. the three-dimensional extension of the well-known g-g maps. In addition, under the assumption that the predefined trajectory is determined from noisy data (e.g. logged from the real vehicle), the three-dimensional trajectory reconstruction problem is addressed, to find a smooth and drift-free racing line to be used in the minimum-time simulation - again an optimal control approach is employed for the trajectory reconstruction. Examples of application are given both for a car and a motorcycle.

J	Vollebregt, E; Six, K; Polach, O				Vollebregt, Edwin; Six, Klaus; Polach, Oldrich			Challenges and progress in the understanding and modelling of the wheel-rail creep forces	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Rail-wheel interaction; creep forces; friction; tribology; vehicle-track interaction	NON-HERTZIAN CONTACT; 3-DIMENSIONAL ROLLING-CONTACT; DRY FRICTION; WET CONDITIONS; KALKER BOOK; ADHESION; WEAR; SIMULATION; FASTSIM; SPEED	This paper surveys advances in the understanding and modelling of wheel-rail creep forces. The main focus is placed on tribological aspects, for which significant progress was made in the past two decades. We emphasise the role played by the surface conditions, i.e. the presence of liquid and solid layers, surface roughness, and near-surface plastic deformation. As these surface conditions may change over time, transient changes may be obtained in the creep force characteristic. This brings feedback into the picture, with consequences and opportunities for optimised adhesion recovery, traction control, and braking systems.

A method to control excessive local vibration with multiple dynamic vibration absorbers (DVAs) is presented. Firstly, possible causes of the high vibration levels are investigated with operational and modal tests. Then a model of the vehicle body with multiple DVAs is established based on the modal superposition method. It is found that a strong peak at the low frequency is dominated by a single mode, which can be attenuated with under-frame equipment as a single DVA. In the frequency region between 30 and 35 Hz several local modes contribute, and are controlled with multiple DVAs. Methods are studied to determine the optimal parameters for these DVAs, including location, natural frequency and mass. For a single DVA conventional fixed-point theory is used, whereas for multiple absorbers an optimization method is proposed. Finally, the effect of the optimization is verified in a full vehicle model with frequency responses analysis. The results indicate that the proposed method can reduce the vibration of targeted modes and improve the ride quality considerably in terms of the vertical motion.

In this paper, the motion conditions of wheelsets under the same bogie are analysed with differential wheelset misalignment based on the mechanical equilibrium condition. A rigid-flexible coupling model of vehicle-turnout dynamic interaction that fully considering different misalignment conditions is established to evaluate the wheel and turnout rails dynamic interaction and vehicle dynamic characteristics. The results show that wheelset misalignment can change wheel load transition position and affect wheel-rail contact conditions, especially when the misalignment direction is toward the switch rail. The larger misalignment angle will increase flange contact range and keep the normal contact stress at a higher level. Both misalignment angle and form determine the wheel-rail vertical force. The lateral force is mainly affected by the superposition effect of the eccentric load and the lateral impact of the wheel load transition.

Comfort improvement in railway vehicles via optimal control of adaptive pneumatic suspensions	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Adaptive suspension; pneumatic; railway vehicle; method of moving asymptotes		This paper presents an adaptive optimal control strategy focused on improving ride comfort by minimising the root mean square of accelerations measured at seven locations on the carbody floor. It requires preview knowledge of both the train speed and the standard track quality (not the deterministic track disturbances) and differs from other works in considering pointwise constraints (upper and lower secondary suspension travel limits). Adaptive control is achieved by varying the diameter of the restriction orifice which connects the pneumatic spring to the auxiliary air reservoir, which confers different dynamic stiffness and damping to the front and rear secondary suspensions. Decision maps with the front and rear optimal diameters for five track irregularity levels and six different speeds were obtained using a Monte Carlo strategy based on solving the optimal control problem for 240 stochastic realisations of time-varying track irregularities of 300 s. Results show that the adaptive optimal control provides a successful compromise between comfort and safety which overshadows the conventional passive approach: it improves comfort up to 50% with respect to stiff passive configurations and it guarantees constraint fulfilment unlike compliant passive configurations.

Whether the emergency braking is initiated by a human driver or by an AEBS, drivers have difficulty adjusting steering correctly to balance yaw moment generated by asymmetric tyre braking force. Some anti-lock braking systems reduce braking force to reduce the yaw moment, which will increase braking distance. To improve the stability in the abovementioned scenario, a feedback-feedforward steering controller is proposed in this paper. To describe the tyre force characteristics of combined slip and nonlinearity, a linear tyre model based on the total differential method is developed. The receding horizon linear quadratic regulator method is utilised to design the feedback steering input to drive state variables to zero in the finite domain. And fuzzy logic is developed to tune the weighting matrix. Furthermore, feedforward steering input is designed to suppress path tracking steady-state error. The performance of the proposed controller is illustrated by hard-braking manoeuvres experiments on normal split-mu and 'checkerboard' roads.

J	Yang, YT; Liu, GX; Wang, XW				Yang, Youtao; Liu, Guoxiang; Wang, Xiaowen			Time-frequency characteristic analysis method for track geometry irregularities based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert spectral analysis	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Track geometry irregularities; track inspection vehicle; time-frequency energy density; multivariate empirical mode decomposition; Hilbert spectral analysis		The description and evaluation of track geometry irregularities are commonly performed in the distance domain or the frequency domain, and therefore one cannot simultaneously obtain precise measurements of actual frequencies and the distance locations where they appear. This paper proposes the time-frequency energy density (TFED) method to analyse the characteristics of track irregularities in the joint spatial distance-frequency plane. The proposed method describes the energy density distribution of track irregularities in the spatial distance-frequency domain based on the adaptive decomposition characteristics of the multivariate empirical mode decomposition and the time-frequency aggregation on the signal energy of the Hilbert spectrum. The mathematical relationships between the TFED and the standard deviation, as well as the power spectral density, are deduced and validated in the field data of track irregularities. The TFED method was applied to the spatial distance-frequency characteristic distribution of track irregularities and the distribution of instantaneous energy density in the sensitive wavelengths. The track geometry quality is evaluated based on the TFED, using track inspection data of actual high-speed railways.

J	Chen, JY; Wang, P; Xu, JM; Chen, R				Chen, Jiayin; Wang, Ping; Xu, Jingmang; Chen, Rong			Simulation of vehicle-turnout coupled dynamics considering the flexibility of wheelsets and turnouts	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Flexibility; wheelset; turnout; modal superposition method; finite element method	ROTATING FLEXIBLE WHEELSET; TRAIN; PREDICTION; VALIDATION; MODEL	The turnout causes significant vibrations of the wheel-rail system. In this study, based on the modal superposition method and finite element method, the flexibility of wheelsets and turnouts is considered respectively, and the vehicle-turnout coupled dynamic model is established. The swept-frequency analysis is adopted to capture the natural frequencies of wheelsets and turnouts. The dynamic interaction and modal resonance performance of the wheel-rail system are investigated when the vehicle passes through the turnout. Results indicate that during the wheel load transition in the crossing, the major frequency bands of the vertical wheel-rail impact force are related to natural frequencies of the crossing. Due to the wheelset resonant modes, the vertical impact force decreases by 12% in the through route and increases by 10% in the diverging route. The wheelset flexibility affects the wheel-rail creepage and decreases the longitudinal wheel-rail force. The wheel-rail impact force has nearly converged as the cut-off frequency of wheelsets reaches 500 Hz.

The model-based method employs unknown input observers on a vehicle-trailer roll/pitch dynamic model with fault thresholds. In the proposed ML approach, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with long-short term memory gates is designed to estimate the road angles. The inputs of the RNN have been selected based on the vehicle-trailer roll and pitch dynamic models, and are normalised by the vehicle wheel-base, mass, and centre of gravity height so that the network is modularly applicable to different trailer types. The simulation and experimental test results justify the performance of the proposed road-bank and grade-angle estimation scheme in various cases and demonstrate that both bank and grade angles can be estimated with high accuracy.

This study focused on this challenge, and conducted an experimental-numerical study of the relationship between the car-body initial dynamic sway and the operational safety during wind speed abrupt changes. The results revealed that the car-body initial dynamic-sway states (i.e., amplitude and speed) before a train passed through sections where the wind speed changed abruptly were the primary causes of this new phenomenon, and the effect of the car-body initial dynamic sway on the train's overturning safety was greater than derailment safety. Furthermore, the probability of an increase in overturning risk was greater than the probability of a decrease in risk when the train negotiated the sections where wind speed changed abruptly with different initial dynamic-sway states of the car-body. As a result, we suggested a probability critical wind speed curve for the train's ability to negotiate abrupt changes in wind speed, which provides a reference for developing a more reasonable train operation scheme in complex conditions.

On the shovelling condition, the torque distribution can be optimised according to the tire load. Then the parasitic power and wheel slippage can be reduced, and the tractive force and efficiency are improved. In this study, the singular value decomposition unscented Kalman filter is adopted to estimate the shovelling load. Based on the estimated shovelling load, the vertical tire force is calculated. The tire load rate is used to build the optimisation objective. The drive antiskid is set as the boundary condition. And a modified particle swarm optimisation is applied as the optimisation algorithm. A wheel loader is utilised for the testing data acquisition. Based on the acquired testing data, the comparative study about the optimisation and un-control strategies is operated. The results show that the slippage occurs less in the optimisation strategy, and the tractive force and efficiency are higher than the un-control strategy. In this study, the feasibility of the shovel load estimator is verified. The advantages of the optimisation strategy of distributed drive electric wheel loaders in shovelling process are analysed.

The so called stiff architecture is oriented to the road behaviour. It enables the use of the levelling system, allowing, amongst others, the body control under driver inputs [Bouvin J-L, Moreau X, Benine-Neto A, et al. CRONE body control under driver inputs through heave velocity regulation, 2017 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC), Belfort, France; 2017]. The second one, called CRONE architecture, isolates the vibrations from irregularities in the road surface. It provides outstanding performances in terms of body control under road inputs, robustness of body control to sprung mass variations and vibration isolation. It also enables to resolve the dilemma between mass and damping coefficient, inherent to classic suspensions.

J	Sebes, M; Bezin, Y				Sebes, M.; Bezin, Y.			Considering the interaction of switch and stock rails in modelling vehicle-track interaction in a switch panel diverging route	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Switch and crossings; railway dynamics; wheel-rail contact; vehicle-track interaction; track models; switch rails; stock rails		Vehicle-track interaction in a switch panel diverging route is studied with a focus on the way its components may interact in the lateral direction. Taking one of the cases of S&C benchmark as the base model, several variants of the co-running track model are considered. In the first series of simulation, the effect of the lateral separation of the switch rail and stock rail is investigated, showing that only small differences are found in terms of wheel/rail forces between a track model where both rails are coupled, and one where they are free to move with respect to one another. Only transient effects are visible at the beginning and at the end of the two-point contact on both rails. While small, these differences can have some influence in terms of rolling contact fatigue and wear prediction. In the second series of simulation, co-running track models are developed including the baseplate and taking into account such effects as switch rail/stock rail contact at the undercut plane and dry friction. Significant changes are observed in the load distribution within the switch panel. Conclusions should be consolidated through experimental field measurement and using more realistic track models, e.g. discretely supported rail beam models.

J	Chen, Y; Wang, J; Chen, JY; Wang, P; Xu, JM; An, BY				Chen, Yu; Wang, Jian; Chen, Jiayin; Wang, Ping; Xu, Jingmang; An, Boyang			A novel three-dimensional wheel-rail contact geometry method in the switch panel considering variable cross-sections and yaw angle	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Railway turnout; wheel-rail contact; 3D asymmetric contact geometry; variable switch rail profiles; yaw angle	HERTZIAN METHOD; MECHANICS; VEHICLES; MODEL	Solving the wheel-turnout contact geometry is complex because the rail section is varying along its longitudinal position. Besides, a large yaw angle will occur, especially when the vehicle passes the switch panel in a diverging route. However, previous researches seldom considered the aforementioned factors simultaneously in performing wheel-rail local contact analysis. This paper therefore proposes a novel three-dimensional (3D) contact geometry method considering the combined effects of varying rail profiles and the yaw angle. This study uses S1002CN wheels and the switch panel of a 1:12 turnout as research objects to study the contact geometry, normal and tangential contact solution. The results indicate that the combined influences of rail profiles varying within the contact patch and the yaw angle on the contact solution are significant. The variable rail profiles obviously affect the position of the contact point. With a yaw angle, the normal gap, contact patch shape and stress distribution calculated by the novel 3D contact geometry method are asymmetric along the lateral and longitudinal directions, especially when the wheel flange contacts with a rail gauge corner. The proposed method can improve the accuracy of the wheel-rail contact solution and help predict rail damage in switch panels.

J	Reina, G; Leanza, A; Mantriota, G				Reina, Giulio; Leanza, Antonio; Mantriota, Giacomo			Model-based observers for vehicle dynamics and tyre force prediction	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Vehicle dynamics estimation; model-based nonlinear observation; tyre force prediction; slip-angle estimation; Kalman filtering; Cubature Kalman filtering; Particle filtering	UNSCENTED KALMAN FILTER; TIRE FORCES; SLIP ANGLE; STATE	Advanced control and driving assistance systems play a major role in modern vehicles, ensuring higher standards of safety and performance. Their correct operation extensively depends on the knowledge of tyre forces and vehicle drift. However, these quantities are hard to measure directly, due to cost or technological reasons. One possible alternative that is attracting much attention in the last few years is represented by virtual sensing where the quantities of interest can be inferred using a physical model that maps the relationship between these quantities and other available direct measurements, like accelerations, velocities and rate-of-turns. In this research, model-based observation is adopted to predict tyre forces and slip angles. In contrast to existing systems, ours relies on direct causality equations without the need of any explicit tyre model. Different observers are developed that are grounded, respectively, in the Cubature Kalman and Particle filtering, and they are contrasted against the standard Extended Kalman filter (EKF). Results are presented to quantitatively assess the performance of the observers using a 14 Degrees Of Freedom (DOFs) full vehicle model that has been simulated in standard manoeuvres including constant radius cornering, increasing and swept-sine steering, and sine-dwell manoeuvring. Although all three embodiments allow model nonlinearities and measurement noise to be appropriately tackled, the two Kalman filters outperform the PF in terms of estimation accuracy, especially for tyre force prediction. In addition, the novel Cubature Kalman filter shows comparable accuracy and robustness, but higher stability when compared to the EKF.

The wheel roughness and structural vibration were both recorded during two re-profiling cycles. The 3rd order polygonal wear was observed in the early stage. The vibration of the axlebox can be aggravated even at lower speed when the passing frequency of polygonal wear approaches the P2 resonance frequency. Subsequently, the 22nd-25th and 14th-15th order developed. The trend analysis suggests that the development of high-order polygonal wear is exponential-like. Moreover, a localised decline is explored during the development progress due to the change of route, which indicates the polygonal wear can be suppressed by reducing the proportion of constant-speed operation. It is also found that the acceleration amplitude of 550-650 Hz shows the most remarkable rise with the mileage, following the 300-400 Hz. However, there is a slight difference of characteristic frequency between the initially dominant peak and the finally developed order.

Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations and multibody dynamic simulations were carried out to reproduce the field test experiments. The results obtained indicated that the side force and yawing moment of the train plays a key role in the safety of the head and the tail of the train when it passes by a windbreak breach. By analysing the flow structures, the reasons behind the different aerodynamic loads on the train head and tail were discussed. Based on the vehicle movement, the maximum derailment coefficient (0.8) of the train head appeared to be at a higher risk of danger as compared to the maximum derailment coefficient (0.2) of the train tail. This is due to the wind loads on the train head which compel the bogies to relatively move with the carbody along the lateral direction one more time than the train tail. Whereas, for the train tail, there is no relative motion between the carbody and bogies on the tail.

J	Garlick, S; Bradley, A				Garlick, S.; Bradley, A.			Real-time optimal trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles and lap time simulation using machine learning	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Autonomous racing vehicle; lap time simulation; optimal racing line; trajectory planning; neural network; machine learning	CAR	Widespread development of driverless vehicles has led to the formation of autonomous racing, where technological development is accelerated by the high speeds and competitive environment of motorsport. A particular challenge for an autonomous vehicle is that of identifying a target trajectory - or, in the case of a competition vehicle, the racing line. Many existing approaches to finding the racing line are either not time-optimal solutions, or are computationally expensive - rendering them unsuitable for real-time application using on-board processing hardware. This study describes a machine learning approach to generating an accurate prediction of the racing line in real-time on desktop processing hardware. The proposed algorithm is a feed-forward neural network, trained using a dataset comprising racing lines for a large number of circuits calculated via traditional optimal control lap time simulation. The network predicts the racing line with a mean absolute error of +/- 0.27 m, and just +/- 0.11 m at corner apex - comparable to human drivers, and autonomous vehicle control subsystems. The approach generates predictions within 33 ms, making it over 9000 times faster than traditional methods of finding the optimal trajectory. Results suggest that for certain applications data-driven approaches to find near-optimal racing lines may be favourable to traditional computational methods.

J	Zhou, YC; Ye, YG; Hecht, M				Zhou, Yichang; Ye, Yunguang; Hecht, Markus			Running safety analysis of a freight train passing through a single crossover during braking	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Crossover; freight train; braking force; wheel-rail coefficient; track layout; wheel wear	DYNAMIC INTERACTION; PLASTIC-DEFORMATION; SIMULATION; FRICTION; SWITCHES	In addition to the discontinuity of the rail profile of a normal turnout, the unique S-shaped curve of a crossover significantly affects the negotiation performance of a train. For heavy-haul freight trains, the in-train forces generated during the braking process may further deteriorate the running safety. Investigating the dynamic behaviour of the train passing through the crossover under braking forces, therefore, can provide a reasonable basis for ensuring train safety. This paper analyses the dynamic response and wheel wear of a three-vehicle train negotiating a single crossover under variable conditions, including variable braking forces, wheel-rail friction coefficient, and crossover layout forms. The results show that the three factors have considerable influences on train safety. If one of the three factors keeps an ideal level, the safe probability of empty wagons can be significantly improved. Considering that there are still some crossovers with tight curves in the existing railway system, avoiding large braking or lubricating the wheel flange in the crossover is still an effective solution to improve the vehicle's performance. In addition, for a new single crossover, a 600-m-radius curve is a good option for balancing permissible train speeds and construction costs of the crossover.

J	Brandt, A; Jacobson, B; Sebben, S				Brandt, Adam; Jacobson, Bengt; Sebben, Simone			High speed driving stability of road vehicles under crosswinds: an aerodynamic and vehicle dynamic parametric sensitivity analysis	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Aerodynamics; vehicle dynamics; driving stability; crosswind; high speed; parametric study; SUV	SIMULATION; LOADS; GUSTS; BUSES	Crosswinds affect vehicle driving stability and their influence increase with driving speed. To improve high speed driving stability, interdisciplinary research using unsteady aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics is necessary. The current demands of faster development times require robust virtual methods for assessing stability performance in early design phases. This paper employs a numerical one-way coupling between the two disciplines and uses a variety of realistic crosswind gust profiles for the aerodynamic simulations to output representative forces and moments on three vehicle dynamic models of different fidelity levels, ranging from a one-track model to a full multi-body dynamic model of a sports utility vehicle. An investigation on required model fidelity was conducted along with a sensitivity study to find key aerodynamic and vehicle dynamic characteristics to minimise the yaw velocity and lateral acceleration response during crosswinds. Transient aerodynamic simulations were used to model crosswind gusts at high speeds. Analysis of the forces and moments showed that rapid changing gusts generate overshoots in the yaw moment, due to the phase delay of the flow between the front and rear of the vehicle. A methodology for modelling this phase delay is proposed. The response of the vehicle was captured equally well by the enhanced model (mid-level fidelity) and the full multi-body dynamic model, while the simplest one-track model failed to emulate the correct vehicle response. The sensitivity study showed the importance of the positioning of the centre of gravity, the aerodynamic coefficient of yaw moment, wheel base, vehicle mass and yaw inertia. In addition, the axles' side force steer gradients and other suspension parameters revealed potential in improving crosswind stability.

J	Hua, YY; Zhu, SY; Shi, X				Hua, Yingyu; Zhu, Songye; Shi, Xiang			High-performance semiactive secondary suspension of high-speed trains using negative stiffness and magnetorheological dampers	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						High-speed train; riding comfort; semiactive control; negative stiffness; magnetorheological damper		With increasing transportation speed, the excessive vibrations of high-speed trains (HSTs) have become a critical issue to be solved. This study presents an innovative semiactive suspension system consisting of a magnetorheological (MR) damper in parallel with a magnetic negative stiffness (NS) element. The proposed semiactive dampers, called MRNS dampers, are integrated into the secondary suspension of an HST to improve riding comfort. The MRNS design can effectively enhance the vibration mitigation performance of semiactive MR dampers and compensate for the performance gap between traditional semiactive MR dampers and active controllers (e.g. linear quadratic regulator (LQR)). The effects of the NS coefficient and control force weight coefficient are presented, and the optimal selections of these parameters are discussed with respect to the control performance and force tracking errors of the MRNS controller. Results indicate that the MRNS damper can satisfactorily emulate LQR force trajectories. Hence, the semiactive MRNS controller can achieve vibration suppression performance comparable to that of an active LQR controller.

J	Veneri, M; Massaro, M				Veneri, M.; Massaro, M.			The effect of Ackermann steering on the performance of race cars	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Ackermann steering; parallel steering; minimum time; race car; optimisation; optimal control; car dynamics		While several papers dealing with the kinematic of mechanisms that approximate the well-known Ackermann steering are available, apparently there are no contributions related to the effect of Ackermann steering on vehicle performance. This work focuses on the effect of Ackermann steering and parallel steering on the performance of a racing car, after a discussion on the different definitions of Ackermann steering ratio available in the literature. Three scenarios are considered: steady turning, slalom and a circuit lap. Nonlinear optimal control techniques are employed to assess the maximum performance.

Ride comfort enhancement for passenger vehicles using the structure-immittance approach	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Inerter; structure-immittance approach; secondary ride comfort; high-frequency dynamic stiffness; tyre load; suspension travel	H-INFINITY CONTROL; MECHANICAL NETWORKS; SUSPENSION; PERFORMANCE; ABSORBERS; INERTERS	This paper presents a novel approach to identify inerter-based suspension struts, which can provide significant performance enhancement for passenger vehicles. The inerter has been used on Formula 1 racing cars, and several beneficial devices incorporating inerters have also been identified for ride comfort enhancement. However, previous investigations either were limited to simple network configurations with moderate performance improvement, or resulted in complicated configurations with a large number of elements which are impractical for real-life applications. In addition, some important practical performance constraints have not been taken into consideration, such as high-frequency dynamic stiffness which influences the NVH performance, and frequency content consideration of the sprung mass acceleration which more directly relates to passenger perception. In this paper, a quarter-car model including top mount is studied, with the performance of a conventional suspension strut presented as baseline. The structure-immittance approach, which can cover all networks with pre-determined numbers of each element type, is adopted for the identification of the optimal suspension configurations. Several configurations with up to a performance improvement are identified with all other practical performance indices to be no worse than the baseline. The suspension devices proposed in previous works are also considered for a sake of comparison, demonstrating significant advantages of the structure-immittance approach. Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis against the sprung and unsprung mass changes is carried out, which represents cargo and tyre weight variations, respectively. Time domain response and other reality checks are then conducted for the out-performing configurations, which reconfirm the ride comfort enhancement and ensure no unexpected behaviour occurs.

The influence of bicycle fork bending on brake control	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Braking; bicycle; ABS; control; multibody systems; signal processing		Bicycle forks are prone to bending, introducing a flexible structure between front wheel and vehicle body. This has substantial influence on brake control, not only by altering the system dynamics but also causing serious estimation problems. These consist in considerable measurement errors in the incremental wheel speed and longitudinal tyre velocity signals, both affecting the wheel slip estimation. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of this problem that represents a profound difference to classical vehicle dynamics. For this purpose, measurements are recorded in test manoeuvres using an extensive set of measurement variables. Based on this data, the complex nonlinear couplings of longitudinal and vertical dynamics are included in a full-vehicle multibody model. The measurement errors as well as compensation methods are evaluated using both simulation and experimental data. In order to examine the influence on closed-loop brake control a linear control-oriented model is derived. Finally numerical full-vehicle simulations show the influence of fork bending on discrete anti-lock brake control systems (ABS), distinguishing the sheer dynamic phenomenon and the related estimation problem.

It is manifested by a low-frequency and high-amplitude swaying of the car body, which continues for a period of time, posing a significant threat to the passengers' ride comfort and even the vehicle operation safety. However, the complexity of swaying makes the alleviation of this hazard by the conventional suspension parameters and available wheel-rail profile optimisation schemes quite problematic. This study analyses the specifics of vibration signal detection and active low-frequency vibration absorption, based on which a comprehensive set of implementable and universal process approaches to detect and control the low-frequency swaying is proposed. First, the intrinsic parameters of various stages of the swaying signal were obtained via the wavelet packet transform. Based on this, two online detection methods based on a single intrinsic parameter and a combination of intrinsic parameters were proposed. Subsequently, an active low-frequency inerter-spring-damper (ISD) type dynamic vibration absorber (DVA) control strategy was adopted to suppress low-frequency swaying. Finally, full-vehicle models with passive suspension and active low-frequency ISD-DVA were established to investigate the effect of online detection and control of low-frequency swaying. The results obtained proved that the proposed method could promptly detect and accurately identify different swaying stages of the railway vehicle, and the active ISD-DVA is instrumental in the low-frequency swaying elimination and overall improvement of the vibration performance of railway vehicle systems.

LM worn wheels of heavy haul wagons are often re-profiled to their original standard form, and this excessive removal of material could reduce the wheel service life. A new LM wheel profile reconstruction method was established by taking into account the geometrical characteristics of the LM wheel profile and applying the Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline theory. The design of LM thin flange re-profiling wheel can be accomplished by using Particle Swarm Optimization method which handles multiple objectives including train operation safety concerns, and minimizing material removal. A new wheel profile with a flange thickness of 32 mm can be designed by the integration of vehicle-track coupling dynamics model, and the results showed that the mean wear work is reduced by 55.97% compared with the original standard profile. Under the optimized wheel profile, the root mean square value of the lateral force and the maximum contact stress is reduced, and the amount of material removed is decreased. The design method can provide support for the LM wheel re-profiling maintenance, by designing the thin flange profiles of a flange thickness of 28 similar to 33 mm.

An LCV, its driver and the road constitute a unique closed-loop dynamic system. Assessing the dynamic stability is difficult due to the complex interactions of driver-tractor-trailers-road. Rearward amplification (RA) is an effective performance measure of the dynamic stability; various methods are applied for evaluating the RA. However, the measures from different methods may differ significantly. What are the root causes for the disparity of evaluation results? This paper tackles the problem by investigating the typical methods for evaluating the measure of two LCVs, i.e. an A-train double and a B-train double. To this end, simulations of the LCVs are conducted using TruckSim software. The study discloses the main causes for the disparity of the measures from different methods, and recommends the effective approaches to the assessment of the RA.

This method can be used to improve the riding stability of trains when rolling across turnouts, and to optimise the equivalent conicity. The measured profile of a straight switch rail, i.e. a 60D40 rail laid in a high-speed turnout switch area, was taken as a sample for optimisation. The existing curve of equivalent conicity was lowered for reverse-reasoning calculation of the optimised profile. The optimised profile of the 60D40 rail was taken as the optimal design for an in-service straight switch rail. The effectiveness of the optimised design was then evaluated based on static wheel-rail contact and vehicle-turnout coupling dynamics. The conclusions show that, for an in-service straight switch rail, profile optimisation can effectively improve the wheel-rail relationship, thus enhancing the riding stability of trains in turnout switch areas.

This concept represents a further elaboration of Secondary Yaw Control but envisages the use of semi-active hydraulic dampers instead of full-active electromechanical dampers, simplifying the design of the system and facilitating the design of a safe and fault tolerant device. Two control algorithms are proposed for the semi-active damper: maximum power point tracking and skyhook with Karnopp approximation. A multi-physics model of the SAYD is introduced and used in co-simulation with a multi-body model of a high-speed vehicle. Using these models, numerical simulations are performed to assess the behaviour of the semi-active damper in terms of improving the running stability of the rail vehicle at very high speed, showing that the use of the SAYD in combination with any of the two control strategies considered allows to improve substantially the stability of the vehicle. The results of experimental investigations performed in the project will be reported in a companion paper.

Its damage detection is therefore an inevitable part in railway maintenance to ensure the system performance. Recently, deep learning techniques are widely applied to structural health monitoring, including damage detection of the rail fastener based on visions. However, the vision-based detection is mainly limited to visible damages. To address this limitation, this work presents a vibration-based detection method by introducing the fully convolutional network (FCN) to identify invisible damages of fasteners. Firstly, three damage categories are defined and five damage degrees are equivalently represented by modifying the stiffness and damping coefficients of target fasteners. Then, a vehicle-track vertically coupled dynamics model with variable vehicle speeds is established to obtain axle box accelerations (ABAs) under excitations of fastener damage and track irregularity. Finally, a fastener damage detection network is designed based on the FCN architecture to predict damage degrees by inputting the ABA, the track irregularity and the vehicle speed simultaneously. The detection performance is estimated and the network robustness to noise is analysed. The results show that the proposed method is capable of achieving accurate, real-time and robust identification of the fastener damage.

J	Cao, Y; Kassa, E; Zhao, WH				Cao, Yang; Kassa, Elias; Zhao, Weihua			Evaluation of alternative turnout layout designs for an improved dynamic performance of a vehicle-turnout system	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Turnout dynamics; turnout layout; dynamic responses; vehicle-turnout interaction; train speed		The turnout is the key equipment for guiding trains to change lines in railway track, which can affect the vehicle running smoothness and limit the train speed drastically. This paper proposes an optimisation method for turnout layout of the diverging route by considering multiple curvatures or curvature changes through the vehicle-turnout dynamics, and the effect of train speed on dynamic response is studied. For the small numbered turnout, increasing the curve radius of a single circular curve type or using a double radii curves type with a larger front radius can effectively reduce the increase in wheel-rail forces and improve train running quality. For the large numbered turnout, the transition curve can be added to the diverging route to form a circular-transition curve or a transition-circular-transition curve type, thereby significantly reducing the dynamic response of the vehicle-turnout system. The wheel-rail dynamic response increases approximately linearly with the train speed in the circular curve of diverging route, but the increase rate decreases significantly with the train speed in the transition curve part, which is more conducive to the increase of the train speed passing through turnouts.

J	Sakhnevych, A				Sakhnevych, Aleksandr			Multiphysical MF-based tyre modelling and parametrisation for vehicle setup and control strategies optimisation	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Multiphysical tyre; tyre data analysis; nonlinear system modelling; multiphysical parametrisation; thermodynamic and wear analysis	TIRE; SIMULATION; VALIDATION; ALGORITHMS; PARAMETERS; SAFETY	Starting from the earliest phases of design of the vehicle and its control systems, the understanding of tyres is of fundamental importance to govern the overall vehicle dynamics. A properly characterised tyre-road interaction model is essential to achieve a reliable vehicle dynamics model on which more design variations can be studied directly in simulation environment optimising both cost and time. The possibility to count on computationally efficient and reliable formulations represents nowadays a great advantage, and the multiphysical Pacejka's Magic Formula (MF-evo) tyre model presented is one of the best trade-off solutions to meet the strict real-time requirements and to reproduce multiphysical variations of the tyre dynamic behaviour towards temperature, pressure and wear effects. A specific methodology has been developed to characterise and to identify the MF-evo parameters with a high grade of accuracy and reliability directly from experimental data. The proposed technique is based on a pre-processing procedure to remove non-physical outliers and to cluster the data, which allows to optimise the multidimensional parameterisation process. To the purpose of validation of the parametrisation routine, data from a motorsport case, exceptionally difficult to reproduce in simulation due particularly significant variations of the tyre dynamics during a single test, have been employed demonstrating the MF-evo model potential and robustness.

J	Sun, Y; Ling, L				Sun, Yu; Ling, Liang			An optimal tangential contact model for wheel-rail non-Hertzian contact analysis and its application in railway vehicle dynamics simulation	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Wheel-rail tangential contact; non-Hertzian contact; railway vehicle dynamics; equivalent ellipse; MKP contact model	NON-ELLIPTIC CONTACT; FASTSIM; FORCES	Relative to the Hertzian theory, the non-Hertzian contact model (NHM) can better reflect the contact characteristic between wheel and rail in railway vehicle dynamics simulation. In this paper, an optimal wheel-rail tangential contact model is determined for vehicle dynamics simulation. First, based on i) the modified Kik-Piotrowski (MKP) contact model, ii) four different ellipse-equivalent methods, and iii) the modified FASTSIM model or modified FaStrip model, eight NHMs are proposed. Then, taking the Kalker's variational method (KVM) as a reference, the computational accuracies of the eight NHMs for calculating the linear creep coefficient and the tangential forces for the typical tangential contact scenarios are compared. NHM II, that is, the model coupled with the MKP model, the ellipse-equivalent method adopted in the Kik-Piotrowski (KP) model, and the modified FaStrip model, shows the best computational accuracy. Finally, the traditional Hertzian & FASTSIM model, the NHM II model, and KVM model are applied to the vehicle-track coupled dynamics simulations, and the dynamics response of a high-speed train running on a slab track is calculated by different contact models. The comparison results show that the NHM II model exhibits better agreement with the KVM compared with the Hertz & FASTSIM model.

One important case is an avoidance manoeuvre that, in previous research, for example, has been approached by different optimisation formulations. An avoidance manoeuvre is typically composed of an evasive phase avoiding an obstacle followed by a recovery phase where the vehicle returns to normal driving. Here, an analysis of the different aspects of the recovery phase is presented, and a subsequent formulation is developed in several steps based on theory and simulation of a double lane-change scenario. Each step leads to an extension of the optimisation criterion. Two key results are a theoretical redundancy analysis of wheel-torque distribution and the subsequent handling of it. The overall contribution is a general treatment of the recovery phase in an optimisation framework, and the method is successfully demonstrated for three different formulations: lane-deviation penalty, minimum time, and squared lateral-error norm.

The wheel/rail dynamic interactions, as well as the interface wear, have been broadly studied by means of Hertzian contact analysis, but the wheel/rail contact is essentially a non-Hertzian contact matter. This paper presents an investigation of wheel/rail dynamic interaction characteristics of a heavy-haul locomotive subjected to traction loads and dry/wet/greasy contact conditions by using a non-Hertzian contact method. For this purpose, a comprehensive dynamics model for heavy-haul train-track coupled system is established. A non-Hertzian normal contact algorithm and the corresponding creep algorithm are employed to solve wheel/rail normal and tangential contact forces, respectively. The locomotive wheel/rail dynamic interactions under different contact conditions and traction efforts are discussed. The simulation results indicate that traction effort and friction conditions have a significant influence on the contact forces, distributions of contact stress, and adhesion-slip region in the wheel/rail contact patch.

On the correction of rail accelerations predicted by numerical track models based on Timoshenko beam theory	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Rail; finite element methods; virtual environment; track models; wheel-rail impact		Rail accelerations can be used on the defect detection and health monitoring of railway vehicle and track components; therefore, mathematical models that predict this response are of interest for reproducing its behaviour in a wide range of situations. The numerical track models based on the Timoshenko beam theory introduce a non-physical response, which is especially noticeable in the rail accelerations. It is due to the lack of dynamic convergence of the Timoshenko finite element (FE). This paper addresses this phenomenon employing an enhanced formulation of the Timoshenko FE that includes internal degrees of freedom (iDoF). The iDoF shape functions are derived from the Timoshenko beam dynamic governing equations. Firstly, the formulation is presented, and its performance is compared with a similar Timoshenko FE formulation. Secondly, the proposal is assessed in the dynamic modelling of railway track structures. The use of iDoF efficiently corrects the non-physical response of rail accelerations by improving the FE dynamic convergence. Subsequently, a filtering criterion for accelerations is proposed, which removes the remaining non-physical response while guaranteeing the conservation of coherent frequency content. Finally, practical cases are simulated for which the proposed methodology is proved to be more efficient and reliable than the standard approach.

Based on the multi-body system dynamics theory, a rigid-flexible vehicle-turnout dynamic coupling modelwas established, and the wheel diameter-varying flat simulation method used to create wheel flat models of different sizes. The most unfavourable phase of flats on the wheels of a vehicle crossing a turnout was studied by scanning and calculating the phase of the flats. The influence of flat size and vehicle speed on a vehicle with flats crossing a turnout was also analyzed. The results show that, compared with a normal wheel crossing a turnout and a wheel flat acting on the interval rail, a wheel flat acting on the wheel load transition of the frog area will excite greater vertical wheel-rail forces and vertical axle box vibration acceleration; in the turnout area, the main frequency band of the vertical vibration acceleration of the axle box is 550-800 Hz, which is rarely affected by the size of flats or the speed of the vehicle. The third-order bending mode of the wheel is excited when the wheel transits from the wing rail to the point rail.

Improving the track friendliness of a four-axle railway vehicle using an inertance-integrated lateral primary suspension	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Inertance-integrated networks; suspension; vibration; railway vehicle	INCORPORATING INERTERS; WHEELSETS; CONFIGURATIONS; STRATEGIES; STABILITY; DEVICE	Improving the track friendliness of a railway vehicle can benefit the railway industry significantly. Rail surface damage in curves can be reduced by using vehicles with a lower Primary Yaw Stiffness (PYS); however, this can reduce high-speed stability and worsen ride comfort. Previous studies have shown that this trade-off between track friendliness and passenger comfort can be successfully combated by using an inerter in the primary suspension; however, these utilise simplified vehicle models, contact models, and track inputs. Considering a realistic four-axle passenger vehicle model, this paper investigates the extent to which the PYS can be reduced with inertance-integrated primary lateral suspensions without increasing root-mean-square (RMS) carbody lateral accelerations. The vehicle model, with these enhanced suspensions, has been created in VAMPIRE, with the dynamics being captured over a range of vehicle velocities and equivalent conicities. Based on systematic optimisations using network-synthesis theory, several beneficial inertance-integrated configurations are identified, and the PYS can be reduced by up to 47% compared to the default vehicle (a potential Network Rail Variable Usage Charge saving of 26%), without increasing RMS carbody lateral accelerations. Further simulations are performed to investigate the vehicle's performance in curve transitions and when subject to one-off peak lateral track irregularities.	[Lewis, T. D.; Li, Y.; Jiang, J.

In this work, an emphasis is therefore put on the highly efficient simulation and numerical analysis of track geometry excitation and its induced system uncertain behaviours. Considering the spatial variability, frequency coherence and constant evolution of track irregularities, the random analysis of track irregularities belongs to a big data analysis scope. By introducing practical tools of power spectral density (PSD), frequency coherence analysis and correlated variable random simulation method, a strategy for obtaining representative and realistic track irregularity PSD samples is proposed. Besides, the modelling method of vehicle-track interactions, where versatile programming tactics to couple the track slab and subgrade elements with incompatible elemental sizes, is introduced. By combining the simulation methods of track irregularities and vehicle-track dynamic interaction, the dynamic performance of vehicle-track systems can be evaluated efficiently, and the full view of system dynamics is revealed with probabilistic characteristics.

Multibody simulation benchmark for dynamic vehicle-track interaction in switches and crossings: results and method statements	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access							ROLLING-CONTACT; HERTZIAN METHOD; RAIL ROLL; MODEL	A Benchmark of railway multibody dynamics software application to switches and crossings (S&C) is presented, comparing all major commercially available software and a few independent codes. Two different representative S&C have been implemented, using the Manchester Benchmark passenger vehicle. The final results show that all software offer a reliable and efficient way to understand the kinematic and dynamics forces between the wheels and the track elements. The highest challenges are found when modelling a combination of multiple rails in simultaneous contact with a wheel (check-stock or switch-stock), large longitudinal variations in rail shape (crossings) and high lateral steering forces (diverging cases in tight radius). In those cases, the codes able to account for the exact relative motion of each wheels with respect to each rails independently are the most apt. The most significant variations between software are found in the contact prediction with an influence on the detailed contact tangential and normal forces. The user variability is found to be very small, with the most time-consuming and error prone being the task of handling the input data for the variable rails definition. All software could benefit from improvements to assist the user and ensure higher reliability and efficiency generally.

The non-uniform wear in lateral and circumferential directions is normally occurred on wheels. The lateral non-uniform wear will lead to the unexpected hollow wear which can cause flange to flange vibration at low-frequency band, and the circumferential non-uniform wear will result in the vertical vibration which is the originate from the polygon phenomenon. These two forms of wear are coupled to each other on wheels and affect the dynamic behaviours of wheel-rail system. In this paper, a wheel-rail contact dynamics model which includes the 3D geometric shape of wheel profile is established and employed to vehicle system dynamics. The results show that the contact mechanical properties of wheel-rail are greatly affected by the 3D wheel profile. The low-frequency vibration of wheelset caused by hollow wear and the high-frequency vibration by polygonised wear are coupled, which increase the vibrational acceleration of wheel-rail system and even made for the main problem of the periodic separation of wheel and rail and aggravate the wear of wheel polygon.

In this study, a three-dimensional locomotive-track coupled dynamics model that uses the wheelset flexibility was developed. The wheelset rigid motion and elastic deformation are calculated based on the multi-body dynamics theory and finite element method, respectively. The effectiveness of this model was validated. The effect of wheelset flexibility on locomotive-track interaction due to rail weld irregularities is analysed by comparing the dynamic responses obtained using the rigid model and the proposed rigid-flexible coupled model. The proposed model is applied to the sensitivity analysis of the wheelset response to the rail weld geometry irregularity. The results show that the dominant frequency of the wheel-rail force or axle-box acceleration is 81 Hz, which is the 1st bending modal frequency of the wheelset. The P2 resonance frequency is easily excited owing to impacts of rail weld irregularities, which may induce the formation of locomotive wheel polygonization. The wheelset acceleration was more sensitive to the wavelength than the depth of the rail weld irregularities. The wavelength characteristics can be significant in vehicle vibration-based condition monitoring of rail weld irregularities.

J	Huang, CH; Zeng, J				Huang, Caihong; Zeng, Jing			Suppression of the flexible carbody resonance due to bogie instability by using a DVA suspended on the bogie frame	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						High-speed trains; flexible carbody; carbody resonance; bogie hunting motions; dynamic vibration absorber	VIBRATION REDUCTION; BENDING VIBRATION; SPEED	A novel method is proposed to suppress the flexible carbody resonance due to bogie instability by hanging a dynamic vibration absorber (DVA) to the bogie frame. The aim is to design the DVA to change the frequency of the bogie hunting motions, which can ensure the bogie does not operate at the resonant frequency of the objective mode of the flexible carbody. Firstly, the resonance phenomenon of the flexible carbody is introduced. The reason is revealed that the unstable frequency of the bogie hunting motions matches the resonance frequency of the carbody diamond mode, which is identified experimentally by modal testing. Then the unstable behaviour of the bogie with a suspended DVA is studied theoretically by building a simple lateral dynamics model of a bogie system. The basic mechanism of the effect of a DVA on the hunting frequency jump characteristic is explored. It is then adopted to suppress the carbody resonance due to bogie instability in the rigid-flexible multi-body dynamics model of a high-speed railway vehicle. The optimum parameters of the DVA suspension are determined numerically by deigning the unstable frequencies away from the objective natural frequency of the flexible carbody, and its effect on resonance suppression is confirmed.

Vehicle drifting dynamics: discovery of new equilibria	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Vehicle drifting; phase portraits; equilibria; vehicle stability; vehicle sliding dynamics		This study deals with drifting as one of the most important nonlinearities in vehicle dynamics. A four-wheel vehicle model is used to calculate the equilibria in planar motion, numerically, by introducing an assumption on constant longitudinal tyre slips. Other than the unstable drifting points that were reported by previous researchers, a new pair of drifting equilibria are identified and the difference between the two types is studied. The phase portrait approach is used to identify the type of these equilibria, and they reveal the type of instability in the primary and the secondary drifting points, and provide control suggestions to stabilise the drifting equilibria. It is observed that the rear-wheel-drive vehicles have primary drifting equilibria, while the four-wheel-drive vehicles have secondary drifting equilibria. There is a transition point between the primary and the secondary drifting types when the front longitudinal tyre slips increase from zero to saturation. It is further shown that primary drifting becomes stable by regulating the yaw rate at the equilibrium value; whereas the secondary drifting may be stabilised through a constant forward velocity. The stabilisation methods are applied through control designs and validated in simulations.

J	Wu, Y; Li, BY; Du, HP; Zhang, N; Zhang, BJ				Wu, Yang; Li, Boyuan; Du, Haiping; Zhang, Nong; Zhang, Bangji			Fault-tolerant prescribed performance control of active suspension based on approximation-free method	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Active suspension; fault-tolerant control; ride comfort; uncertain dynamics; nonlinear control	FUZZY CONTROL; SYSTEMS	This paper proposes a fault-tolerant controller for active suspension to improve the bounce and pitch performance of a half-car system. In order to guarantee both the transient and steady-state control objectives, the prescribed performance control (PPC) method is applied to regulate the convergence rate, overshoot and tracking error of the closed-loop (CL) system. The system parametric uncertainties including sprung mass, sprung pitch inertia, suspension stiffness and damping coefficient, and axle distances are considered. The dynamics of three types of frequently encountered actuator faults are elaborated. Unlike most of the existing studies that use the adaptive method or neural network (NN) to estimate the uncertain parameters, this paper proposes a novel approximation-free method to deal with the uncertainties. The stability of the CL system is rigorously proved, and the suspension performance is examined with respect to physical constraints. In the numerical simulation, two kinds of imperfect actuators with hybrid nonlinear characteristic are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Simulation results show that the proposed controller can effectively suppress the bounce and pitch motions for the sprung mass and is robust to system uncertainties and actuator faults.

To improve the comfortability and drivability during mode switching from hydraulic driving mode to engine driving mode, this paper proposes a coordinated control strategy for the engine, clutch and HPM. To capture the transient behaviour of the powertrain, a medium-duty PHHV dynamic model is established. Based on a typical PHHV powertrain layout, the mode switching process is analysed and divided into five phases. Control strategies are designed for each phase, respectively.LQR-based closed-loop control strategy is adopted to analyse the effect of clutch engaging speed on vehicle jerk, clutch frictional work and energy consumption. HPM output torque is adjusted to compensate the engine clutch drag torque, with the aim maintaining good drivability. To do this, constant vehicle acceleration is selected as the indicator of stable output torque. The simulation results demonstrate that by using the HPM to compensate the engine clutch drag torque, vehicle drivability is guaranteed during mode switching. From the comparison between different LQR weighting matrices, multiple options are available to drivers on drivability and comfortability during mode switching.

J	Sun, JF; Chi, MR; Jin, XS; Liang, SL; Wang, J; Li, W				Sun, Jianfeng; Chi, Maoru; Jin, Xuesong; Liang, Shulin; Wang, Jian; Li, Wei			Experimental and numerical study on carbody hunting of electric locomotive induced by low wheel?rail contact conicity	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Electric locomotive; carbody hunting instability; ride comfort; parameters optimisation; wheel?rail contact conicity	STABILITY ASSESSMENT; HUMAN-BODY; RAILWAY; VEHICLES; DYNAMICS; HISTORY	In particular locations of the railway track, the excessively polished rail in the inner corner and the large rail cant will lead to an extremely low wheel?rail contact conicity. Consequently, the carbody hunting instability arises and deteriorates the ride comfort of passengers. In this paper, the carbody hunting instability of an electric locomotive is observed and tested. Combined with the analysis of wheel?rail contact and track condition, the ride comfort and running stability indices are evaluated. The dynamic model for the locomotive is established. The measured wheel and rail profiles as well as the curve radius and superelevation are integrated into the simulation model to reproduce the phenomenon that the carbody hunting displayed violent in the straight line while the abnormal vibration disappeared in the curve segment. The linearised and non-linear study on the optimisation of suspension parameters are carried out to solve the carbody hunting instability. Finally, the optimised measures that decreasing the series stiffness and damping of the yaw damper as well as the primary longitudinal stiffness are put forward, and verified by the on-track test. The investigation enriches the study of carbody hunting instability and gives some ideas to probably solve the abnormal vibration.

A comparison of free trajectory quasi-steady-state and transient vehicle models in minimum time manoeuvres	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Minimum lap-time; free-trajectory; QSS; transient; comparison; time optimal control	RACE CAR; OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATION	Lap-time optimisation programs utilising Quasi-Steady-State (QSS) vehicle models are computationally efficient, though inherent simplifications produce inaccuracies. An analysis of the prediction capabilities of a new QSS lap-time optimisation method is presented. A transient vehicle model is formulated with seven degrees-of-freedom (DOF) dynamics. The QSS vehicle model utilises point-mass dynamics, where accelerations are constrained by a bi-quintic piece-wise spline surface produced with an identical transient vehicle model. Notable changes to the development of the new QSS model include, evaluation of the acceleration envelope in natural coordinate frame, and the implementation of a normal jerk limit which acts to artificially mimic the yaw inertia resistance during change of direction manoeuvres. Results of the minimum time solution are shown for 90 degrees left-hand turn, double lane change and full circuit analysis based on Adria International Raceway. An accuracy improvement against previous QSS models is presented.

The industrial objective of this work is thus to develop a method to reduce the energy consumed by a train over a journey by playing on the driver commands (traction and braking forces) while respecting punctuality constraints. First, a rigid body approach (Lagrangian formalism) is introduced to characterise the dynamics of the train. In particular, the aerodynamic (including the wind effect), traction, and braking forces are taken into account, and a special attention is paid to the vertical and lateral characteristics of the track as they play a key role in the train dynamics. Second, a model for energy consumption and recovery (thanks to dynamic braking) is introduced. Experimental measurements of a high-speed line are then used to estimate the parameters on which the two previous models are based and to validate their predictive capacities. The optimisation problem under constraints is finally solved using an evolutionary algorithm where the constraints are implemented using an augmented Lagrangian formalism. The performance of the proposed method in terms of speed optimisation and energy consumption reduction is compared to measurements associated with commercial trains.

Motors are capable of providing controls with response and accuracy two orders of magnitude greater than internal combustion engines. It is also relatively simple to design a driveline capable of independently controlling the driving force at each wheel by providing compact motors throughout the vehicle. Although the potential of such driving force distribution control in improving vehicle dynamic performance has been a serious topic of research since even before the current wave of driveline electrification, the complex mechanisms required to realise these controls have prevented mass adoption. However, it seems that these research efforts are finally reaching a stage where practical adoption might be possible. This state-of-the-art review examines the background and most recent research related to vehicle dynamics control, particularly controls that use electrical drive units, and investigates the topics of interest and trends of a wide range of researchers. Subsequently, taking into account ongoing efforts to pair vehicle dynamics controls with electrical actuators, this review also discusses a novel control architecture that depart from control design methods formulated in the past by researchers across the field, and points the way toward the future of vehicle dynamics control research.

Identification of a driver model incorporating sensory dynamics, with nonlinear vehicle dynamics and transient disturbances	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Driver; vehicle; steering; control; perception; model; identification; vestibular; simulator; simulation	CAR	In earlier work, a driver model incorporating sensory dynamics was identified from driving simulator experiments involving random disturbances, random target paths and linear vehicle dynamics. In the present paper, the driver model and experiments are extended to include transient disturbances, discrete target paths and nonlinear vehicle dynamics. The predictions of the model are compared with measurements from the experiments. Simulator motion is found to have a significant beneficial effect on drivers' responses, giving faster driver reaction times and more successful disturbance rejection and path following. The driver model predicts the measured responses well. The model suggests that drivers are unable to develop an accurate internal model of motion cueing filters, perceiving phase and gain distortions introduced by filtering as disturbances. Drivers are found able to account for the time-varying operating point of a nonlinear vehicle. The driver model is also able to match the behaviour of experienced drivers near the friction limit of the tyres, however, further work is necessary to understand how an inaccurate internal model impedes the performance of less experienced drivers.

Experimental investigation of the leading parameters influencing the hydroplaning phenomenon	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Aquaplaning; vehicle-track interaction; vehicle safety; contact mechanics		Tire hydroplaning is a phenomenon that occurs when the tire is no longer able to evacuate water from the road due to excessive speed. A water layer will then be interposed between the tire and the road, reducing their contact surface and decreasing the tire''s ability to transmit forces. The purpose of this work is to analyse this loss of contact surface through the experimental point of view with real scale tests, which are perfectly suitable to understand the mechanisms. These tests consist in observing and then measuring the contact area of the tire with the ground in hydroplaning conditions through a measurement window. An investigation of the main factors engaged in hydroplaning situation is performed and the key parameters involved are identified. For a given tire, these surface losses are measured as a function of speed under different experimental conditions (inflation pressure, water level, tire wear, etc.). These results are then partially extended to the study of three other tires.

J	Wei, K; Zhao, ZM; Ren, JJ; Ou, LC; Wang, P				Wei, Kai; Zhao, Zeming; Ren, Juanjuan; Ou, Lingchang; Wang, Ping			High-speed vehicle-slab track coupled vibration analysis of the viscoelastic-plastic dynamic properties of rail pads under different preloads and temperatures	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						High-speed vehicle&#8211; track coupled vibrations; viscoelastic-plastic dynamic property of rail pad; preload-dependence of rail pad; temperature-dependence of rail pad		The viscoelastic-plastic dynamic properties of rail pads were are not adequately accounted for in the traditional vehicle-track coupled dynamic model. To investigate the influence of the viscoelastic-plastic dynamic properties of rail pads on the high-speed vehicle-track coupled vibrations, we obtained the viscoelastic-plastic dynamic properties of rail pads first by a series of laboratory tests, after which we described these properties theoretically by a modified Fractional Derivative Zener (FDZ) model and a traditional Berg friction model. A modified vertical vehicle-slab track coupled dynamic model was established by introduction of the modified FDZ and traditional Berg models for rail pads to investigate the influence of the viscoelastic-plastic dynamic properties of the rail pads on the high-speed vehicle-slab track coupled vibration responses under various preloads and temperatures. The FDZ and Berg models for rail pads improved the calculation accuracy of the high-speed vehicle-slab track coupled vibration responses, compared with the traditional KV model for rail pads, especially in the dominant high frequency range. The dynamic plastic properties of the rail pads effectively suppressed the high-frequency wheel-rail forces and yet increased the high-frequency vibration responses of the track substructures under the rail. Low temperatures and increased preloads on rail pads had a similar effect on the vehicle-track coupled vibrations. Increasing the preload on rail pads or decreasing the temperature increased the wheel-rail random excitation energy and its dominant frequencies, increased the vibration responses of the wheel-set and the track substructure under the rail, and decreased the vibrations of the rail at nearly all frequencies.

Schalk			Vehicle suspension force and road profile prediction on undulating roads	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Suspension force prediction; road profile estimation; undulating roads; nonlinear suspension; suspension control	DYNAMICS; PARAMETERIZATION; VALIDATION; STATE; FTIRE	Controllable suspension systems have the capability of changing suspension forces. One control approach is to define a cost function with the aim of optimising either ride comfort or handling. Such controllers are usually reactive and not pro-active. Controllers can benefit significantly by havinga prioriknowledge of the effect that changing the suspension settings will have on the suspension forces. This is especially true for vehicles traversing very rough terrain. This paper addresses thea prioriknowledge needed by predicting what the suspension forces will be before changing the suspension setting. The proposed approach involves estimating sprung and unsprung mass acceleration, estimating the road excitation, and then predicting the suspension forces. A quarter car model is used to illustrate the concept. Thereafter, the concept is extended to a nonlinear multibody dynamics model and finally validated experimentally. Results indicate that the suspension force in a different suspension modes can be predicted before switching suspension modes.	[Hamersma, Herman A.; Els, P.

Study of variability in dynamic simulations of turnouts using the PGD method	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Review; Early Access						Switch & crossing; railway dynamics; wheel; rail contact; model order reduction; proper generalised decomposition; data-driven technique; Monte Carlo	RAILWAY; VALIDATION; CONTEXT; TRAIN	The design and maintenance of turnouts implies considering a great number of external factors that have an effect on their structural integrity. The proper generalised decomposition (PGD) method is used in this paper to carry out a parametrised study of the vehicle-track interaction in a non-intrusive way. The reduced model is built using a defined domain for some of the influence parameters: the vehicle speed, the wheel/rail friction coefficient and the axle load. A major assumption of the PGD solution is its ability to express quantities of interest in a separated form. One of the goals is to show the relevance of separability in the field of railway dynamics. The example of a switch is chosen as a validation of method. The output of the PGD model is the dissipated energy per metre in the switch rail. The robustness of the reduced model is verified using the complete solution. Probabilistic simulations are carried out in order to explore the possibility of using the PGD solution as a numerical abacus in dynamic simulations of switches and crossings. These first tests show that the PGD solution is a promising reduction model method in railway dynamics.

J	Lockel, S; Kretschi, A; van Vliet, P; Peters, J				Loeckel, Stefan; Kretschi, Andre; van Vliet, Peter; Peters, Jan			Identification and modelling of race driving styles	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Driver behaviour; driving simulator; driver-vehicle systems; virtual environment; system identification	BEHAVIOR	A good understanding and modelling of the human driver is essential for modern vehicle development, particularly in motorsports, where the race car should fit its driver perfectly. At the same time, an objective assessment and especially imitation of professional race drivers is difficult due to individual driving styles, complex and non-deterministic decision making processes, and small stability margins. In this paper, we present a holistic approach to identify and model individual race driving styles in a robust way. We develop the Driver Identification and Metric Ranking Algorithm (DIMRA) as a data-based method for an in-depth objective analysis and assessment of professional race drivers. Supported by this knowledge, we extend and adapt the imitation learning framework Probabilistic Modeling of Driver Behavior (ProMoD) in order to model race drivers in a complex simulation environment. An evaluation with data from professional race drivers shows the capability of DIMRA to derive metrics which describe human race driving styles, as well as ProMoD to robustly generate competitive laps with human-like controls in a professional motorsport driving simulator. The ability to identify and imitate individual driving styles does not only support the performance optimisation of race cars but could also aid the development of road cars and driver assistance systems in future work.

J	Li, FS; Wu, H; Liu, CT; Wu, PB; Zeng, J				Li, Fansong; Wu, Hao; Liu, Chaotao; Wu, Pingbo; Zeng, Jing			Vibration fatigue analysis of high-speed railway vehicle carbody under shaking condition	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Vibration fatigue; carbody shaking; critical frequency; strength evaluation		A method called modified modal superposition method (MMSM) for calculating the vibration fatigue dynamic stress of carbody under shaking condition is proposed. In MMSM, each external load is divided into low frequency component and high frequency component according to critical frequency (CF), which is used to separate whether the external load causes resonance effect of the structure, then traditional quasi-static method (QSM) and modal superposition method (MSM) are adopted to deal with the two load components respectively. During the simulation, QSM is used to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the structural stiffness under quasi-static condition, while MSM can consider the dynamic characteristics of the structure in resonance state. At last, the fatigue strength of the carbody was carried out based on the stress calculated according to cumulative damage method. The calculation results show that the fatigue life of carbody under shaking condition is significantly reduced to 81,450 km, far less than the design life. The damage of the stress obtained by MMSM is far greater than that from traditional QSM, even in the new wheel condition, the damage obtained by QSM is too dangerous. For the stress obtained by MSM, generally in the low-frequency region, the stress level is higher than that obtained by QSM due to mode truncation, especially for the average stress. So QSM and MSM are not recommended to evaluate the fatigue strength of railway vehicle carbody.

With a certain vibration environment above the limit, structural cracks or component drops occur because of the vibration of axle box and bogie frame. Considering the multi-channel and non-normal characteristics of the measured environment of rail vehicles, a statistical induction method is combined with Johnson system, and a universal technique of vibration environment spectral induction is proposed. By the measured acceleration data from a test vehicle with the problem of the component (transponder) drops from bogie frame, the induced spectrum is calculated, and its comparison with the functional test spectrum from the international standard IEC 61373 reveals that the vibration environment of bogie frame exceeds the limit. Based on the induced spectrum, the hierarchical transmissibility of the primary and secondary suspensions of the test vehicle is derived. It is found that the over-limit vibration environment of bogie frame derives from the high hierarchical transmissibility of the primary suspension. The results show that the proposed technique of spectral induction and hierarchical transmissibility can accurately reflect the measured vibration environment and the layer-by-layer transmission of rail vehicles.

J	Romano, L; Bruzelius, F; Jacobson, B				Romano, Luigi; Bruzelius, Fredrik; Jacobson, Bengt			Unsteady-state brush theory	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Tyre dynamics; tyre model; brush model; transport equation; nonlinear dynamics	CONTACT; MODEL; WHEEL	This paper deals with unsteady-state brush tyre models. Starting from tyre-road contact theory, we provide a full analytical solution to the partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the bristle deformation in the adhesion region of the contact patch. We show that the latter can be divided in two different regions, corresponding to two different domains for the solution of the governing PDEs of the system. In the case of constant sliding speed inputs, the steady-state solution coincides with the one provided by the classic steady-state brush theory. For a rectangular contact patch and parabolic pressure distribution, the time trend of the shear stresses is investigated. For the pure interactions (longitudinal, lateral and camber), some important conclusions are drawn about the relaxation length. Finally, an approach to derive simplified formulae for the tangential forces arising in the contact patch is introduced; the tyre formulae obtained by using the proposed approach are not based on the common slip definition, and can be employed when the rolling speed approaches zero. The outlined procedure is applied to the cases of linear tyre forces and parabolic pressure distribution.

In this study, an integrated active steering device was developed to integrate wheelset constraints and actuators. In addition, to study the minimum wear number control strategy, the existence of an optimal steering level that minimises the wear number was corroborated by a theoretical derivation based on the single wheelset model. Later, this research method was extended to the complete vehicle lateral dynamics model and steady-state solutions at different active steering levels were analysed. The results demonstrate that at optimal steering control, wear number is the lowest. This state is less affected by the running velocity, stiffness of the primary suspension, tread taper, and creep state, which are determined by the wheelbase and track curvature. The lateral forces of rail-vehicle wheels with an active steering function at different steering levels were measured using instrumented wheelsets. Furthermore, the accuracy of the simulation model was verified by comparing the experimental data with simulation results. Finally, the wear number of test vehicles at different steering levels were predicted using this model, and the control strategy proposed in this investigation was validated.

For this purpose, the minimum lap time problem is described as an optimal control problem, converted to a nonlinear programme using direct orthogonal Gauss-Legendre collocation and then solved by the interior-point method IPOPT. Reduced computing times are achieved using a curvilinear abscissa approach for track description, algorithmic differentiation using the software framework CasADi, and a smoothing of the track input data by approximate spline regression. The vehicle's behaviour is approximated as a single track and double track model with quasi-steady state tyre load simplification and nonlinear tyre model. The results are used to evaluate which vehicle physics are important for the calculation of the time-optimal trajectory. The novelty of this work is the consideration of wheel-specific tyre-road friction coefficients along the racetrack using a track friction map. It is shown that variable friction coefficients have a significant impact on the trajectory, and therefore significantly improve lap times on inhomogenous racetracks. The proposed trajectory planning has proven its practical suitability in first tests on an autonomous race car and will be used in the coming racing season in the Roborace competition.

J	Yin, XX; Wei, XK; Xiao, H; Shi, J				Yin, Xianxian; Wei, Xiukun; Xiao, Hong; Shi, Jin			The impact of wheel polygonisation to the railway corrugation	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Wheel polygonal wear; rail corrugation; track dynamics; railway track	MODEL	The railway companies have been beset by rail corrugation for many years, especially those subway companies. Therefore, the formation mechanism of rail corrugation has been paid much attention in the last decades. It is believed that corrugation occurs when the vehicle runs over the track and excites its resonant vibration. Wheel polygonal wear (WPW), as a typical wheel tread defect, inevitably worsens the wheel-rail contact state and excites track vibration. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of the WPW to rail corrugation. In this paper, the impact of WPW to rail corrugation is considered. Firstly, the wheel-rail interaction with WPW is analysed, where the wheel-rail interactive force is treated as a moving harmonic load. Then, the impact of WPW to rail corrugation is investigated with the help of theoretical analysis and simulation experiments. The specific track with integrated ballast bed is considered as an example. The results show that the initial rail wear is largely due to WPW. And when the track resonance is excited by the moving harmonic excitation induced by WPW, the initial wear evolves into rail corrugation.

J	Trimpe, F; Salander, C				Trimpe, Fritz; Salander, Corinna			Wheel-rail adhesion during torsional vibration of driven railway wheelsets	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Torsional vibration; railway drive train; wheel-rail contact; railway vehicle dynamics; railway axle verification		Stability verification of railway wheelsets in Germany can currently become a process difficult to plan. Besides standardised calculations, expensive and often time-consuming test ride measurements have to be conducted. In particular, determining the maximum dynamic torsional stresses resulting from torsional vibration of wheelsets is a frequently discussed topic. Neither an analytical nor an empirical model has been found yet to predict the named stresses. Actually, they are determined experimentally and the representativeness of the recorded maximum dynamic torque is assured statistically. However, statistical evaluation only deals with axle stresses (torque and bending) itself. The origin of torsional vibration, which is the wheel-rail contact point, is not considered for evaluation. Its conditions are typically described by wheel-rail adhesion characteristics, but normally the necessary quantities describing these characteristics are not measured or not measured in sufficient precision. Therefore, this article analyses high-resolution wheel-rail adhesion data that have been recorded additionally on regular test ride measurements. The analysis of these measurement data leads to the following two correlations: (1) Torsional vibration events occur at a certain ratio of adhesion change and slippage change. (2) Dynamic torque swings up within a characteristic time span.

In general this flexibility is not provided by commercial software packages. This paper presents a three-dimensional and nonlinear hand-made model for heavy commercial vehicles including tractor and trailer as well as tractor and semitrailer combinations that can be used in different simulation environments, as well as in real-time applications. As typical for trucks, the torsional flexibility of the frame and a suspended driver's cabin are taken into account. The design kinematics makes it possible to handle different and quite complex axle suspensions very efficiently. Appropriate force elements are used to model various couplings between tractor and trailer or tractor and semitrailer, respectively. The virtual test truck environment (VTT) coded in ANSI C is extremely portable and can easily be embedded in commercial simulation packages like MATLAB/Simulink. It includes the TMeasy tyre model and offers flexible interfaces to third-party software tools.

Vehicle dynamics have strong implications for track longitudinal dynamics, but railway track longitudinal force models are rarely published. This paper developed a three-dimensional railway track model which considers four structure layers: rails, sleepers, ballast and subballast. The rails are modelled using the Finite Element Method and each node has six Degrees of Freedom (DoFs). Sleepers are modelled as rigid bodies and each also has six DoFs. Ballast and subballast are modelled as blocks and each has three translational DoFs. Frictional behaviour is considered in the longitudinal direction of the fastening models as well as in the longitudinal and lateral directions of the sleeper-ballast force connections. Validations of the model are presented in this paper. Simulations of longitudinal forces are also presented. The results show that the model has the capability of simulating track longitudinal forces and the rail creep phenomenon.

It is a multi-body dynamic model with space-dependent track parameters. The method is demonstrated by applying a UIC60-760-1:15 turnout (with curve radius 760 m and turnout angle 1:15). Equivalent track properties are introduced, based on the turnout track flexibility, and the rail receptance and impact force results are compared with the results from a finite element (FE) model. The validation results show a good agreement with those of the FE model, but with far less computational expense in terms of power and time. The new model is found to capture the dominant dynamic behaviour of the turnout across all frequencies up to 2000 Hz. The results have drawn that consideration of higher frequencies is important due to the nature of dynamic forces affecting the crossing region and high-speed cases.

J	Kulkarni, R; Qazizadeh, A; Berg, M; Dirks, B; Persson, I				Kulkarni, Rohan; Qazizadeh, Alireza; Berg, Mats; Dirks, Babette; Persson, Ingemar			Investigating the effect of the equivalent conicity function's nonlinearity on the dynamic behaviour of a rail vehicle under typical service conditions	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Vehicle-track interaction; vehicle running instability; wheel-rail contact; equivalent conicity (EC); nonlinear parameter (NP); wheel and rail profile maintenance	PARAMETERS	Generally, the equivalent conicity function (ECF) is denoted by equivalent conicity at 3mm (lambda(3mm)) and a Nonlinearity Parameter (NP). NP describes the nonlinearity of the ECF and its influence on a vehicle design is explored thoroughly, however, NP's role in vehicle and track maintenance is not researched yet. This paper investigates the influence of track maintenance actions on vehicle dynamics with help of NP vs lambda(3mm) scatter plots of ECF database. The ECF database is constructed by combining measured worn wheel and rail profile pairs of the Swedish high-speed vehicle and rail network, respectively. The ECF database revealed an inverse relationship between lambda(3mm) and NP, i.e., NP is negative for larger lambda(3mm) values. The combination of negative NP and high lambda(3mm) causes reduction in the vehicle's nonlinear critical speed and vehicle often exhibit the unstable running on the Swedish rail network. Thus, the occurrence of ECF with negative NP and high lambda(3mm) is undersirable and the undesirable ECF can be converted into desirable ECF by grinding the rail, which converts ECF's into positive NP and low lambda(3mm) combinations. Thus, the NP parameter along with the lambda(3mm) must be considered in track maintenance decisions.

This implies the need for developing mathematical models of pantographs and catenaries and determining their parameters. The article presents a method to determine parameters of mechanical joints of a railway pantograph based on analysis of pantograph subassemblies in swinging motion. The experimental tests consisted in disassembling the pantograph and creating partial subassemblies which were then analysed with respect to their damped linear or angular oscillations. The simulation analysis required developing, in CAD, 3D models of individual pantograph parts and their subassemblies. Defined were joints between particular elements, which represent of real pantograph structure. The inertia parameters of the model were determined, based on structural characteristics and physical properties of materials, used for manufacturing individual pantograph elements, and then verified experimentally. The dissipative parameters of the mechanical joints were calculated iteratively. The model of complete pantograph assembly was also subject to verification and in this case, good convergence between simulation and experiment results was achieved. The obtained parameter values can be used in simulation models of other railway pantographs having a similar structure.

J	Cui, QJ; Ding, RJ; Wei, CF; Zhou, B				Cui, Qingjia; Ding, Rongjun; Wei, Chongfeng; Zhou, Bing			Path-tracking and lateral stabilisation for autonomous vehicles by using the steering angle envelope	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Autonomous vehicles; path-tracking; vehicle stabilisation; model predictive control; computational cost; steering angle envelope	MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; CONTROLLER	In the design of a path-tracking controller for autonomous vehicles, mediating the conflicting objectives among path-tracking, vehicle stabilisation, and low computational cost is a challenging issue. Accordingly, this paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC)-based path-following controller with steering angle envelopes. In contrast to previous MPC-based structure, in which the constraints in terms of the road sides and lateral stabilisation directly impose on the algorithm, in the proposed approach, these aspects are formulated as the steering angle envelopes. This feature enables the controller to simultaneously ensure the tracking performance and computational feasibility. Moreover, considering the trade-off between path-tracking and vehicle stabilisation, the full-length prediction horizon pertaining to the steering angle envelopes are divided into two different parts: the safe road envelope is applied in the short-term, and the stable handling envelope is applied in other part. By modelling vehicles driving under different road conditions with various driving speeds and road adhesion values, the developed controller is compared with several existing control schemes via simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments. The comparison results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in realising path-tracking, lateral stabilisation, and real-time computational capabilities in the best possible manner.

The FE (finite element) model of the bridge is built in Ansys and coupled with the multibody dynamic model of the vehicle in the UM (Universal Machine). software. FIALA formula is used to construct the tire model. Then, the vehicle-bridge coupling system of the new type suspended monorail is set up and simulated with Park method. The result of the modal analysis and vehicle-bridge coupling simulation draw the same conclusion that the span of the stiffeners could result in the resonance of the vehicle system, which is due to the coupling of the frequencies of the natural modes of the car body and bogie with that for vehicle passing through stiffeners. Through the multibody dynamic simulation of the vehicle-bridge coupling system, the modes of the bridge at the frequencies of 5-10, 15-25 and 30-40 Hz are easily excited when the vehicle passes through the bridge. The three constraint modes and free modes of the bridge are similar in these frequency ranges.

MPC trajectory planner for autonomous driving solved by genetic algorithm technique	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						MPC; GA methods; motion planning; autonomous driving; obstacle avoidance		Focusing on autonomous driving algorithm development, this paper proposes a novel real-time trajectory planner formulated as a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) algorithm. The mathematical formulation of the problem is deeply reported and discussed. The numerical solution of the NMPC problem is the result of a novel genetic algorithm strategy that represents the innovative aspect of the work proposed. The aim of this paper is also to show how genetic algorithm can be a valid approach for motion planning strategies. Numerical results are discussed through simulations that show a reasonable behaviour of the proposed strategy in the presence of moving obstacles as well as in a wide range of road friction conditions. Moreover, a real-time implementation for research purposes is assumed as possible by considering computational time analysis reported.

The vehicle uses a three-degree-of-freedom vehicle model, and a uni?ed tire-sideslip-angle model suitable for large tire-sideslip-angle and wheel reverse rotation conditions. Two calculation methods of total dissipation of energy are proposed: the integral calculation method and the energy difference calculation method. This paper analyses the system stability of the vehicle model, using the total dissipation of the energy indicator and compares the results with the Lyapunov exponent indicator. It shows that the dissipation of the energy analysis approach has a fast calculation speed, strong interpretability and high calculation accuracy, which can intuitively and quantitatively reveal the global stability characteristics of vehicle plane motion.

Effects of geometric track irregularities on vehicle dynamic behaviour when running through a turnout	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Turnout; switch; crossing; track irregularities; track flexibility; running safety	SIMULATION; STIFFNESS; TRAIN; RAIL; OPTIMIZATION; SPEED	Railway vehicle dynamics is strongly affected by track irregularities, which can influence the safety and the running behaviour of the vehicle. The EN 13848-5:2017 standard provides the limits of track irregularities for standard track but does not states specific restrictions for switches and crossings. Furthermore, since turnouts have a limited length, their track geometric irregularities cannot be accurately described by stochastic functions usually adopted for railway vehicle dynamics simulations. Nevertheless, irregularities in railway turnouts, related to the non-uniform stiffness of the track support and to the variation of the rail profiles along the longitudinal direction should be considered in dynamic simulations, as they can generate large dynamic loads, strongly affecting the vehicle dynamics and running stability. The aim of the paper is to expand the Switches and Crossing benchmark exercise analysing the effect of several kinds of irregularity with different wavelengths and amplitudes on a complete turnout on the main quantities related to the vehicle dynamics. The influence of each defect on each quantity is estimated through a post-processing sensitivity analysis based on power spectral density calculation. This sensitivity analysis is hence used to combine different types of defects in order to detect irregularity combinations that could compromise running safety.

J	Wang, G; Ji, YJ; Ren, LH; Leng, H; Huang, YP				Wang, Gang; Ji, Yuanjin; Ren, Lihui; Leng, Han; Huang, Youpei			Wheelset lateral force factor and critical offset distance of the centre pivot of articulated train	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Offset centre pivot; wheelset lateral force factor; critical offset distance; articulated train; curving performance	WAGON MODEL	The longitudinal distance between the centre pivot and the centre of end bogie significantly affects the wheelset lateral force of the outer and inner wheelset. Whether the centre pivot of end bogie of articulated train needs to be offset, and how to set the offset distance, research is still lacking. Taking this as a starting point, this study utilised wheelset lateral force factor to discuss the influence of the centre pivot offset distance on the safety of the wheelset lateral force and derived the formula for calculating the critical offset distance of the centre pivot. Taking an articulated tram with three car bodies and four bogies as an example, a force analysis model for steady-state curve negotiation was established, and the relationship between the wheelset lateral force and the offset distance of the centre pivot was derived, which was verified by the dynamic model. When the maximum value of the wheelset lateral force factor of each bogie reached the minimum, the optimal centre pivot offset distance was obtained, which was called the critical offset distance. The influence of the offset states of the centre pivot on the curving performance of the tram was analysed by the dynamic model. The results showed that derailment coefficient, wheelset lateral force factor, and lateral displacement of end car bodies in the critical offset state were smaller than them in other offset states.

J	Niu, JQ; Wang, YM; Liu, F; Li, R				Niu, Jiqiang; Wang, Yueming; Liu, Feng; Li, Rui			Numerical study on comparison of detailed flow field and aerodynamic performance of bogies of stationary train and moving train	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						High-speed train; bogie; flow field; ground condition; IDDES	HIGH-SPEED TRAINS; DETACHED-EDDY SIMULATION; REYNOLDS-NUMBER; SNOW ACCUMULATION; WAKE FLOW; WIND; SLIPSTREAM; CROSSWIND; PRESSURE; IMPACT	In this study, the aerodynamic forces on a stationary train and moving train as well as the flow fields at the bottom of the trains were compared and analysed. In addition, the numerical algorithm used in the simulation with a stationary train was verified by wind tunnel experimental data. The results show that the distribution law of the drag of the train (without bogie) and bogies is evidently altered by the train motion (stationary and moving) relative to the lift force of the train and bogie. The effect of the train motion on the fluctuation of the aerodynamic forces is significant. The distribution law and amplitude of the velocity field at the bottom of the train are significantly affected by the train motion, particularly in the region around the bogie. The influence of the train motion on the pressure field is relatively marginal.

J	Liu, XY; Goodall, R; Iwnicki, S				Liu, Xiaoyuan; Goodall, Roger; Iwnicki, Simon			Active control of independently-rotating wheels with gyroscopes and tachometers - simple solutions for perfect curving and high stability performance	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Independently-rotating wheels; active control; curve negotiation; stability; dual-loop control	RAILWAY WHEELSETS; STRATEGIES; VEHICLES	Although a passive independently-rotating wheel-pair (IRW) is not well suited for curve negotiation due to an inability to provide the necessary steering, an active IRW system offers the potential to realise perfect curving with a satisfactory running stability. Simple control solutions to realise automatic steering and stability of the IRW system are proposed in this paper. In this control approach, only gyroscopes and tachometers are adopted for the measurements. Associated with a prototype of a two-axle IRW vehicle, the active control strategies for both motor-driven and actuator-driven solutions are illustrated. The simulation results demonstrate significant alleviations in the wheel/rail interactions with perfect-curving performances and superior running stabilities owing to the proposed control strategies.

J	Xu, L; Lu, T				Xu, Lei; Lu, Tao			Influence of the finite element type of the sleeper on vehicle-track interaction: a numerical study	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Vehicle-track interaction; sleeper finite element; frequency response function		In the framework of vehicle-track interaction, this work puts an emphasis on clarifying the influence of sleeper finite element types on system dynamic responses. Three sleeper element types, namely the rigid-body, extensible Euler-Bernoulli beam and solid element are used respectively in the track system modelling with detail mathematical formulations presented. The rails are modelled as Timoshenko beams. The ballasted track system is subject to a moving vehicle with coupled wheel-rail interactions. From aspects of both frequency- and time- domain analysis in the numerical study, the effectiveness of this model has been validated.

Moreover, it is known that track irregularities are massive data, possessing evolution characteristics at time and space domain, thus it will consume much time if directly loading all of them into the vehicle-track interaction process. Regarding this, this work tries to introduce the track irregularity probabilistic model to select representative track irregularity sets with much smaller samples. To guarantee the representativeness of track irregularity data, track irregularities of up to five thousand kilometres are measured to ensure the ergodicity of the power spectral density function (PSD) of the track irregularities. Moreover, a fast-accurate contact model is introduced to extract the stress distribution of the wheel-rail contact patch. By effectively combing the vehicle-track dynamics method and random simulation methods, the wheel and rail contact stresses in amplitude and distribution range can be efficiently quantified from a statistical view.

This study examines the coupled torsion vibration responses of a transmission system in a vehicle-track vibration environment. It considers the time-varying mesh stiffness, nonlinear damping characteristics, wheel flexible deformation and wheel-rail interactions. The results are compared to those of previous works as a means of validation. Then, the dynamic characteristics of the transmission system and its coupling effects are investigated along with gear eccentricity, which describes the torsional vibration properties in the vehicle-track coupled system more comprehensively. The results show that the traction torque and gear eccentricity affect the gear meshing, vibration amplitudes and frequency multiplication of the transmission system during the vehicle acceleration process. The eccentricity, especially of the pinion, has a great effect on vibration in the transmission system at high-speed ranges. Also, the dynamic responses of the wheels of the same motor car wheelset are different under traction conditions, which should not be neglected when assessing the torsional dynamic performance. The model provides a useful source of reference for the design and condition monitoring of traction systems for high-speed trains.

J	He, YP; Han, J; Zhou, Q; Sheng, XZ				He Yuanpeng; Han Jian; Zhou Qing; Sheng Xiaozhen			An improved finite element model for three-dimensional wheel-rail rolling contact	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Implicit and explicit finite element method; three-dimensional wheel-rail rolling contact model; wheel-rail interaction; stable time	PLASTIC-DEFORMATION; STRESS-ANALYSIS; IMPACT; SQUAT; JOINT	A three-dimensional wheel-rail rolling contact model (3D WRRCM) developed using the explicit finite element method (FEM) can be used to analyze the dynamic performances of wheelsets and tracks while considering the wheelset rotation and translation, as well as the real wheel-rail contact mechanism. When using the FEM with static initialisation (traditional model), the first step is to calculate the static wheel-rail displacement, strain, and stress when applying axle loading on the wheel and neglecting the wheelset rotation and translation. Then, using these results as the initial conditions, the dynamic wheel-rail displacement, strain, and stress are calculated while considering the wheelset rotation and translation by adopting the explicit dynamic solution method. However, obtaining a solution using this traditional method is time consuming, and the solution can be divergent because of the impulse produced by the suddenly increasing wheelset rotation when proceeding from the initial condition to the dynamic. The optimised method developed in this study can solve this problem. A comparison of the results from the traditional and optimised methods reveals that in the optimised method, the softer initial impulse effectively shortens the track length needed for the calculation and improves the solution efficiency.

In recent years, evolving communication technologies are making vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure faster and more reliable; with such advancements, these crashes, as well as their economic cost, can be partially reduced. In this work, we concentrate on straight path intersection collisions. Connectivity-based algorithms relying on 5G technology and smart sensors are presented and compared to a commercial radar AEB logic in order to evaluate performances and effectiveness in collision avoidance or mitigation. The aforementioned novel safety systems are tested in a blind intersection and low adherence scenarios. The first proposed algorithm is obtained by incorporating connectivity information into the original control scheme. The second proposed algorithm is a novel control logic fully capable of utilising the adherence estimation provided by smart sensors. Test results show an improvement in terms of safety of the control architecture and high prospects for future developments.

Our concept revolves around a control allocation framework, extended with Lyapunov-based stability constraints and costs. Besides the ability to cope with actuator constraints and optimal actuator reconfiguration, the proposed Lyapunov-based control allocation (LCA) allows the graceful degradation of control performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison with classical control allocation, the proposed LCA reduces tracking errors of the motion controller in the aftermath of actuator faults. Experimental tests carried out with the ROboMObil, a robotic electric vehicle prototype with wheel-based steering and traction actuation, demonstrate the effectiveness of the LCA.

Performance assessment of urban goods vehicles	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Truck; bus; high speed; articulated vehicle; 4WS		Controlling greenhouse gas emissions is becoming increasingly more important. With road freight contributing to a significant amount of energy usage, finding ways to improve this sector will, in turn, lead to large reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, with one method to achieve this being to use larger vehicles. Currently, prescriptive legislation dictates the dimensions a vehicle can take. An alternative to this is to use 'Performance-Based Standards (PBS)'. This involves determining a set of manoeuvres and performance metrics that a vehicle must perform and pass in order to be road-worthy, instead of saying a vehicle can be a certain size or a certain weight. Through innovation and optimisation, using this method will then allow larger vehicles that are safe for driving on the road to be built. The research conducted here involved creating a PBS framework based on low-speed manoeuvrability for rigid delivery vehicles as well as assessing the high-speed stability of articulated vehicles to determine whether they would be safe for use on urban roads. Additionally, design changes such as incorporating rear axle steering were considered to determine whether vehicles that had failed the proposed PBS framework could be made to pass.	[Isted, C.

J	Kang, J				Kang, Juyong			Robust estimation method of tire torsional resonance frequency to detect decrease in tire inflation pressure	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Resonance frequency estimation; Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System		Indirect tire pressure monitoring system monitors inflation pressures in pneumatic tires using wheel speed sensor (WSS) signals acquired from anti-lock braking system. In order to monitor the tire pressures indirectly, frequency analysis and wheel radius analysis are operating in parallel. This paper focuses on the frequency analysis. The resonance frequency of tire torsional vibration decreases as the tire pressure decreases. Therefore, the resonance frequency needs to be estimated to detect tire pressure decrease. This paper describes the resonance frequency estimation method with the WSS. Firstly, toothed wheel error of the WSS is calculated from the wheel speed signals and the wheel speed is corrected with the toothed wheel error. A notch filter is designed based on the engine rotational speed to eliminate the engine noise. The resonance frequency is estimated by model parameter estimation based on auto regressive model. Finally, compensation of the estimated frequency, detection of snow chain and monitoring of severe driving environments have been proposed to prevent false alarms at normal tire pressures. Vehicle tests have been conducted to evaluate the proposed estimation method of the resonance frequency. It has been shown that the proposed method provides satisfactory performance for warning indication of tire pressure loss from the test results.

J	Wu, J; Qiu, Y				Wu, Jun; Qiu, Yi			Analysis of ride comfort of high-speed train based on a train-seat-human model in the vertical direction	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Ride comfort; train-seat-human model; geometry filter effect; vertical vibration	CAR BODY; VIBRATION ANALYSIS; RIDING COMFORT; RAILWAY; CARBODY; REDUCTION	A rigid-flexible coupled train-seat-human model was developed for studying ride comfort of rail vehicles. The weighted acceleration r.m.s. value at the seat pan was used for assessing ride comfort. The contribution of different modes of the carbody to ride comfort was defined from the perspective of power spectral density. The role of first bending mode was more important than other bending modes when bogie and seat positions are far from the nodes of first bending mode. Under this situation, the bogie spacing filter effect of first bending mode can be adopted to predict peaks and troughs of the equivalent acceleration on the floor or human-seat interface varying with speed or first bending frequency. The incorporation of human-seat system was necessary in order to accurately evaluate ride comfort. The ride comfort exhibited a global trend of improvement with increased bending rigidity or reduced speed. Increasing the damping ratio of bending modes improved ride comfort effectively. Increasing stiffness or decreasing damping of human-seat vertical contact on the seat pan worsened ride comfort. Equivalent accelerations at symmetrical seat positions showed analogous tendency as the speed. Ride comfort was worst at two ends whatever the speed was, followed by carbody centre at high speed.

Development of railway track condition monitoring from multi-train in-service vehicles	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Remote condition monitoring; safety improvement; network performance improvement; rough ride improvement; railway track maintenance improvement		A cab-based track monitoring system has been developed which makes use of the existing on-board GSM-R cab radio present in the majority of trains operating in the UK. With the addition of a low-cost sensor, type, location and severity of the track defects are reported using the system. The system improves safety and network performance by efficiently directing maintenance crews to the location of defects, minimising time spent on maintenance and inspection. Initially, vehicle dynamic simulation was used to test the feasibility of the system for defect monitoring and to develop compensation factors for vehicle type and operating speed. Novel on-board signal processing techniques are also presented through comparison of vibration response from sites with known defects and outputs from Network Rail's (NR) New Measurement Train (NMT). Good agreement was reported for track faults in relation to vertical and lateral alignment and dip faults. Statistically, good agreement has been demonstrated, suggesting that the data acquired could be used to provide an indication of track quality thereby improving network performance, reducing rough ride and leading to improved passenger comfort. Improvements in the measured and statistical correlation are anticipated through the use, of multi-train / multi-journey and machine learning methods..

Physical constraints of the actuator in the pneumatic brake system such as operating bandwidth and delay were considered in the design. The slip regulation scheme was designed using Power Rate Exponential Reaching Law (PRERL) based Sliding Mode Controller (SMC), which is a new strategy employed for ABS application. This technique consists of both chattering mitigation and robustness properties. Additionally, the effect of actuator delay on performance deterioration of the slip regulator was studied and an appropriate method was developed to mitigate it. The complete design was evaluated in a Hardware-in-Loop (HiL) experimental setup for several cases of road and load conditions and seen to regulate slip fairly accurately with an average tracking error of . Further, the stopping distance reduction was up to with the controller. The developed algorithm was found to be robust to of mass variations and of road surface variations.

However, the control of vehicle yaw rate is very challenging due to (1) the unmodelled nonlinearity and uncertainties in vehicle dynamics; (2) timely response in control scheme. These two issues can be simultaneously alleviated through a random projection neural network (RPNN) for its high model generalisation and fast computational speed. However, typical RPNN cannot be directly applied to adaptive control applications. Therefore, a new RPNN-based adaptive neural control method is proposed, which is equipped with a newly designed adaptation law based on the theorem of Lyapunov stability. To test the performance of the proposed control method, simulations were carried out using a validated vehicle model. The simulation results show that, compared to conventional backpropagation neural network (BPNN) based controller, the proposed RPNN-based adaptive controller can reduce the response time and attenuate oscillatory steering in the case of cornering manoeuvre under fast variant vehicle speed. The results also demonstrate that the proposed RPNN-based adaptive controller outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzy logic controller and the error feedback controller in multiple aspects including tracking nominal vehicle yaw rate, desired sideslip angle and intended path, showing its significance in vehicle yaw stability control.

Combining this information with the signals obtained from conventional vehicle sensors, e.g. inertial measurement units, wheel speed sensors and steering wheel angle sensors, improves the estimation accuracy of the states used by the vehicle dynamics controllers of production cars. This study assesses the performance improvement brought by the vertical and longitudinal tyre contact force signals, obtained through smart tyres, to an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for vehicle speed and sideslip angle estimation, based on a nonlinear vehicle dynamics model. Two UKF designs, excluding and including smart tyre information, are compared by using experimental data from a purposely sensorised high-performance passenger car, along a comprehensive set of manoeuvres. The results show average similar to 60% and similar to 37% reductions of the root mean square values of the normalised vehicle speed and sideslip angle estimation errors for the filter design receiving the smart tyre information. In comparison with the more conventional UKF design without tyre force inputs, the smart tyre based estimator is also characterised by significantly enhanced robustness and adaptability to typical variations of vehicle and tyre parameters, such as the tyre-road friction coefficient.

A strategy to achieve these purposes is to design All-Wheel Drive (AWD) vehicles with active torque distribution. Nowadays, effective technical solutions for powering the front wheel of a motorcycle have been proposed. The use of traction on both front and rear wheel is convenient when tyre friction is low, enhancing vehicle safety and performance. In this context, this paper presents a sensorless, open-loop traction strategy for AWD motorcycles that improves performance and stability both in straight running and in cornering, without requiring the knowledge of road-tyre adherence. This novel traction distribution strategy is based on the idea of maximising the area of the motorcycle performance envelope, also known as g-g diagram. A simplified mathematical model is used to find closed-form solution to this problem, then converted into a control algorithm for the front and rear driving torques. The performance of the proposed method is assessed with simulations: a detailed model of a light electric motorcycle is used for calculating the non-linear vehicle performance envelope, the acceleration response in straight running and cornering, and the response to road irregularities. Moreover, a comparison with feedback slip-based traction control system is conducted. Simulation results indicate that the AWD motorcycle outperforms the conventional rear wheel drive motorbike almost in all situations, especially when road-tyre adherence is low, and that no counter-indication for the adoption of the AWD architecture exists.

Ideally, overhead wires would run at a constant height parallel to the track, however, gradients are often unavoidable due to clearance limitations requiring lower wire heights at bridges and tunnels, and higher heights above level crossings. In this study, the influence of a range of contact wire gradients on the contact force between the overhead line and pantograph has been studied using a validated finite element model. Introducing a windowing technique to identify discrete dynamic behaviours found that overhead wire gradients can be increased with minimal effect on the contact force, showing current wire gradient limits are conservative. This may open up opportunities for electrification, less disruptive than following current standards.

For this reason, guard rails are commonly used to prevent secondary damage caused by derailed trains on high-risk lines. In this paper, a 3D vehicle-track dynamics simulation model and a collision contact model were used to investigate the post-derailment dynamic behaviours of the train as well as the effectiveness of guard rail protections. Variables studied include derailer oblique angle, the gap between running rail and guard rail, the effect of derailing speed on the posture, and impact force after derailment. The study shows that the oblique angle has a strong influence on the dynamic derailment behaviours. At a large gap, the bogie generates a noticeable distortion, which is very detrimental to the derailed vehicles. It was found that when the gap is 200 mm, the derailed wheelsets roll on the sleepers stably. And high derailing speeds can also cause significant impact forces. These simulations further the theory of train running posture and impact response, and can inform good railway design and maintenance.

The accelerations of the linear motor and levitation module were measured during powered running as well as idle running. Data analysis indicates that the vertical and longitudinal forced resonance of the PMLSMs result in the abnormal vibrations. The idle running tests imply that the excitation force comes from the vertical attraction force between the permanent magnets of the motor and steel sleepers. These results point out the direction of dynamic optimisation of the bogie.

The catenary is described by a finite-element model while the pantograph, vehicle and track are described by a multi-body model. In addition, different track irregularities are introduced to mimic real track conditions. Through Pearson correlation coefficient and spectrum analysis, the key kinematics parameters are identified, which influence both roof vibration and current collection quality. Frequency response of the TVPC shows that the forces between wheel and rail caused by track irregularities are transmitted to the bogie frame and vehicle body through primary and secondary suspension system, and finally to the PACS. Applying a series of excitation to the pantograph base frame and simulating the interaction between the PACS, the mechanism that the vehicle roof vibration affecting the PACS interaction is verified. Specifically, characteristic frequencies of the vertical displacement of the roof, which are related to the antiresonance and anti-phaseresponse of the pantograph, together with their corresponding amplitudes can be utilised to assess the influence of the body vibration caused by track irregularity on the current collection quality of PACS.

However, conventional active safety systems that mainly depend on braking intervention may not yield the desired vehicle behaviour in critical situations where the tyre forces tend to saturate. Over-actuation through individually cambering the wheels provides a possibility of overcoming this difficulty, as extra lateral tyre forces can potentially be produced. This paper presents active camber for improving the path following and yaw stability performance of over-actuated autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs). With a modified Dugoff tyre model, the camber effect on the lateral tyre force is modelled as an effective linear component. The modified tyre model, together with a double-track vehicle model, is utilised for active camber of the AEVs. The camber controller is developed in the framework of model predictive control (MPC), including both actuator- and safety-related constraints. The camber controller is investigated at different camber rates and road friction levels, in terms of path following, yaw stability and vehicle velocity gain.

The curvature of track is the key parameter of active radial system. In order to acquire this parameter in real time, a new method of curvature measurement based on secondary suspension rotation angle sensing is proposed in this paper. It is proved that this scheme can measure the curvature with small error and high synchronisation by theoretical deduction and simulation. Then, based on the curvature measurement scheme, an active radial system for rail vehicles is proposed, with emphasis on the design of an integrated device for wheelset constraints and actuator. Subsequently, the physical model of the actuator is established, and its dynamic response characteristics under typical working conditions are determined. Finally, the effect of the active radial technology of railway vehicles based on secondary suspension rotation angle sensing is analysed by the whole vehicle dynamic model with active radial function. The results show that the curvature measurement scheme is feasible, the curving performance of a rail vehicle under active radial control is improved significantly, and the thrust of the actuator is low. The research results can provide an engineering reference for real-time curvature measurements and active radial systems.

J	Yuan, ZD; Luo, J; Zhu, SY; Zhai, WM				Yuan, Zhandong; Luo, Jun; Zhu, Shengyang; Zhai, Wanming			A Wasserstein generative adversarial network-based approach for real-time track irregularity estimation using vehicle dynamic responses	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Track irregularity estimation; Wasserstein generative adversarial network; axle box acceleration; vehicle-track coupled dynamics	INTEGRATION	Accurate and timely estimation of track irregularities is the foundation for predictive maintenance and high-fidelity dynamics simulation of the railway system. Therefore, it's of great interest to devise a real-time track irregularity estimation method based on dynamic responses of the in-service train. In this paper, a Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN)-based framework is developed to estimate the track irregularities using the vehicle's axle box acceleration (ABA) signal. The proposed WGAN is composed of a generator architected by an encoder-decoder structure and a spectral normalised (SN) critic network. The generator is supposed to capture the correlation between ABA signal and track irregularities, and then estimate the irregularities with the measured ABA signal as input; while the critic is supposed to instruct the generator's training by optimising the calculated Wasserstein distance. We combine supervised learning and adversarial learning in the network training process, where the estimation loss and adversarial loss are jointly optimised. Optimising the estimation loss is anticipated to estimate the long-wave track irregularities while optimising the adversarial loss accounts for the short-wave track irregularities. Two numerical cases, namely vertical and spatial vehicle-track coupled dynamics simulation, are implemented to validate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method.

Firstly, the mathematical models for calculating the longitudinal forces in the longitudinal train dynamics simulations are formulated. The brake delay time between neighbouring cars and the pressure variation of the brake cylinders in the braking and releasing processes are considered in the air braking force model. Besides, the nonlinear hysteresis characteristic of the coupler-draft gear system is taken into account in the coupler force model. The Newmark-beta method is introduced as a numerical solver in this paper. Finally, the simulations based on the real-word infrastructure and vehicle data of the Shuozhou-Huanghua Line are carried out to study the longitudinal dynamics of the combined heavy haul trains with two distributed locomotives.

Six cases involving a locomotive (LM) and three different freight vehicles - a boxcar (BC), a tanker (TK), and a double-container freight wagon (DW), were compared and analyzed. The results showed that the aerodynamic drag was significantly affected by the freight train formation type, and the total drag force in Case 2 (LM + BC + DW + TK) was the smallest. Furthermore, the flow field around the train was analyzed to reveal the influence mechanism of the different types of freight train formations on the aerodynamic drag. The car position and the adjacent cars had significant effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of the train. The DW had a greater effect on the pressure and velocity distributions around the train.

To begin with, a novel tyre model is proposed by adaptively calculating the longitudinal and lateral stiffness and the effective friction coefficient. The tyre forces calculated by this model are more accurate than those calculated by the Brush model. Then, to avoid the influence of abnormal measurement noise on the estimation effect, we develop an improved SCKF (ISCKF) algorithm based on the maximum correntropy criterion. The algorithm can update the measurement noise covariance adaptively. Furthermore, a real-time estimation scheme of road friction coefficient is designed by combining the vehicle dynamics model with the proposed novel tyre model and ISCKF algorithm. Finally, the performance of the presented method is verified by the co-simulation of CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that the designed estimation scheme not only has excellent robustness in the case of abnormal measurement noise interference but also has good adaptability to the uncertainty of road friction coefficients distribution.

In order to reduce the CB elastic vibration, the suspension parameters of the underframe equipment in the roll direction were optimized. A simplified vehicle model including the roll motion of the CB and the underframe equipment was built for theoretical study, in which the modal displacement of the CB floor corresponding to the CB diamond mode was extracted from finite-element analysis. Based on the frequency response analysis, the frequency range in which the elastic vibration was magnified was obtained. By increasing the roll moment of inertia of the equipment and decreasing lateral distance between the suspension points, the roll frequency of the underframe equipment was decreased and the CB vibration was reduced. To verify the analysis, a three-dimensional multi-body dynamic railway vehicle system was established in SIMPACK.

A cooperative control strategy for yaw rate and sideslip angle control combining torque vectoring with rear wheel steering	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Torque vectoring; rear wheel steering; yaw rate control; sideslip control; electric motors; MIMO systems	STABILITY CONTROL; VEHICLE	Automobiles are becoming more and more complex as multiple control systems are integrated into the vehicle platform. This paper investigates the coordination of active rear steering (RWS) and torque vectoring (TV) - which is enabled by independent electric motors at the rear axle - in controlling vehicle lateral dynamics. The proposed controller aims at enhancing vehicle handling performance and stability while cornering. The coordination of the two actuators is achieved by weighting their contribution based on their impact on vehicle dynamics according to the working condition. The impact of each control system is assessed by means of phase portraits. These plots are a very powerful tool for analysing vehicle nonlinear dynamics as they readily display vehicle stability properties and map equilibrium point locations and movement to changing parameters and control inputs. Based on phase portrait analysis, a performance index is thus proposed, which weights more the control action (TV or RWS) capable of leading the vehicle at the nearest equilibrium point with the fastest rate. The controller performance is assessed through numerical simulations carried out using a nonlinear 14 dofs vehicle model. Results are compared with ones of the two controllers alone (RWS and TV) in different manoeuvers and adherence conditions.

J	Jin, ZB; Liu, WZ; Pei, SL; He, JZ				Jin, Zhibin; Liu, Weizhan; Pei, Shiling; He, Jinzhe			Probabilistic assessment of vehicle derailment based on optimal ground motion intensity measure	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Seismic; railway vehicle; derailment; intensity measure; fragility curves	HIGH-SPEED TRAIN; RAILWAY; METHODOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; SELECTION; CAPACITY; BRIDGES; DESIGN; MODEL	Railway vehicles frequently have derailed during major earthquakes. Although a probabilistic approach based on fragility analysis was established in structural engineering, it has never been applied to railway vehicles. Thus, the aim of this study was to select optimal intensity measures (IMs) and develop fragility curves for the derailment of vehicles. Eight commonly seen IMs were examined to determine their suitability for use in analyzing the derailment of vehicles. The railway vehicle response was analyzed using a nonlinear vehicle-track simulation, and 22 far-field and 28 near-field ground motion records were used as input. Based on the results of the simulation, the correlations of these IMs with the responses of vehicles were evaluated in terms of commonly accepted criteria in the literature, such as efficiency, practicality and sufficiency. It was found that spectral IMs were superior to peak-type IMs. In addition, the acceleration spectral intensity (ASI) and the velocity spectral intensity (SI) were shown to be optimal IMs for the evaluation of derailments. Using the selected IM (ASI), derailment fragility curves were developed for three levels of vehicle performance, which facilitated the probabilistic assessment of vehicle derailment in a performance-based manner.

Investigation of adhesion recovery phenomenon using a scaled roller-rig	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Adhesion; adhesion recovery; roller-rig; wheel-rail contact; friction	WHEEL-RAIL ADHESION; FRICTION MODIFIERS; WEAR	When high creep values occur on a braked/trailing wheelset running on a contaminated track, changes in the friction conditions take place. In fact, the work of the friction forces gradually removes the contaminant from the wheel and rail surfaces. Therefore, lower levels of adhesion are present on the leading wheelsets, while better conditions are restored on the following ones. A deep understanding of this phenomenon is needed to develop new algorithms for WSP and antiskid systems, in order to maximise the tractive/braking performances of railway vehicles. The research group of the Politecnico di Torino has recently designed an innovative multi-axle roller-rig to investigate the adhesion recovery phenomenon. First, the paper briefly shows the configuration of the new roller-rig, then focus is given to the experimental results obtained from adhesion recovery tests performed on the test bench.

Rule-based control of a semi-active suspension system for road holding using limited sensor information: design and experiments	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Semi-active suspension; controller; road holding; acceleration sensor	GROUND-HOOK; ADD	This paper presents a design of a rule-based controller for a semi-active suspension system that improves the vehicle road holding behaviour. This behaviour is quantified by the evaluation of the dynamic tire deflection at each of the vehicle's wheels. The control rule switches based on the product of the unsprung mass- and suspension deflection velocity and the excitation frequency. To determine how much the dynamic tire deformation is improved, the controller is compared to multiple passive suspension configurations as well as existing semi-active suspension controllers. The proposed controller is capable of achieving a minimal tire deformation over the entire frequency range of interest. Additionally, experiments are performed on a test vehicle which is equipped with semi-active dampers and the designed controller. In the experiments, the unsprung mass acceleration is measured since the tire deflection is impossible to measure in practice. A fixed trajectory has been driven for the controlled system and for a set of passive suspension configurations, a reduction of up to 11% of the root mean square (RMS) unsprung acceleration is seen compared to the best passive setup.

Under this condition, the wheel-rail interaction will be aggravated and the ride comfort of railway vehicles will be deteriorated. This paper presents an experimental and numerical investigation of the mechanism and countermeasures for the resonant response of a metro vehicle induced by eccentric wheels travelling on FS tracks. The characteristics of the resonant response of the metro vehicle are revealed through the field tracking tests. A vehicle-track model considering the FS tracks and eccentric wheels is developed to analyse the resonant mechanism. Several countermeasures, including optimal design of FS track structure and elimination of wheel eccentric wear, are proposed to restrain the resonant vibration. The results show that the resonance caused by the eccentric wheels moving over FS tracks is the root causes for the ride comfort reduction of the metro vehicle. The field tests validate that re-profiling eccentric wheels can significantly eliminate the resonance phenomenon and enhance vehicle dynamics performances.

Both feedback and feed-forward syntheses are performed via Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) optimisation. From a practical point of view, the proposed controller is simple and easy to implement, despite its theoretical complexity. In fact, the measurement of the driver steering angle and only one articulation angle are required for the feed-forward and the feedback controllers, respectively. The results are verified using a high-fidelity vehicle model and confirm a significant reduction in yaw rate and lateral acceleration rearward amplification and also high-speed transient off-tracking, and subsequently improving the lateral stability and performance of the A-double combination vehicle during sudden lane change manoeuvres.

J	Jiang, ZW; Liu, TH; Gu, HY; Guo, ZJ				Jiang, Zhiwei; Liu, Tanghong; Gu, Houyu; Guo, Zijian			Research on the reasonable end shape of the windbreak wall model in the wind tunnel test via numerical simulation	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						High-speed train; windbreak wall end; numerical simulation; aerodynamic performance	HIGH-SPEED TRAIN; AERODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE; RAILWAY VEHICLES; PART 1; FLOW; EMBANKMENT; SLIPSTREAM; BRIDGE; WAKE; CROSSWINDS	The improved delayed detached-eddy simulation (IDDES) method was used in this study to explore the influence of windbreak wall end shape on the wind tunnel test of the high-speed train aerodynamic characteristics. Affected by three different types of windbreak walls (long-enough, rounded-end, and blunt-end), the aerodynamic force, pressure distributions on the train surface, and flow fields around the train were compared and analyised mainly under a yaw angle of 30 degrees. A wind tunnel test was carried out to verify the reliability of the numerical calculation method. Windbreak walls with different end shapes mainly exert an effect on the flow field in the region between the front end of the windbreak wall and the nose of the head car. However, the influence on the aerodynamic load and surface pressure distribution of the train is local, so the end of the windbreak wall can be blunt for convenience in the wind tunnel test. In addition, the length of the windbreak wall is an important factor affecting the accuracy of the wind tunnel test.

Lateral bridge deformation has a significant impact on geometric parameters of the rail. In this paper, the influence of lateral bridge deformation on the train operation on the HSR bridge is investigated. Variational calculus is employed to establish the analytical mapping between the lateral bridge and rail deformation. By superimposing the mapped rail deformation and initial random rail irregularity, the composed rail unevenness under lateral bridge deformation is obtained. Thereafter, by adopting the dynamical model of the train-track-bridge coupling system (TTBCS), the dynamic behaviour of the train moving across the HSR track-bridge system is analysed. Based on safety and comfortability control indicators of the HST operation, effects of different types of lateral bridge deformations with various amplitudes on the train's operation performances are investigated. The results indicate that the bilateral girder's mutual translation has the most significant impact on the train's operation. When the HST is moving with the velocity of 350 km/h, lateral bridge deformation amplitude thresholds are suggested as 17.43 and 8.12 mm to ensure the safety and comfortability of the HST operation, respectively.

Field tests are conducted to ascertain the load characteristics of the slave control locomotive, and the coupler stability mechanism of the locomotive is studied. A dynamic simulation model considering the locomotive, adjacent wagons, and attached coupling devices is established and validated. Based on the model, countermeasures for improving the coupler stability are studied. The field test results indicate that: 1) the slave control locomotives suffer from sustained compressive forces less than 1500kN at the braking stage of cycle braking, while the maximum short-term impact force at the release stage exceeds 2000kN; 2) The coupler jack-knifing mostly occurs at the braking stage, and the yaw angles of the middle couplers are larger than the front and rear couplers. According to the theoretical analysis and dynamic simulation results, the coupler stability can be improved by increasing the stiffness of secondary lateral bump stops and reducing its clearance. Moreover, the proposed countermeasure of setting up lateral bump stop to locomotive couplers is proved to be effective to prevent the coupler jack-knifing.

This could offer a potential configuration for the mass production of electric all-wheel-drive vehicles because of reduced cost and complexity. Although there is no torque vectoring or direct yaw moment control in this configuration, considerable handling improvement can be achieved by optimised front/rear torque distribution due to the longitudinal and lateral tire force coupling. In this study, a model predictive control design is presented with a coupled force prediction model for vehicle handling dynamics. The controller optimises the front/rear torque allocation to track the desired handling response and ensure vehicle stability. This study also compensates for actuator delay by incorporating the actuator dynamics into the control design. The performance of the proposed controller is evaluated through software simulations and experimental tests conducted on an electric all-wheel-drive Chevrolet Equinox.

J	Luo, R; Liu, CD				Luo, Ren; Liu, Changdong			Dynamics simulation of the high-speed train using interconnected hydro-pneumatic suspension as a self-steering system	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						High-speed train; interconnected hydro-pneumatic suspension; self-steering radial bogie; dynamics simulation		The high-speed train needs excellent curve-passing performance, reducing wheel/rail force and wear, and sufficient hunting stability. According to the mechanism of self-steering radial bogie, the Interconnected Hydro-Pneumatic Steering system (IHPSS) is adopted as the primary longitudinal suspension element to realise the wheelsets' radial function. Four struts of the IHPSS are mounted between the four axle boxes and the bogie frame, longitudinally parallel to the bogie's arm nodes. The pipeline interconnection between the struts' different chambers allows the front and rear wheelsets to yaw in the opposite direction, and restricts the yaw motion in the same direction and the longitudinal movement. Four typical IHPSS configurations are made from various connection methods among different chambers. The static and dynamic characteristics of IHPSS are analysed, and the vehicle system dynamics simulation is carried out. The desired stiffness characteristics that improve the car body hunting and bogie hunting stability can be achieved by adjusting the structural parameters of IHPSS. The IHPSS can reduce car body hunting when wheel/rail equivalent conicity is small and bogie hunting under large conicity.

Firstly, a vehicle stability evaluation method is designed based on the front and rear tire slip angles phase plane and the quantitative stability index is derived according to the area where the states stay and the changing trend of the states. Secondly, a sliding mode controller (SMC) is designed to track the reference obtained by a two degrees of freedom (DoF) vehicle model as the desired vehicle motion. To enhance both vehicle handling and stability, the weight of the sliding surface is adaptively scheduled according to this stability index. The torque of each wheel is then distributed by solving the optimal adhesion rate consumption problem. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by CarSim-Simulink co-simulation. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed method can effectively improve vehicle handling and stability and has good robustness for the uncertainties of vehicle sideslip angle and road friction coefficient.

Most of the existing hunting monitoring methods detect only the large amplitude hunting instability (LAHI). However, the small amplitude hunting instability (SAHI) is still hard to be detected accurately and efficiently. To face this challenging problem, this paper describes a signal analysis based hunting instability detection methodology. The proposed method is based on cross-correlation techniques and is able to detect both SAHI and LAHI in a simple, efficient and effective way. Eight cross-correlation indicators (CCIs) are exploited to detect anomalous SAHI and LAHI conditions. A fully detailed dynamic model of one typical high-speed railway vehicle is developed to test the methodology and to compare the CCIs under different vehicle operating conditions. The most effective CCI and its critical values are determined on the basis of the statistics and comparisons of the simulation results. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed method to distinguish hunting instability and periodic excitations coming from track irregularities has been verified. Finally, the proposed instability detection methodology has been validated by detecting the SAHI successfully on field test data coming from specific experimental campaigns.

To objectively quantify the performance of given vehicle settings, minimum lap times can be determined using optimal control methods. The computed trajectories can be used to assess the benefits of certain actuators as well as to identify optimal vehicle setups and control strategies. This paper analyses the effect of rear-axle steering, longitudinal torque allocation via transfer case and selected vehicle parameters on lap time. The optimal roll moment distribution and longitudinal position of the centre of gravity are identified via concurrent optimisation. The optimal lap trajectories are generated by numerically solving a minimum-time optimal control problem using direct Hermite-Simpson collocation. To eliminate the problem of an unknown initial solution, the authors present an initialisation routine for vehicular optimal control problems.

J	Mickoski, H; Djidrov, M; Mickoski, I				Mickoski, Hristijan; Djidrov, Marjan; Mickoski, Ivan			Estimation and analysis of various influential factors in the braking process of rail vehicles	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Braking distances; stopping time; braking force; specific resistance; rail vehicle		Braking distances play an important role in the organization of rail traffic and exploitation of rail vehicles. The braking distances of rail vehicles affect several factors that cannot be defined and determined precisely. In this paper, a mathematical model, for train moving through braking, is presented by taking into account the relevant train braking resistance and a procedure is given for solving a differential equation of movement of the rail vehicle during braking. The procedure allows determining influential factors that have an effect on the length of braking distances. The influence and the changes of specific resistance during the movement of the train, braking force, and adhesion between wheel and rail during the braking process are presented. The results obtained with the presented mathematical model are accurate and match with the results obtained experimentally.

J	Wu, J; Qiu, Y				Wu, Jun; Qiu, Yi			Modelling and ride comfort analysis of a coupled track-train-seat-human model with lateral, vertical and roll vibrations	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Vehicle dynamics; ride comfort; track-train-seat-human model; multi-axis vibrations	RECTANGULAR-PLATES; NATURAL FREQUENCIES; VARIABLE THICKNESS; CAR-BODY; DYNAMICS; DEFORMATION; SIMULATION; PASSENGER; CUTOUTS	A coupled track-train-seat-human model with lateral, vertical and roll vibrations was developed to investigate the ride comfort of high-speed trains. The ride comfort was assessed by the total equivalent acceleration defined according to ISO 2631-1. It was found that the track flexibility had a minor influence on the lateral, vertical and roll floor vibrations below 20 Hz, while the total equivalent acceleration was overestimated by over 10% at high speed using a rigid track. The flexibility of the carbody generated dramatic floor vibration in lateral, vertical and roll directions above 7.5 Hz, so the rigid carbody model significantly underestimated the total equivalent acceleration. The total equivalent acceleration tended to increase with the increase of speed. The equivalent accelerations for two symmetric seat positions illustrated analogous trends with the increasing speed. The ride comfort was the worst close to the carbody ends, followed by the carbody centre at high speed. The vertical acceleration on the seat pan was the most severe whatever the seat position and speed are. The neighbouring subject brought about a reduction of the total equivalent acceleration for the subject under evaluation. The carbody damping can reduce the total equivalent acceleration effectively in the whole speed range.

The techniques covered include both quasi-steady-state and transient vehicle models, which are combined with trajectories that are either pre-assigned or free to be optimised. The fundamentals of nonlinear optimal control are summarised. These fundamentals are the basis of most of the vehicular optimal control methodologies and solution procedures reported in the literature. The key features of three-dimensional road modelling, vehicle positioning and vehicle modelling are also summarised with a focus on recent developments. Both cars and motorcycles are considered.

However, the included dynamics mechanism and influencing law have not been revealed completely. Based on the co-simulation method and vehicle-track coupling dynamics, a model which enables considering dynamic interactions between the electric drive subsystem and the mechanical subsystem of a locomotive through an electromagnetic coupling interface and motor control subsystem is developed in this paper. By using this co-simulation model, the dynamic responses of the mechanical subsystem and the electric drive subsystem are analysed under complicated dynamic excitation, such as the time-varying gear mesh stiffness and the track geometric irregularity. The results indicate an obvious interaction between the electric drive subsystem and the mechanical subsystem, where the vibration status of the major mechanical components can be reflected by the electric current signals. Besides, the characteristic frequencies of the gear transmission can be extracted from the frequency spectrum of the traction motor current signals, which provides the possibility for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of the locomotive mechanical components through the electrical signals.

In the present work, the effect of subgrade-end slope under a yaw angle of 30 degrees was investigated by delayed detached eddy simulation (DDES) using one-eighth-scale train and single-track rail models. The obtained results were validated with wind tunnel tests. Time-averaged aerodynamic coefficients, pressure distribution, and flow field around the train were analysed and compared in three cases with different subgrade-end slopes. The results show that, the lift force of three cars is reduced with increasing subgrade-end slope, while the side force is found to be increased with increasing slope; the overturning moment of head and middle car decrease but which of tail increase. The extreme values occur in the case of 60 degrees. Furthermore, the subgrade-end slope gives a variable impact on pressure distribution and flow pattern in different regions. This work has guiding significance for the selection of rail models in the subsequent train aerodynamic studies.

A three-dimensional free-trajectory quasi-steady-state optimal-control method for minimum-lap-time of race vehicles	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Minimum-lap-time; three-dimensional road; free-trajectory; quasi-steady-state; g-g map; MotoGP; Formula One; cars; motorcycles; Mugello; Barcelona-Catalunya circuit.		A method to solve minimum-lap-time problems using quasi-steady-state models and free (i.e. not predetermined) trajectory on two-dimensional tracks has been recently proposed. This work describes the extension of the method to three-dimensional tracks and builds upon g-g-g diagrams (instead of the standard g-g), to account for the effects of three-dimensionality. The main features of car and motorcycle g-g-g diagrams are discussed, to get insight into the main effects of three-dimensionality and to suggest a convenient parametrisation for the subsequent optimal control problem (OCP), whose size is not affected by the complexity of the vehicle model employed to generate the g-g-g diagrams. The application of the method to the Mugello and Barcelona-Catalunya circuits is given, with vehicle datasets resembling those of a race motorcycle (MotoGP) and a race car (Formula One). The results obtained are in line with those reported in the literature using full-dynamic models, yet such dynamic models are generally associated with the solution of much larger OCP.

J	Yang, YT; Liu, GX; Liu, CL				Yang, Youtao; Liu, Guoxiang; Liu, Chenglong			Fine interrelation between track irregularities and vehicle responses: multi-scale time-dependent correlation analysis	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Track irregularities; vehicle response; car body acceleration; multivariate empirical mode decomposition; time-dependent intrinsic correlation	SERIES	Track irregularities are perhaps the main excitations of vehicle-track systems and cause dynamic wheel-rail responses, but track irregularities and vehicle responses do not always correspond to each other. In this study, the interrelations between track irregularities and vehicle responses in a multi-scale framework were investigated using measured data. Firstly, the track irregularity and vehicle response data were separated into modes on different time scales using multivariate empirical mode decomposition, and the energy distribution of each wavelength component was determined. Then, the local correlations between irregularity-response mode pairs were examined via time-dependent intrinsic correlation (TDIC) analysis. The irregularity-response interrelation was not always unique, but rather varied in both time scale and time domain, and positive-negative correlation reversals frequently occurred, causing a low overall correlation and coherence. TDIC analysis can elucidate the wavelengths and positions of track irregularities that affect vehicle responses.

Study on semi-active control of running stability in the high-speed train under unsteady aerodynamic loads and track excitation	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						High-speed train; fluctuating crosswind; unsteady aerodynamic loads; running stability; semi-active control	SUSPENSION; VEHICLES	With the growing trend of higher running speed and lighter body weight in the high-speed train, the influences of fluctuating crosswind on running stability and safety are becoming more and more not negligible, especially under the combined action of unsteady aerodynamic loads and random orbital excitation. In order to investigate this problem, a vehicle dynamic model of with 42 degree of freedom is built, in which the major body, two bogies and eight wheels are involved. The unsteady aerodynamic loads under stochastically fluctuating crosswind are obtained based on Cooper theory and the harmonic superposition method, and the random excitation of the track is also taken into consideration. For the vertical vibration originated from the fluctuating crosswind and the random track spectrum, the skyhook damping and the magneto-rheological fuzzy semi-active control strategies are individually applied to suppress the vibrating amplitude and improve the running stability. It is indicated that the vertical vibration under the coupling influence of the unsteady aerodynamic loads and the random orbital excitation are significantly increased, and the vibrating amplitude can be effectively suppressed by both the two different control approaches. It is also shown that the index of running stability in the case of the fuzzy control is evidently better than the skyhook damping.	[Gao, Z. Y.; Tian, B.; Wu, D. P.; Chang, Y.

The tyre model performance test (TMPT) data is used to identify model parameters and verify this model. The results show that this model can accurately simulate the radial modal test, vertical stiffness test on flat surface and vertical stiffness test on cleat. The hysteresis and rolling characteristics of the tyre are analysed by using this model. In the loading and unloading simulation, after changing from loading to unloading, the tyre vertical stiffness becomes larger, and the vertical force decreases faster, resulting in hysteresis loss. With the increase of the tyre speed, the centrifugal force, the tyre profile and the footprint increase, resulting in the increase of the tyre vertical force and hysteresis loss. The vertical force and hysteresis loss of the tyre change with the speed in a square relationship. The results show that this model can accurately describe the vertical mechanical properties of the tyre.

With the use of a multi-body model of an electric locomotive, a sensitivity analysis of selected vehicle parameters on the maximum guiding force in the S-curve is performed. Subsequently, a definition of so-called equivalent guiding force is proposed. This simplified parameter can be used for the purposes of a quantification of the damaging effects of a vehicle in switches, e.g. in wear-dependent track access charge systems. Attention is also paid to the particularities of systems for active radial bogie or wheelset steering in conditions of tight S-curves and relevant requirements on these systems. The problem of a punctual on-board recognition of the S-curve is demonstrated using experimental data measured on an electric locomotive.

The implementation is performed in a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) simulation environment with a unique suspension test bed. The purpose of the control system is to achieve path-following functionality for the vehicle with automatic steering based on the proposed system. The paper proposes the design and the implementation of a hierarchical control system. The high-level control is responsible for the computation of the requested steering angle, and the low-level control aims to realise the steering angle through the intervention of the linear actuator in the suspension system. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is demonstrated through HiL simulation examples.

J	Chen, ZW				Chen, Zhaowei			Relationship between track stiffness and dynamic performance of vehicle-track-bridge system	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Vehicle-track-bridge dynamic interaction; high-speed railway; track stiffness irregularity; pitch movement; vehicle dynamics	PIER SETTLEMENT; TRAIN	Track stiffness irregularity is superficially invisible on rail surface, while causes dynamical impact and track deformation when trains running through. Aiming at this issue, this work presents an investigation on the influence of track stiffness on dynamic behaviours of the high-speed vehicle-track-bridge dynamic system. Primarily, a determination method of track stiffness irregularity is analytically deduced, in which a novel solution of deformation of free beam is proposed. Then a high-speed vehicle-track-bridge dynamic interaction model is established based on the vehicle-track-bridge dynamic interaction theory. On this basis, the influence of track stiffness on the dynamic behaviours of the coupled system is investigated both in time domain and in frequency domain. Results show that the distribution of track stiffness in longitudinal direction indeed affects the vibrations of the system. More vibration details of system in full frequency bands can be revealed by considering track elasticity. The most sensitive indicator to different track types is the pitch acceleration of bogie. The wave amplitude caused by length of slab is very small, however its influence on vehicle vibrations is great, indicating that tiny track stiffness change caused by length of slab cannot be ignored in dynamic investigations.

Experimental tests are performed by exciting the wheels of the bicycle with impulsive vibrations and measuring the frequency response functions (FRFs) between different sensitive points of the bicycle (i.e. seatpost and steerer tube) and the wheels. Laboratory tests are carried out with the rider on the bicycle, and the posture is carefully checked. A mathematical model is employed to predict the accelerations experienced by the rider on the road, considering tyre and wheelbase filtering. As a verification of the proposed methodology, comfort predictions obtained with the experimental-numerical method are compared with reference data obtained from road tests.

Combining the energy-variational principle with the vehicle-bridge interaction (VBI) system, a new framework of train-track system space dynamics is constructed. The present study has established the train-track-bridge coupled system (TTBCS) model, calculated the elastic-plastic seismic responses of the light rail transit bridge (LRTB) subjected to the combined effect of vertical and horizontal earthquakes. Considering three ground motion ensembles, i.e. pulse-like near-fault ground motions (NFGMs), non-pulse-like NFGMs, and far-field ground motions (FFGMs). Results indicate that the large vertical ground motions (VGMs) type NFGMs greatly impact the seismic response of the running safety of the LRV in the low-frequency band compared to the non-pulse-like NFGMs and FFGMs. The results underscore the significance of distinguishing velocity pulses of different types when selecting NFGMs for assessing the nonlinear dynamic response of the VBI system.

Stochastic failure process of railway vehicle dampers and the effects on suspension and vehicle dynamics	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Damper; stochastic dynamics; failure effects analysis; suspension dynamics; vehicle dynamics	SYSTEMS	Railway vehicle dampers undergo degradation and failure after long-term service. Bench tests in this paper indicate a stochastic failure process, in which damping characteristics follow bimodal random distributions between normal and failure; failure probability increases in the ageing process until it becomes deterministic. This failure mode may be neglected due to the probabilistic absence of failure, which poses great risk to reliability. Then, nonlinear suspension dynamics with stochastic failure is modelled; Ito stochastic differential rule and cumulant-neglect closure are adopted to derive moment equations. The scheme of progressive iteration is proposed to obtain fast-convergent and stable solutions for analysing the effect of stochastic failure process on vibration response. Further, numerical simulation of a vehicle with stochastic failure is performed for failure effects analysis on dynamical performance. The results demonstrate that the deterioration of failure probability and damping reduction amplitude leads to larger vibrations. The stochastic failure of secondary lateral damper and anti-yaw damper is harmful for lateral vehicle dynamics, while that of secondary vertical damper has negative effects on vertical ride quality. It is of great importance to pay full attention to the stochastic failure process of dampers for reliability and security of railway vehicles.	[Zeng, Y. C.; Song, D. L.; Zhang, W. H.; Hu, Z.

When the TSI are adversely affected by low-stiffness structures, the TGI maintenance workload increases sharply. Therefore, it is necessary to predict and evaluate the TDGS of low-stiffness URT viaduct to resolve the conflict between vibration-reduction design and track maintenance. First, the train-steel spring floating slab track-U-beam viaduct model is established. Second, virtual track inspection method is used to obtain the virtual dynamic irregularities. After comparing with actual measurement results, we investigated the influence of linetype, bridge span, and static irregularities on the security indexes and the TDGS. The results showed that for curved viaduct, in addition to vertical dynamic irregularities, alignment/horizontal dynamic irregularities also have characteristic wavelengths at 1/n times bridge span. The time-domain peak values were larger than those of the straight viaduct. Moreover, as the bridge span increased, the TDGS degradation of the curve viaduct was more significant than straight viaduct. The vehicle security indexes of the low-stiffness viaduct lines have large safety margin, while TDGS indexes are close or even exceed the limit when structures are improperly designed. This could bring insurmountable difficulties to the track maintenance.

To improve path tracking accuracy and ensure vehicle stability under handling limit conditions, this paper proposes a force-driven switched MPC path tracking control strategy that coordinates active front-wheel steering with an external yaw moment. Firstly, a linear time-varying tire model is modelled using the affine approximate linearisation method to describe rear tire dymamics. And vehicle dynamics is modelled to predict vehicle states in the prediction horizon. Then, a force-driven switched MPC control strategy is proposed based on the system prediction model. The vehicle lateral stability and rollover stability are restricted using maximum tire lateral force and the zero-point moment method, respectively. Finally, according to the simulation results under normal speed and limiting speed conditions, a force-driven switched MPC control strategy can improve control accuracy and ensure vehicle stability.

The investigations are an extension of the S&C simulation Benchmark with the addition of a finite element model of a 60E1-760-1:15 turnout. This model constitutes a common reference from which four different track formulations are derived: co-running, modal superposition, finite element incorporated into the MBS model and finite element coupled to MBS using a co-simulation approach. For the different track models, the difference in modelling technique, results, simulation time, and suitability for different simulation tasks is compared. A good agreement is found between the different track model formulations for wheel-rail contact forces and rail displacements. This study found a better agreement between co-running and structural track models compared to previous studies in the prediction of wheel-rail contact forces. This appears to be due to the increased complexity of co-running track model used in this study together with a tuning of the co-running track model to the reference model in a wider frequency range. For the reader interested to reproduce the results in this paper, the reference track model is available for download.

It shows that the conicities of the S1002 and LMA become smaller than the permitted minimum when rail cant 1/20 is used instead of 1/40 when matching with any of the three rail profiles. The conicity of S1002 decreases by up to 95% while that of LMA drops by about 30%. Whereas the RUS and LMB10 are compatible with two cants. Worn treads are more sensitive to the rail cant than new ones. Wheelback distance error leads to a conicity change, especially for worn profiles. A multi-body vehicle system dynamics analysis indicates that a 0.6 mm wheel-axle clearance leads to running instability at low speeds, but will not have an obvious effect on running safety and ride comfort. The vehicle dynamics behaviour on the standard- and broad-gauge tracks shows a slight difference. This has been validated through lab tests performed on a full-scale roller rig.

J	Chen, KY				Chen, Kun-Yung			A new state observer-based vibration control for a suspension system with magnetorheological damper	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Bouc-Wen model; magnetorheological (MR) damper; supplemental state observer (SSOB); supplemental state observer-based sliding mode control (SSOBSMC); suspension system	FLUID DAMPERS; MODEL; DESIGN	A new state observer-based vibration control strategy for the suspension system equipped with magnetorheological (MR) damper is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the Bouc-Wen model is implemented to fit the hysteresis phenomenon of the MR damper. A new dynamic model is successfully formulated including the Bouc-Wen model and electrical equation. According to the energy conservation law, an adjustable current is designed as the control object to adjust the characteristics of the MR damper to absorb the external input energy. Then, the current is assumed as an unavailable state for the suspension system, a supplemental state observer (SSOB) including the correction function and adaptation law is proposed to estimate it. Finally, a supplemental state observer-based sliding mode control (SSOBSMC) integrated with SSOB and sliding mode control (SMC) is proposed to estimate the unavailable current and perform robust vibration control, simultaneously. From the simulation results, the proposed SSOB shows outstanding state estimation ability for the suspension system. The SSOBSMC also performs outstanding state estimation ability and robust vibration control performance, simultaneously.

Calibration and validation of a freight wagon dynamic model in operating conditions based on limited experimental data	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Freight wagon; dynamic tests; model updating; genetic algorithm; vehicle-track interaction; validation	NUMERICAL-MODEL; RAILWAY; TRAIN; COMFORT; IDENTIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATION; VIBRATION	This article presents an efficient methodology for the calibration and validation of a numerical model of a freight wagon based on a dynamic test under real operation conditions. The dynamic test takes place during a regular journey of the train and involved the installation of on-board accelerometers and LVDTs, whose number and location was conditioned by the space occupied by the goods and constraints associated with loading and unloading the wagon. The data derived from the dynamic test was used for the identification of carbody's modal parameters, namely the frequencies, mode shapes and damping coefficients and to extract accelerations and displacements time-histories. A three-dimensional (3D) FE numerical model of the freight wagon was developed and calibrated using a genetic algorithm. The methodology proves efficiency and robustness in precisely estimating three numerical parameters, besides a significant upgrade in relation to the model before calibration. Model validation involved the comparison between numerically simulated results, based on a vehicle-track dynamic interaction analysis, and the experimental observations. An excellent agreement between experimental and numerical after updating time-histories was obtained, especially for the carbody responses, whose behaviour is governed by lower frequencies (below 3.5 Hz), in which the calibration process was focused.

To improve the lateral ride comfort of the vehicle, this paper proposed a new type of running gear called single air spring running gear (SARG), and according to the original loading conditions, the parameters of the SARG air spring are modified. By establishing a theoretical model of linear steady-state curve negotiation of the single-axle tyre running gear, the radial adjusting index is deduced to evaluate the radial performance of the SARG. By establishing the force analysis model of APM rolling in the static state, APM's flexibility coefficient is obtained to evaluate the anti-overturning capacity. The influence of running gear parameters on the flexibility coefficient is discussed in detail. Based on this, the stiffness of the SARG anti-roll bar is determined. By comparing the dynamic performance of both types of vehicles, the SARG advantages are proved. Finally, several improvements on the SARG structure are proposed for its adaptation to more complex scenario.

J	Chen, ZW; Bi, L; Zhao, JW				Chen, Zhaowei; Bi, Lin; Zhao, Jiangwei			Comparison of single-pier settlement model and multi-pier settlement model in solving train-track-bridge interaction	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Pier settlement model; train-track-bridge interaction; rail deformation; static analysis; dynamic analysis	DYNAMIC INTERACTION; PERFORMANCE; VEHICLE; SAFETY	Pier settlement is unavoidable in bridge construction and operation processes, thus the influence of pier settlement on the train-track-bridge coupled system becomes a classic and meaningful topic in railway engineering. Aiming at this practical problem, three interesting works are conducted in this paper: (a) a detailed single-pier settlement model (SPSM) is developed with analytic method; (b) a multi-pier settlement model (MPSM) is also analytically established in detail; and (c) the influences of SPSM and MPSM on the train-track-bridge system are investigated and compared. On this basis, the application ranges for different pier settlement models are suggested from static and dynamic perspectives. Results show that, from static perspective, SPSM and MPSM have the similarity, and results obtained from MPSM are the superposition of results calculated by SPSM. Computational efficiency of MPSM is lower than that of SPSM due to the large model scale. SPSM is suggested to study the static performance of the coupled system and to perform parametric analysis in dynamic investigation, while MPSM is suggested to investigate the system dynamics in frequency-domain.

Four schemes are demonstrated: (i) an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) scheme using a linear tyre model with stochastically adapted cornering stiffness, (ii) an EKF scheme using a Neural Network (NN) data-driven linear tyre model, (iii) a tyre model-less Suboptimal-Second Order Sliding Mode (S-SOSM) scheme, and (iv) a Kinematic Model (KM) scheme integrated in an EKF. The estimation accuracy of each method is discussed. Moreover, guidelines for each method provide potential users with valuable insight into key properties and points of attention.

Herein, a model-updating method based on the measured frequency response function (FRF) is proposed to modify the finite element model (FEM). To address the complexity of multiple measured responses and high cost of computation, the Kriging surrogate model with a multi-objective function considering the magnitude and shape of each measured curve is proposed. Thereafter, the surrogate model parameters are optimised to calibrate the FEM with the updated values. The model-updating results demonstrate that the simulated FRFs tend to coincide with the experimental FRFs. Moreover, the dynamic performance error of the calibrated model was validated in a rigid-flexible MBS model by comparing the calculated results of the vibration spectrum and ride comfort index with the test results. The results demonstrate that the updating procedure results in variations in the vibration response and ride comfort index, and the prediction of the updated MBS model is closer to the experimental results.

Model validation is carried out by comparing simulated results with test results of Shanghai high-speed maglev vehicles. Then, the proposed model is used to simulate the dynamic response of maglev vehicles with four different hanger lengths of 0.12, 0.18, 0.24, 0.36 m and passing through the straight track, the horizontal curve and the vertical curve. Simulated results indicate that because of the too short hanger maglev vehicles cannot pass through safely the sharp horizontal curve, and deteriorate the lateral dynamic performance of maglev vehicles on the straight track. The too long hanger may increase the lateral displacement of the carbody and lateral forces of rubber stops of maglev vehicles on the large-radius horizontal curve. The hanger length has little influence on the dynamic response of maglev vehicle on the vertical curve. In sum, the medium-long (0.24 m) hanger can provide a stronger curve negotiation capacity and better ride quality of high-speed maglev vehicles.

The proposed CSHIS system has significant improvements in stability and performance than the existing CSHIS systems. The CSHIS system uses a direction valve for configuration switching, and improves the overall vehicle dynamic performances. The developed NMPC algorithm enhances system stability and the actuator control process by predicting system states, and consequently improves dynamic performances and power consumption of the vehicle. A nonlinear CSHIS model is firstly established and discretised to predict system states which are used in the NMPC algorithm. Next, the NMPC-based controller is designed to optimise the actuator control process via two weighting factors which are related to dynamic performance and power consumption, respectively. Finally, numerical simulation and experiments on test bench are conducted to validate the proposed CSHIS system. The simulation results show that the proposed CSHIS system simultaneously improves anti-pitch and anti-roll properties compared with a conventional suspension system by 39.5% and 17.81%, respectively. The experiment results illustrate that the CSHIS system remains stable during and after the configuration switching and optimises the actuator control process by the weighting factors.

J	Rill, G; Bauer, F; Topcagic, E				Rill, Georg; Bauer, Florian; Topcagic, Edin			Performance of leaf spring suspended axles in model approaches of different complexities	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Leaf spring suspension; five-Link model; beam-Model; design Kinematics; vehicle dynamics; commercial vehicles	OF-THE-ART; DYNAMICS	Axles with leaf spring suspension systems are still a popular choice in many commercial vehicles. However, leaf springs are not in perfect conformity to standard multibody vehicle models because they combine guidance and suspension in one single element. Combining standard multibody vehicle models with sophisticated finite element leaf spring models results in rather complex and computing time-consuming solutions. Purely kinematic models, defined by lookup tables or the design kinematics approach, cover only some but not all features of the leaf spring suspension. As shown here, the five-link model, which incorporates a quasi-static solution of the leaf spring compliance, provides a very practical model. It is comparatively lean and provides results of sufficient accuracy in the whole application range.

J	Pierro, E; D'Angola, A; Carbone, G				Pierro, Elena; D'Angola, Antonio; Carbone, Giuseppe			Road vehicles travelling with time-dependent speed: theoretical study on the directional stability	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Vehicle dynamics; directional stability; Floquet theory; bicycle model; road vehicles		In this paper, directional stability of road vehicles travelling at time-dependent forward velocity is investigated. The dynamical behaviour of the system is governed by a set of linear ordinary-differential equations with time-varying coefficients. A simple two degrees of freedom (DOF) model is considered, in order to better understand the effects of such a perturbation on the well-established bicycle model, which is frequently used in the literature as a first approach to get useful physical insights on vehicle dynamics. Numerical simulations show significative differences with respect to the prediction of the stability analysis in the case of constant forward speed. A moderately large variation on the forward velocity, indeed, can stabilise the vehicle which is statically unstable.

The wheel roughness measured in the field sites indicates that some wheels suffer from discrete wheel irregularities, such as wheel flats or local defect. Meanwhile, the wheels exhibit obvious polygonisation. A wheel wear model is present to study the influence of discrete wheel irregularities on locomotive wheel polygonisation, which consists of a flexible-rigid locomotive-track coupled dynamics model and a wear calculation model based on the frictional work of wheel-rail contact patch. A series of discrete irregularities with different wavelengths are taken as initial input of irregularities. The wheel-rail interaction and wheel polygonisation evolution process induced by discrete wheel irregularities are analysed. The simulation results indicate that discrete wheel irregularities can excite the structural elastic vibration of the wheelset, especially the wheel lateral vibration, which leads to oscillations of the lateral creepage and creep force in a certain frequency. Wheel polygonisation is formed finally resulting from the fluctuation of wheel-rail creepages and creep forces. The frequency-fixing mechanism of wheel polygonisation with wavelengths of 630 and 200 mm in 1/3 octave band are the coupling of parameter excitation of discrete sleeper support with P2 resonance and lower bending resonance of the wheelset, respectively.

J	Bartolozzi, M; Savino, G; Pierini, M				Bartolozzi, Mirco; Savino, Giovanni; Pierini, Marco			Novel high-fidelity tyre model for motorcycles to be characterised by quasi-static manoeuvres - rationale and numerical validation	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Motorcycle tyre; motorcycle dynamics; tyre model; tyre forces and moments estimation; simulation; quasi-static manoeuvre	SCOOTER TIRES; STABILITY	Although diverse tyre model formulations exist in the literature, they are suited for characterisation using a dedicated test bench, preventing parameters' estimation in driving conditions. This study defined a novel motorcycle tyre model, characterisable through driving manoeuvres using simple instrumentation consisting in an inertial measurement unit, steering position sensor and wheel speed sensors. Acquired signals were used to estimate instantaneous tyre forces, moments, slip angle and other properties, which were employed to calculate tyre model's parameters. Tyre model development and validation were performed in a simulation environment: we used a Magic Formula tyre-equipped motorcycle model to perform a set of manoeuvres, which were employed to characterise the proposed tyre model. Lastly, a set of quasi-static manoeuvres was conducted using the same motorcycle model equipped with the two tyre models, and results were compared. Comparison results showed a close reproduction of real tyre forces, moments and slips by the proposed tyre model for quasi-static manoeuvres, accurately reproducing motorcycle dynamics. Therefore, steering torque was correctly predicted for different lateral acceleration values. These results show that the proposed tyre model can be characterised, for both longitudinal and lateral dynamics, using this limited set of manoeuvres and simple instrumentation; the correctly predicted steering torque could allow the use of this tyre model for handling description.

The basis for reliable simulation results are precise and easy applicable measurement techniques of the turnout geometry, like 3D handheld scanners. The challenge in using the data from portable 3D scanners for vehicle/track interaction simulation lies in the correct alignment and preparation of the measured surface. In this paper, a methodology for pre-processing of 3D scanner measurement results is presented, based on turnout measurements with the device HandySCAN 700 from Creaform. Point cloud processing methods like Principal Component Analysis and Iterative Closest Point algorithm are used to align the measured surface to a reference frame. Interpolation of the measured points by CAD reference data is applied for repairing the profile sections due to missing surface points. Furthermore, comparisons were made regarding the quality of simulation results for different input sources. It can be shown that the results have a good quality agreement in respect of different profile measurements techniques. Thus, it could be shown, that the data from the portable 3D scanner can be used for multibody dynamic simulation after appropriate preparation with the presented method.

J	Horvath, A; Beda, P; Takacs, D				Horvath, Adam; Beda, Peter; Takacs, Denes			Modelling and stability analysis of a longitudinal wheel dynamics control loop with feedback delay	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Active safety; stability analysis; tyre dynamics; control; vehicle safety	HIGH-GAIN OBSERVERS	Vehicle safety is an important field of today's engineering practice and the scientific research as well. One of the basics of the modern vehicle system dynamics control systems is braking or driving torque control. Ensuring proper connection between the tyre and the road surface is essential for safety and good handling behaviour. Fundamental questions may arise about the details of the model, such as feedback delay, sampling effect, numerical differentiation in the control algorithm or the dynamical characteristics of the tyre model. In this article, a connected dynamical system is presented which contains a wheel model and a PID type traction controller. Steady state and dynamical brush type tyre models are presented and compared. Two different ways are described to model the feedback delay. The fully continuous time model contains constant time delay, while there is another case, where the sampling effect and the numerical differentiation methods of the control algorithm are presented. Finally, stability analysis of the delayed system is performed. The stability and performance characteristics and different bifurcations are presented using stability charts. The type of the tyre model has significant effect on the stability characteristics.

J	Liu, BB; Bruni, S				Liu, Binbin; Bruni, Stefano			Influence of individual wheel profiles on the assessment of running dynamics of a rail vehicle by numerical simulation: a case study	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Running dynamics; wheel wear; wheel profile; critical speed; vehicle dynamics; multibody simulation		It is well known that wheel wear degrades the dynamic performance of the rail vehicles, especially in regard to the issue customarily known as 'running stability' and resulting in the evaluation of the vehicle's critical speed. Past research addressed this problem mainly from the viewpoint of the influence on the vehicle performance of the wear pattern. The aim of this work is to investigate the influence of individual wheel profiles measured on a rail vehicle on the vehicle's dynamics in the context of multibody (MB) simulations. The EN14363-based method, bifurcation map and the decreasing speed approach were implemented, and two new criteria were proposed based on the bifurcation map and decreasing speed schemes. Six methods were compared for assessing the vehicle's critical speed for a case study. The results show that different assumptions made in the MB simulations for the wheel profiles may have a significant effect on the assessment of system dynamics and that some of the methods used for the calculation of the vehicle's critical speed are more sensitive to the combination of profiles used. Therefore, the consideration of the peculiarity of each wheel profile is desirable for a detailed dynamics assessment of a vehicle in service.

J	O'Neill, A; Prins, J; Watts, JF; Gruber, P				O'Neill, Alexander; Prins, Jan; Watts, John F.; Gruber, Patrick			Enhancing brush tyre model accuracy through friction measurements	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Tyre model; brush model; friction; experiments		Accurate tyre models are important to ensure valid and reliable simulation of vehicle behaviour. To this purpose, the Magic Formula (MF) became the de facto standard for vehicle dynamics simulations, despite requiring many empirically derived coefficients. This paper shows how the accuracy of a simple physical-based brush-type tyre model can be enhanced to simulate tyre behaviour that closely matches MF results. To do so, the real, highly complex rubber friction characteristics are incorporated into the brush model. The friction characteristics were obtained from friction measurements with a tread rubber block. The developed model is validated against experimental tyre data obtained on a flat-track test rig and the corresponding MF model. Results show that the inclusion of friction characteristics allow accurate simulation of longitudinal and lateral slip conditions over a wide range of normal loads with the simple brush model. At extreme loading scenarios, the simulation accuracy deteriorates because of the significant influence of highly nonlinear deformation behaviour of the tyre that is not accounted for in the brush model formulation.

J	Gao, HW; Jezequel, L; Cabrol, E; Vitry, B				Gao, Hanwei; Jezequel, Louis; Cabrol, Eric; Vitry, Bernard			Chassis durability and comfort trade-off at early stage of project by virtual proving ground simulation	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Chassis durability; multi-objective optimisation; ride comfort; virtual proving ground; data mining		The simulation of vehicle chassis system is widely deployed at the early stage of a new car development project in order to verify if the technical specifications such as durability and comfort of current design are fulfilled. However, the numerical validations of specifications are usually carried out independently by project teams, which may fail to converge the final design at downstream phase of projects. This paper proposes an early stage multi-objective optimisation method which is able to search a set of best trade-offs between durability and comfort before the deployment of the chassis parameters. Virtual proving ground simulation is applied as a uniformed numerical validation platform, following the same process as in physical experiments, including global and local damage calculation, transfer function estimation and other comfort criteria. By realising the design of experiments on front and rear axles' global curves and key components in a deployable design space, the Pareto front can be obtained in several optimisation iterations. An application case on an example project shows the method succeeds in revealing the general trends between these two chassis specifications with acceptable simulation costs. The data-mining methods further demonstrate the design preferences and orientations of each group in the simulation database.

A hierarchical control scheme consisted of two control levels is designed to keep the vehicle handling and improve yaw stability control using the coordination of active front steering (AFS) and direct yaw moment control (DYC). At the upper control level, the desired yaw moment and additive steering angle are obtained through proper adaptive laws in the first level adaptation (FLA) control structure. A constraint optimisation algorithm is utilised in the lower control level to adjust the impact of the steering and braking actuators. The desired yaw moment is converted into the brake torques and effectively distributed to the wheels. Improvement in the yaw stability control is demonstrated through simulation studies for a nonlinear 8 degree-of-freedom (DOF) vehicle model. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed control strategy is compared with that of the adaptive controller without integration. Simulation results of two different maneuvers point to the superiority of the proposed approach, highlighting some of its appealing features, like better tracking performance with lower control efforts in terms of brake torque and steering angle, as compared to the conventional adaptive method.

J	Uhlar, S; Heyder, F; Konig, T				Uhlar, Stefan; Heyder, Florian; Koenig, Thomas			Assessment of two physical tyre models in relation to their NVH performance up to 300 Hz	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Review						Multibody-simulation; noise-vibration-harshness; tyre modelling; FTire; CDTire; cleat; rough road; frequency analysis	FTIRE	The prediction of structure-borne noise using numerical methods has a crucial influence during the development process of modern passenger cars. In order to minimise the dynamic forces from the chassis transferred to the body structure, multibody simulation (MBS) can be used. The link between the road surface and the chassis is established by the tyre and its own structural dynamic characteristics. Therefore, it is substantial and the main goal of the present paper to investigate the Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) performance of two commercial physical tyre models available and commonly used in the market. The intention is to point out what kind of results (up-to-date) a user of these structural dynamic tyre models, namely FTire and CDtire/3D, will get with a focus on NVH. The authors strictly follow the established process of how to obtain the fitted tyre property files, as any other user of FTire and CDTire currently does. This process includes a measurement campaign of the real tyre and a subsequent fitting of the tyre property file. The fitting in this case is provided by the tyre model developers themselves, namely cosin and Fraunhofer ITWM. The tyre models are then integrated into the MBS software MSC.Adams where their performance will be assessed based on measured wheel-hub forces in the time and frequency domain up to 300 Hz.

This is preceded by a self-excited vibration, referred to as front wheel patter, in the frequency range between 7 and 10 Hz. Aim of the present study is the identification of the actual switching mechanism to instability together with its governing parameters. A minimal model of the front assembly of a motorcycle is proposed, and its stability in equilibrium configurations is studied via eigenvalue analysis. The sensitivity with respect to all its governing parameters is analysed by means of stability maps and the self-excitation mechanism is explained with the aid of energy balance analysis and phase-diagrams. The results are compared to those existing in the literature and to numerical simulations obtained from a full motorcycle multibody model.

Identification of the track- or train-related rough rides via train crew can be estimated to the nearest kilometre. However, if the train is equipped with a monitoring system a better location and track quality evaluation can be provided. These systems commonly use information such as GNSS and/or an odometer to provide location information. This work proposes a practical method for track alignment estimation using real data from an in-cab inertial measurement system and using also a novel method based on crosslevel variations. The speed estimation is done through speed-related harmonics detected on inertial sensors, which depend on speed and track characteristics; and distance correction is provided by comparing crosslevel derived from inertial sensors and a reference track geometry. The effectiveness and accuracy of the method is demonstrated with data collected between London and Ashford.

This paper presents a wheel profile optimisation procedure consists of 3 steps. Firstly, taking the LM profile, which widely used in China metro vehicles, as an example, the rotary-scaling fine-tuning (RSFT) method is introduced to generate a large number of candidate profiles. Secondly, to quickly and reliably establish the relationship between the candidate profiles and the objectives obtained by multi-body dynamics simulation (MBS), the radial basis function (RBF) is introduced to reduce the number of MBS runs. Thirdly, the established RBFbased function is treated as the objective function of the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm to develop a wheel profile that simultaneously considers wheel wear and ride comfort for the B-type metro vehicles. Finally, this paper compares the wheel-rail contact characteristics, critical speed, and simulated long-term wear distribution of the LM profile and the optimised profile named as LMopt. The results show that the LMopt profile has better performance, demonstrating that the RSFT-RBF-PSO procedure is of engineering significance.

Selected investigations of the research community to develop technology solutions to reduce energy consumption are presented. The study explores the impact and potential of relatively mature technologies such as regenerative braking, but also recent research directions that are seeking to develop solutions such as regenerative suspensions, a concept common to both transport modes. Specifically for road vehicles, the study includes rear wheel steering, camber control and torque vectoring, and for rail vehicles active steering and light-weighting. Operationally, there would appear to be great potential for rail vehicles in the wider adoption of connected driver advisory systems, and automatic train control systems, including the application of machine learning techniques to optimise train speed trajectories across a route. Similarly, for road vehicles, predictive and cooperative eco-driving strategies show potential for significant energy savings for connected autonomous vehicles.

J	Loyola, J; Margolis, D				Loyola, J.; Margolis, D.			Variable wheelbase reference for vehicle with active front and rear-wheel steering	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Four-wheel steering; model reference; MIMO control; steer-by-wire; steering systems; autonomous vehicles; variable wheelbase		Rear-wheel steering has seen new popularity in recent years. Many explanations of rear-wheel steering systems use the concept of a 'virtual wheel base' to explain in-phase or out-of-phase steering. This paper introduces a novel reference model that realises this metaphor. A reference model is created where its wheelbase can be changed arbitrarily, making the resulting system intuitive and simpler to design and tune. This augments the properties of the reference model whose signals are used for a feedback control system. The real vehicle tracks these signals using active front and rear-wheel steering. This system can be implemented in a vehicle using steer-by-wire or an autonomous vehicle for control. A MIMO controller is derived and results show that the system operates as intended. Finally, a control law is proposed to change the virtual wheelbase using the road curvature. It is shown that it has advantages over conventional rear-wheel steering control.

To effectively improve the vehicle dynamic performance under different road conditions, this study proposes a switching control strategy for the semi-active suspension based on the road profile estimation. First, the mapping relationship between different driving conditions and requirements of vehicle dynamic performances is studied. Then, a switching controller with multiple sub-controllers is designed on the basis of the modified skyhook control. The optimal control gains are obtained by adopting the cuckoo search algorithm. In addition, to realise the automatic switching of the controller under different road conditions, an online road profile estimation method, including road disturbance estimation and road roughness classification, is developed. Bench test results show that the proposed control algorithm has an obvious effect on improving the vehicle ride comfort and handling performance, which verifies the effectiveness of the road estimation results and the superiority of the switching control strategy.

In this context, the development of a realistic adhesion model able to describe degraded adhesion conditions is still an open problem because of the complex non-linear behaviour of the adhesion coefficient. To face this problem, in this work an innovative degraded adhesion model has been developed taking into account important phenomena like large sliding at the contact interface, the consequent energy dissipation and the adhesion recovery caused by the cleaning effect on the rail due to the friction forces. The new approach, based on FASTSIM algorithm and Polach theory, is numerically very efficient and has been specifically designed for multibody applications. The developed model has been validated through the comparison with experimental data related to suitable braking manoeuvres.

J	Ren, ZS; Xin, X; Sun, G; Wei, X				Ren, Zunsong; Xin, Xin; Sun, Gang; Wei, Xue			The effect of gear meshing on the high-speed vehicle dynamics	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						High-speed vehicle dynamics model; transmission system dynamics model; gear meshing; vibration; field test	SYSTEM; VIBRATION; CONTACT; MODEL	The gear transmission system is a key part to transmit power for the electrical multiple unit (EMU) and to move the train forward. Its dynamic vibrations affect the operation safety and the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle. Based on the parameters of a certain type of high-speed EMU in China, a rigid-flexible coupling dynamics model of railway vehicle is developed. A flexible gear meshing dynamics model is built and it is incorporated into the vehicle system dynamics model. With the numerical method, the effect of the gear transmission on the dynamics of the high-speed vehicle is investigated. A field experiment is carried out and the measured accelerations of the gearbox are employed to validate the simulation results. The investigation results reveal that the gear meshing forces get large as the operation speed of the vehicle increases. Gear meshing affects the operation safety indexes and the vibrations of the bogie frames, motors and gearboxes, but has negligible effect on the vibrations of the carbody. The difference between the results with the flexible gear meshing model and the results with the rigid gear meshing model is negligible. The simulation acceleration is slightly smaller than the field test result of the gearbox.

Impact of regenerative braking torque blend-out characteristics on electrified heavy road vehicle braking performance	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Electric and hybrid vehicles; heavy road vehicles; co-operative braking; regenerative braking; brake torque blend-out characteristics; vehicle braking performance	ANTI-LOCK BRAKING; COOPERATIVE CONTROL; FRICTION BRAKING; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; HYBRID; EFFICIENCY; SAFETY	Electric and hybrid vehicles use a co-operative brake system that consists of regenerative brake and friction brake with different dynamic characteristics to obtain adequate deceleration during braking. Hence, the mechanism of braking blend-out (that is the mechanism of switching off regenerative braking) may affect the vehicle braking performance. This work focusses on the development of various co-operative braking strategies (series and parallel) for electrified heavy road vehicles by considering instantaneous braking blend-out and ramp down braking blend-out characteristics. The developed co-operative braking strategies were evaluated in a Hardware-in-Loop experimental setup equipped with TruckMaker(?) software. The results showed that instantaneous braking blend-out has more impact on vehicle braking performance in terms of momentary magnitude change in the longitudinal deceleration, pitch angle and suspension deflection for a laden vehicle compared with an unladen vehicle on both dry and icy road surfaces. Ramp down braking blend-out reduced these momentary magnitude changes and thereby improved vehicle?s braking performance in terms of stopping distance and ride comfort. The results of this study indicate that ramp down braking blend-out is expected to improve the vehicle dynamic performance during active braking control due to the smooth transition between friction braking torque and regenerative braking torque.

Among the various ride comfort indices, the Sperling index is widely used in China and other countries. However, there are several different methods for determining the Sperling index from dynamic simulations and performance measurements of rail vehicles, and the results obtained by different algorithms are inconsistent. It is therefore difficult to make an accurate evaluation with the different calculation results. In this paper, a comparison is made between algorithms based on time domain and frequency domain analysis and using the second and third powers of the acceleration. The different algorithms are then summarised into a unified equation, and the consistency of the results is analysed by this equation. It is found that only the r.m.s-based algorithm in the time or frequency domain is stable when analysis is carried out over different sample times. The time-frequency consistency of the r.m.s-based algorithms is verified by Parseval?s theorem and using calculation results from time domain simulations.

However, most of the existing research about that still belongs to single-objective optimisation and pays little attention to the matching relationship between different suspension parameters, which has plenty of limitations. Therefore, the lateral stability and ride comfort of a certain type of domestic high-speed locomotive are studied and optimised through the genetic algorithm NSGA-II, to find the optimal lateral dynamic performance. It can be found that there is an obvious contradiction between linear stabilities under low-conicity and high-conicity conditions, but a strong positive correlation between low-conicity stability and lateral ride comfort in a low-conicity condition. Besides, the matching relation of the six key suspension parameters is explored employing data analysis methods, such as global sensitivity and clustering analysis, and three types of parameter combinations are proposed. In addition, the speed robustness and rail cant robustness regarding the three types of parameter combinations are analyzed, and the lateral dynamic performance characteristics of each parameter combination type are summarised.

Wheel Slip Regulation (WSR) algorithms, that are constituents of an ABS, are typically either model-based or rule-based. Model-Based Algorithms (MBAs) utilise mathematical models that characterise vehicle dynamics and are intensive in their demand for real-time information. On the other hand, Rule-Based Algorithms (RBAs) operate on set rules with pre-defined thresholds and utilise data from sensors that are typically available on the vehicle. A great deal of advancement has been reported in literature related to MBAs. However, most commercially available RBAs are proprietary in nature and the finer details are seldom revealed. Hence, this work proposes an RBA, which is a combined Slip and Wheel Acceleration Threshold Algorithm (SWATA), including a framework for identifying the importance of thresholds and their magnitudes. SWATA was tested on a Hardware-in-Loop (HiL) setup across varying road and loading conditions, and it provided a maximum of 36% braking distance improvement compared to a case where it was inactive. An adaptive version - ASWATA - is also proposed that can adapt the thresholds according to the particular tyre-road interface. Additionally, a quantitative comparison of the proposed RBA with a Sliding Mode Control (SMC) based MBA, which was developed and tested on the same HiL setup, is presented. It was observed that the performance of the RBA was on par with that of the MBA for most test cases, but with minimal data requirements.

J	Wu, Q; Cole, C; Spiryagin, M				Wu, Qing; Cole, Colin; Spiryagin, Maksym			Characterising stochastic friction in railway draft gear	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Railway draft gear; laboratory testing; dry friction; stochastic feature; dynamics simulations		The draft gear is a key component in a railway train system. The stochastic feature of dry friction in the draft gear has been observed by many researchers, however, characterisation studies in this regard have not been published. This paper used a state-of-the-art laboratory testing rig to measured draft gear forces and deflection responses to sinusoidal force inputs. Measured data were then inversed into values for Coefficient of Friction (CoF). The inverse method was developed based on a friction-wedge-spring draft gear model. The results show that CoF values have a range from 0.22 to 0.47; however, the majority of values are located above 0.34. Normal distribution fitting of the CoF values show that they have a mean of 0.42 and a deviation of 0.02. Weibull distribution fitting shows that they have a scale parameter of 0.43 and a shape parameter of 22.48. The normal distribution stochastic friction was used to model a friction draft gear. A simulation was conducted, and the results show that simulations using the stochastic model can better match the measured data than using conventional deterministic friction.

Based on the field investigation and numerical simulation, the cause of severe flange wear of the original S1002 wheel profile on a Chinese metro line is analysed. An optimised wheel profile is proposed according to the rolling radius difference (RRD) for improving vehicle curving performance and mitigating wheel flange wear. A wheel wear prediction model is developed by combining the metro vehicle dynamics model considering multipoint contact with the long-term wear simulation model, and then validated with the field measurement results. The performance of the optimised wheel profile is evaluated numerically. The results indicate that the root cause of the wheel flange wear is the improper matching of wheel and rail profiles. The optimised wheel profile generally proves to perform better in terms of wheel-rail contact geometry, mechanical properties, vehicle running stability, curving negotiation and wear performance. The wheel flange thickness loss of the optimised wheel profile is decreased by 55.7% compared with that of S1002 profile.

J	Sorge, F				Sorge, Francesco			A nonlinear dynamical approach to the path correction of multi-steering articulated vehicles	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Articulated lorries; off-tracking; rearward amplification; multiple steering axles	HEAVY VEHICLES; TRACTOR	When designing articulated tractor-trailer systems, engineers should take care to contrast some undesired phenomena associated with the lateral dynamics: the path off-tracking, namely the trajectory deviation of the points of the two units compared to the midpoint of the tractor fore; the rearward amplification of the transverse acceleration. The off-tracking may lead the vehicle tail to invade the opposite direction lane or the emergency lane, whereas the rearward amplification may involve the danger of the trailer rollover. Nonetheless, the arrangement of multi-steering axle systems with the proper correlation among the steering angles may substantially cancel the off-tracking, both along a path with constant curvature and while entering or leaving the road bend. Moreover, the proper control of the increase and decrease of the steering angle during the transient phases can restrain the lateral acceleration of the towed unit. The present analysis considers several nonlinear effects of the vehicle lateral dynamics, such as large steering angles, nonlinear cornering characteristics and changes of the cornering forces because of the centrifugal effect. The goal is a practical formulation of the correlation among the steering angles to correct the vehicle run and ensure lateral stability.

J	Abroshan, M; Hajiloo, R; Hashemi, E; Khajepour, A				Abroshan, Mehdi; Hajiloo, Reza; Hashemi, Ehsan; Khajepour, Amir			Model predictive-based tractor-trailer stabilisation using differential braking with experimental verification	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Tractor-trailer vehicle; vehicle dynamics; MPC controller; stability; differential braking	STEERING CONTROL; OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; PATH TRACKING; STABILITY; VEHICLES; ENVELOPES; LIMITS; YAW	Different types of instability modes in tractor-trailer vehicles, including jackknifing and snaking, necessitate designing a fast and effective control strategy. In this paper, a model predictive controller (MPC) is developed to prevent these instability modes in a car-trailer vehicle as a specific form of tractor-trailer vehicles equipped with differential braking. The effectiveness of the control action when the differential braking is applied only to the tractor and only to the trailer is also studied comparatively. The developed MPC controller utilises an affine tyre force model, and the control actions are limited based on the capacity of the tyres. The aim of the controller is to ensure that the tractor and the trailer follow the desired yaw rate and the desired hitch angle, respectively. The controller performance is evaluated through experimental tests and simulations. Experimental tests are conducted on an all-wheel-drive electric Chevrolet Equinox and a student-built research trailer, both equipped with an independent braking module on each wheel. In the simulations, the controller is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, and an experimentally validated CarSim model of the tested tractor-trailer vehicle is employed. The results show that the designed MPC controller effectively prevents both instability modes; however, differential braking has much more capacity when it is applied to the tractor.

J	Mahalingam, I; Padmanabhan, C				Mahalingam, Ilango; Padmanabhan, Chandramouli			A novel alternate multibody model for the longitudinal and ride dynamics of a tracked vehicle	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Tracked vehicle; multibody model; Adams tracked vehicle (ATV); contact force models	SPATIAL DYNAMICS; SIMULATION; CONTACT; DESIGN	This paper presents a novel alternate multibody model for a tracked vehicle by replacing the tracks with a set of imaginary wheels. A planar multibody model with imaginary wheels replacing tracks is developed with a nonlinear contact force model for the interaction between the wheel and ground for both hard and soft terrains. The results of the proposed track model are validated with experimental data from the literature as well as with the results from a detailed track model in Adams tracked vehicle software. The paper demonstrates that replacing the tracks with imaginary wheels provides a simple yet realistic alternate model for tracks. The computational cost is reduced significantly and hence one can use this to carry out detailed vehicle performance studies before finalising a design.

The occurrence of this phenomenon makes it difficult to appropriately manage accelerating, braking or steering, due to a considerable reduction of wheel forces. In this research project, the longitudinal hydroplaning test was conducted, according to the common VDA test procedure under acceleration. Results are presented, which quantify test parameters during the measurement, such as vehicle velocity, gate distance and longitudinal tire slip ratio. The article further identifies the impact of test conditions (wheel normal load, tire inflation pressure and water depth) on the longitudinal hydroplaning performance. In addition, the respective dynamic tire footprint characteristics are determined and linked to the performance. In the course of the analysis, it is shown that the empirical equation, developed by Horne to predict the critical hydroplaning velocity of truck tires, can be applied to passenger car tires. These results contribute to enabling a better understanding of how footprint characteristics affect longitudinal hydroplaning performance under acceleration conditions.

In this new model, the buffer bias pressure characteristic is simulated accurately by discretising the real polymer buffer linearly into seven impedance force elements of the same non-linear hysteresis characteristic but different weighting coefficient, and the shear effect between them is considered by setting an additional deflection stiffness. Then a heavy-haul train dynamic model consisting of one locomotive, two wagons and three sets of coupler and buffer systems is established and validated by comparing its calculation results with test data. The simulations are carried out to investigate the influences of curve radius, locomotive and coupler structural parameters on the locomotive dynamic responses and running safety. Results indicate that the coupler rotation angles and locomotive running safety index increase gradually with the decrease in curve radius. And the elastic stiffness and free clearance of locomotive secondary lateral stops also have great influences, weakening the lateral stop constraint would cause the increase of the coupler rotation angles but the decrease of the wheel-rail forces and running safety index.

Dynamic interaction of a freight car body and a three-piece bogie during axle load increase	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Angle bogie hunting of wheel set; lozenging of bogie side frames; three-piece bogie; train speed		The article presents the results of theoretical studies of interaction process of a freight car body with a three-piece bogie, which are aimed at solving the relevant problem of increasing the permissible speeds at railways with 1520 mm track gauge under conditions of linear load increase on the wheel set axle. The purpose of the research was to propose such an approach to the study of interaction processes between rolling stock and track, taking into account the interaction model of neighbouring carriages in trains, which will allow more correctly take into account the dynamics of rolling stock and increase traffic safety. The oscillation frequencies of the body, bogie and wheel set are analysed in order to establish a possible resonance phenomenon. The article examines the longitudinal and transverse forces of pseudo-sliding (creeping) arising between the climbing wheel of the front bogie and the rails. The conducted studies can contribute to the replacement of 18-100 bogies with modernised three-piece bogies while maintaining the main most metal-consuming elements of the 18-100 model implementing some modernisation units. The results obtained will make it possible to revise the permissible vehicle speeds with an increased axle load.

A multivariate statistical representation of railway track irregularities using ARMA models	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Rail; rail-wheel interaction; random dynamics and vibrations; statistics; multibody systems		Railway track irregularities occur naturally from service operations and are characterised by deviations of the track relative to its nominal geometry. Since the dynamic behaviour of a rail vehicle depends on the geometry of the track, studying irregularities is essential for safety, comfort, and maintenance. Conventionally, an irregularity is synthesised from a univariate stochastic process, which is a suitable way to represent excitations occurring in one dimension. However, most three-dimensional analyses of rail vehicles require a multivariate description of the irregularities. Therefore, synthesising multiple variables using univariate processes neglects possible relationships among them. This work addresses track irregularities from a multivariate series perspective to model the spatial autocorrelation of each irregularity and their spatial correlation with other types of irregularities. Several multivariate models with different complexity levels are estimated from the irregularities of a 3.6-km long straight track segment. A comparison among models shows that they should be selected based on not only statistical information criteria, but also their ability to reproduce relevant physical characteristics. Finally, a case study shows that the vehicle response to irregularities that are synthesised using the proposed multivariate process matches the response to measured data better than irregularities synthesised using independent univariate processes.

The importance of equation eta = mu n(2) in dimensional analysis and scaled vehicle experiments in vehicle dynamics	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Dimensional analysis; vehicle dynamics; model-prototype similitude; dynamic similarity; scaled vehicle modelling		Dimensional analysis has been very helpful in experimentation of very large or small-scale engineering systems. A good example would be experimentation on the aircrafts and ships, which was made cost-effective and simple by dimensional analysis. The history of dimensional analysis mentioned in the introduction section of the present document includes many of such applications. Automotive industry, however, never felt the need as the price or the size of land vehicles did not make experimentation so far-fetched; therefore, there are many crash tests which every new vehicle has to go through before mass production This changed with the imminent introduction of autonomous vehicles, which brought all the risks involved in experimenting with them. Many cost-effective experimental platforms are introduced, such as QCar https://www.quanser.com/products/qcar/or laboratories, such as Scaled Autonomous Vehicles Indoor (SAVI) https://cast.tamu.edu/research/technology-demonstrator-platforms/scaled-autonomous-vehicles-indoor-tdp/. The present study will enable the results taken from such platforms to be translated to real-sized vehicles, enabling researchers to study dynamics of various vehicles. Classical vehicle equations of motion including constant velocity, accelerating bicycle model and roll model have been made dimensionless. The case of steady-state responses is also calculated in a dimensionless form. Some practical numerical examples are also mentioned as a proof of theory.

This study proposes a novel vehicle stability control paradigm, based on pre-emptive control that considers the curvature profile of the expected path ahead in the computation of the reference direct yaw moment and braking control action. The additional information allows pre-emptive trail braking control, which slows down the vehicle if the predicted speed profile based on the current torque demand is deemed incompatible with the reference trajectory ahead. Nonlinear model predictive control is used to implement the approach, in which also the steering angle and reference yaw rate provided to the internal model are varied along the prediction horizon, to account for the expected vehicle path. Two pre-emptive stability control configurations with different levels of complexity are proposed and compared with the passive vehicle, and two state-of-the-art nonlinear model predictive stability controllers, one with and one without non-pre-emptive trail braking control. The performance is assessed along obstacle avoidance tests, simulated with a high-fidelity model of an electric vehicle with in-wheel motors. Results show that the pre-emptive controllers achieve higher maximum entry speeds - up to similar to 34% and similar to 60% in high and low tyre-road friction conditions - than the formulations without preview.

While the floating slab track system remains the most effective vibration isolation measure, a large vibration reduction blind area can still be observed at low frequencies. In the present study, a general quasi-zero-stiffness vibration isolator (GQZS vibration isolator) was proposed to enhance the ultra-low frequency (< 20 Hz) vibration control capability of floating slab tracks. The dimensionless analysis was utilised to design nonlinear stiffness curves and to determine the proposed GQZS vibration isolator static mechanical performance. Analyses of the dynamic mechanical behaviours of the proposed vibration isolator were conducted based on the force transmissibility rate. Results showed that the designed stiffness curve effectively reduced force transmissibility at low frequencies. A vehicle-floating slab track-substrate coupled dynamic model was proposed considering complicated train loads, and the results were consistent with force transmissibility analyses.

Certain road geometries can induce excessive amplification in suspension response of the heavy vehicles leading to large vertical accelerations in the cargo. The cargo of interest is a modular building unit (MBU) which is a long cuboidal structure that requires to be transported from the factory to the building site. The current work deploys an experimentally validated mathematical pitch-plane model of a trailer and a road undulation (road bump) geometry for the analysis. Parameters such as suspension stiffness, damping, vehicular speed, road undulation geometry and tie-down strap strength are used to quantify the probability of vertical separation that can occur between the MBU and the trailer-bed by employing Monte-Carlo simulations. Vertical separation is converted to vertical pounding (impact) velocity and values reaching up to 1.5 ms(-1) have been found to be probable at the end of the study.

In the superconducting EDS train, the discrete layout of ground null-flux coils causes the additional electromagnetic ripples towards the bogies, making the vibration control more essential to ensure the running performance. In this work, a fourteen-degree-of-freedom dynamics model of superconducting EDS train, was established to explore the effective strategy for vibration reduction. This model uses the time domain wave of track irregularity spectrum as the input of vehicle system. MATLAB/Simulink and "Zhai's method" are both adopted to solve the vehicle dynamic model and validate the model. Using these models, the effectiveness of the proportional force and maximum force for the primary suspension was examined. The results show that the maximum force strategy has advantage over the proportional force strategy in terms of energy consumption and vibration sensitiveness. However, the electromagnetic damping control can only suppress the vibration of bogie. To achieve an overall vibration control, the "ON-OFF" sky-hook damping was further introduced to the secondary suspension to suppress the vibration of car body. We find that, the control effect is preferable with the damping value being between 5 kN center dot s/m and 10 kN center dot s/m. Therefore, the cooperative control, considering both the primary and secondary suspensions, is necessary to meet the Urban Tracked Aircushion Vehicle Standard and provide theoretical supports for the suspension design of superconducting EDS train.

Seven different strip spacings varied from 100 to 700 mm are considered. The errors in pantograph resistance between numerical simulation and wind tunnel test are within 5% in both knuckle-downstream and knuckle-upstream operating conditions. The drag and lift forces of the strip increase with the strip spacing when the train's running speed is 350 km/h. By considering the two strips individually, it is interesting to find that the lift force on the first strip tends to be stable as the spacing reaches up to 600 mm in both operating conditions, whereas the lift force on the second strip increases continuously with the spacing in the whole range of 100-700 mm. Furthermore, the aerodynamic coefficient of the strip is a nearly constant value at different running speeds, which increases with the strip spacing, suggesting that the relationship between the aerodynamic forces and the spacing of strips obtained in the current study can be extended to any speed level in the range of 200-350 km/h.

Simulation can be used to estimate the critical speed below which sustained hunting will not occur given certain parameters of the wagon, track and lading. This paper investigates the hunting of an unloaded freight wagon fitted with three-piece bogies which utilise friction wedges for damping and have friction at many interfaces. Several methods of analysis are compared including simulation on track with irregularities. The novel use of different initial conditions at each bogie is shown to excite different types of hunting at a given speed. Only one of these was excited by the common method of running over a discrete lateral track irregularity.

Tube model predictive control for an autonomous race car	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article; Early Access						Robust control; model predictive control; tube MPC; autonomous driving; race car	NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; STEERING CONTROL; ROBUST; OPTIMIZATION; INVARIANCE	Nonlinear effects and external disturbances can severely impact the control of an autonomous race car at the handling limits. State-of-the-art approaches do not take these uncertainties explicitly into account in the design process and are therefore prone to failure. To overcome this limitation, we present a robust control design based on tube model predictive control (TMPC). It is based on a simplified friction limited point-mass model and an additive disturbance for the lateral and longitudinal dynamics. Instead of nominal predictions, it leverages an approximate tube of reachable sets over the prediction horizon to guarantee constraint satisfaction. The resulting optimisation problem can be posed in the form of a standard quadratic programme by tightening the input and state constraints. The computational burden is therefore the same as in the nominal case. We benchmark our controller on a Hardware-in-the-Loop testbench with a nonlinear dual-track model and a combined Pacejka tyre model. The results demonstrate that the TMPC controller reduces the constraint violations while achieving comparable lap-times in contrast to an MPC controller and an infinite time LQR controller. It manages to apply caution when needed while maintaining a similar level of performance and is therefore considered to be superior in practical applications.

Like train bridges, train tracks demonstrate comparable track-bridge (TB) motion dynamics. Using these coupling dynamics, are the high-speed train-track-bridge (HSTTB) system designs sensitive to those parameters? This research incorporates a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) technique developed for simulating the dynamic reactions of the coupled TB system when faced with simultaneous NF lateral and vertical ground motions (GMs). For the first time, data from the pre-commissioning field testing of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed train are utilized to validate the Train-Track-Bridge Dynamic Analysis (TTBDA) test. As a matter of fact, the current research has concentrated on the running safety of the high-speed train's operations, as well as the possible derailment mechanism of the high-speed train, in light of the far-field (FF) earthquakes. This analysis reveals that the NF GMs in the bridge structure's seismic reactivity are considerable. Many high-speed train derailments are due to frequent wheel displacement, elevated wheels, and significant lateral motion.

The polygonization mechanism has not been fully understood yet, and this work discusses one possible mechanism through several experiments. Firstly, a field test for the CRH3 high-speed train with polygonal wheels is carried out. It is found that the vibration in vertical takes major responsibility, and there are several resonance bands for the train-track system. Another field test shows that the rail is sensitive to the polygonisation characteristic frequency, but the wheel axle is not. Then the rail local vibration modes are analyzed by the operational deflection shape (ODS) test in the laboratory. A loaded bogie is fixed on the tested track to simulate the real working conditions. The result shows that the frequency of one local mode is 591 Hz, which is a typical wheel polygonisation frequency. Besides, the wheel-rail contact point is not on the vibration node of this local mode. Thus, the resonance of this local rail mode can be one possible mechanism for the high-order wheel polygonisation.

J	He, R; Yan, YZ; Hu, DH				He, Ren; Yan, Yanzhi; Hu, Donghai			Optimised adaptive control methodology for mode transition of hybrid electric vehicle based on the dynamic characteristics analysis	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Hybrid electric vehicle; mode transition; clutch engagement; dynamic characteristics; security domain; adaptive control	MAGNET SYNCHRONOUS MOTOR; ENERGY MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY	Mode transition plays an important role in the operation of hybrid electric vehicles. The clutch is a key actuator for mode transition, but friction resulting from its use makes it difficult to achieve seamless mode transition. Moreover, as is usual in an electromechanical coupling system, the hybrid powertrain may exhibit complex dynamic behaviours as operating parameters change during mode transition. This paper considered changes in the clutch friction coefficient, and established a mathematical model of the hybrid powertrain in a parallel-series hybrid electric vehicle (PSHEV) during mode transition. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion and bifurcation theory are introduced to analyse the influence of speed difference on the dynamic characteristics of the hybrid powertrain, and the corresponding instability threshold were given. Furthermore, an optimised adaptive control methodology was proposed to control the dynamic behaviours, and tests on PSHEV were carried out. The results show that the variations of speed difference may lead to the occurrence of Fold and Hopf bifurcations, and that once the speed difference reaches the instability threshold, it may cause the system to enter a chaotic state and exhibit random oscillation. The proposed control methodology can effectively expand the security domain and suppress the oscillation to improve smoothness of mode transition.

Application of low-power energy harvesting solutions in the railway field: a review	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Review						Energy harvesting; railway; vibration harvester; thermal harvester; wind harvester; solar harvester	REGENERATIVE BRAKING; VIBRATION; DESIGN; SYSTEM; ALGORITHM; SENSORS	In order to ensure safety and reliability of railway transportation the interest in monitoring systems is constantly increasing. These devices include sensors and electronic components, which need electric power supply for their proper working. However not all railway lines and vehicles are provided with electric power, furthermore, it can be complex to provide energy to sensors by cables in some location of the vehicle. The demand of a widespread distributed electrical energy can be fulfilled by energy harvesting techniques from primary sources. This paper analyses the different concepts of energy harvesters proposed in literature for the railway field, both for on board and wayside applications. The harvesters are classified according to the source from which energy is harvested and for each type of harvester advantages and disadvantages are critically discussed. The proposed review highlights the most promising solutions regarding energy harvesting in order to support future researches concerning this topic.

Comparing Renault's Multi-Sense sport and comfort modes during on-road naturalistic driving	VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS			English	Article						Multi-mode driving; chassis control; Renault Multi-Sense; real-world validation; four-wheel steering; variable damping	SUSPENSION SYSTEM; STEERING-SYSTEM; SIMULATOR	Several modern vehicles provide the option to select a driving mode. However, the literature contains no empirical studies that investigate how driving modes affect the vehicle's dynamic behaviour in regular on-road driving. We examined for which CAN-bus signals the differences between Renault's Multi-Sense (R) comfort and sport modes are most apparent. We gathered data on a 26.3 km route containing a rural and highway section. A single person drove the route four times in comfort mode and four times in sport mode. By statistically analysing and ordering 887 CAN-bus signals, we found strong differences between the two modes for rear-wheel angle, engine torque, longitudinal acceleration, and vertical motion. Parameter identification of a quarter car model identified a 3.5 times higher damping coefficient for the sport mode compared to the comfort mode. Due to four wheel steering, compared to the comfort mode, the sport mode yielded a higher lateral acceleration and yaw rate for a given steering wheel angle and driving speed. In conclusion, this study provides quantitative insight into the extent to which the Multi-Sense driving modes impact the vehicle's lateral, longitudinal, and vertical dynamic behaviour. The results and the analysis methods help guide future driving mode designs.
