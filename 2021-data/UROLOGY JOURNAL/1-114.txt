Symptom Resolution and Recurrence Outcomes after Partial Versus Total Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy: 13 years of Experience with Medium-Long Term Follow up	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						adrenalectomy; laparoscopy; partial; adrenal sparing surgery; cortical sparing surgery; recurrence	PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA; MANAGEMENT	Purpose: Partial adrenalectomy (PA) is an emerging modality typically performed for the treatment of hereditary and sporadic bilateral tumors, to reduce the risk of adrenal failure. In this study, we evaluated the recurrence and functional outcomes after partial and total adrenalectomy (TA). Materials and methods: From March 2005 to July 2018, 284 patients with functional tumor or > 5 cm adrenal mass underwent clipless and sutureless laparoscopic partial or total adrenalectomy (PLA and TLA). Patients with a pathological diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, Cushing or Conn's disease and more than two year follow up were included in this study. Pre-operative and operative variables were collected retrospectively and functional outcomes and recurrence were gathered prospectively. Results: One hundred forty patients (mean age: 43 +/- 5.1years) were included in the study. PLA and TLA were performed for pheochromocytoma (total n=78; PLA=12 (15%), TLA=66 (85%)), Cushing syndrome (toal n=17; PLA = 4 (24%), TLA = 13 (76%)), and Conn's disease (total n=45; PLA=7 (16%), TLA=38 (84%)). In pheochromocytoma patients, improvement of hypertension, palpitation, and headache was not different between patients who underwent PLA versus TLA (all P > 0.05). Two recurrences were observed in patients with pheochromocytoma who had undergone TLA. In patients with Cushing disease, central obesity, fascial plethora, and hypertension were improved in all patients six months after treatment, muscle weakness was improved one year after surgery, and acne and hyperpigmentation only improved two years after surgery. The length of time for resolution of symptoms was not different in patients who underwent PLA versus TLA. In Conn's disease hypertension was resolved in all patients and no patient required potassium supplements post-operatively. In follow up no recurrence was observed in patients with a pathological diagnosis of Cushing or Conn's disease. Conclusion: In our experience, PLA can provide excellent control of the symptoms parallel with TLA and with no statistically significant difference in recurrence making PLA an attractive option in patients with an adrenal mass.

Delayed post-op bleeding may herald pseudo aneurysm (PA) or arteriovenous fistula (AVF) necessitating costly and inconsistently available angioembolization, or prolonged hospitalization. The goal of this study is to identify criteria that may predict response to conservative therapy, for delayed bleeding from post PCNL intrarenal vascular lesions. Materials and methods: We reviewed all data on patients re-admitted for post PCNL gross hematuria at our high volume center between 2011 and 2016. Perioperative findings, factors related to the stone and management details, were subjected to multifactorial analysis. Logistic regression for multivariable analysis and ROC curves to find thresholds predicting mandatory angioembolization. Results: Of 4403 PCNLs, 83 (1.9%) with delayed bleeding were diagnosed with intrarenal vascular lesions: Arteriovenous fistulas in 54 (AVF, 65%) and pseudoaneurysm in 29 (PA, 35%). Overall 49 (59%) responded to conservative management but 34 (41%) eventually required angioembolization. On multivariable analysis, predictive factors for poor response to conservative treatment were requiring transfusion beyond initial stabilization, pseudoaneurysm, history of open renal surgery, longer interval-to-second-admission, and size of vascular lesion. The proposed POPVESL score (short for Post PNL Vascular Embolization selection) when below 11, correctly predicts success of conservative management with 81.6% sensitivity & 100% specificity. Conclusion: Our findings including the proposed POPVESL score have the potential for clinical application and enhancing practical guidelines on the management of post-PCNL bleeding.

This study aimed to further evaluate the response and progression-free time (PFT) of individual metastatic organs. Materials and Methods: Data from mRCC patients, who were treated with sunitinib between January 2008 to December 2018, were retrospectively reviewed. Individual metastatic organs were assessed separately by The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Results: We evaluated response heterogeneity and PFT as characteristics of 281 individual organs affected by mRCC in 213 patients. The objective response rates in these organs were 72.7% in pancreas, 63.7% in spleen, 14.3% in adrenal glands, 13.5% in bone and soft tissue, 11.6% in lymph nodes, 11.6% in lungs, and 9.1% in liver. The median PFT was 15.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.7-27.7 months) for adrenal glands, 13.2 months (95% CI 3.5-22.9 months) for bone and soft tissue, 9.0 months (95% CI 7.6-10.4 months) for lymph nodes, 8.6 months (95% CI 6.3-10.9 months) for lungs, and 5.2 months (95% CI 2.9-7.5 months) for liver. Median PFT was not reached in pancreas and spleen, but was > 22.8 months and > 20.6 months, respectively. Conclusion: Our results indicated that organs affected by metastasis may have individual responses to sunitinib treatment. The pancreas and spleen may have the best responses, and liver may have the worst response. Further research is needed to verify these findings.

These procedures are often associated with complications requiring surgical intervention. The aim of our retrospective study was to evaluate the occurrence of major complications and identify risk factors. Materials and Methods: Between 2010 and 2018 ninety-one patients have been implanted with sling (22; 24.2%) or AUS (69; 75.8%) in our department. The cases where surgical revision was needed were examined regarding the etiology (mechanical failure (MF), urethral erosion (UE), urethral atrophy (UA), surgical site infection (SSI), combined reasons (COMB) and analyzed, using 16 possible perioperative risk factors. Results: Surgical intervention was carried out by 19 / 91 (20.9%) patients. (In 16 / 69 cases after AUS (23.1%), 3 / 13 after slings (23%)). The indication was in 6 (31.6%) cases MF, in 3 (15.8 %) COMB, in 4 (21.1%) UE, in 5 (26.3 %) SSI, in 1 (5.2%) UA. The type of reoperation was either explantation (12 / 19), system replacement (6 / 19), or cuff replacement (1 /19). Regarding the surgical intervention requiring complications only preoperative bacteriuria (P =.006) and postoperative surgical site oedema (P =.002) proved to be independent predictive factors. Conclusion: Preoperative bacteriuria and surgical site oedema seemed to be good predictors for obligate surgical revision. Patients with AUS were more prone to have major complications. In most cases it was mechanical failure, infection or erosion. By reducing the frequency of these risk factors we might be able to decrease the amount of complications.

J	Jing, P; Zou, JQ				Jing, Peng; Zou, Jiaqiong			Effects of Delta Np63 Gene Down-expression on Invasion of Bladder Carcinoma Cells in Vitro	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Delta Np63; ZO-1; bladder cancer; invasion	P63 EXPRESSION; TIGHT JUNCTIONS; PROLIFERATION; INVASIVENESS; PHENOTYPE; SNAIL; P53	Purpose: This work aims to investigate the effects of Delta Np63 gene down-expression on invasion of bladder carcinoma cells in vitro. Materials and Methods: Bladder carcinoma cell lines UM-UC-3 and 5637 were cultured. The expression plasmids encoding Delta Np63 were constructed and transfected into UM-UC-3 and 5637 cells. The migration and adhesion of cells were detected. The expressions of Delta Np63 and invasion-related zonula occludens protein-1 (ZO-1) in cells were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot analysis. Confocal microscopy was used to observe the location of ZO-1 in cells. Results: Results showed that the down-expression of Delta Np63 reduced the migration of UM-UC-3 and 5637 cells, decreased the heterogeneity adhesion, and increased homogeneous adhesion. After transfection with Delta Np63, the ZO-1 expression in cell membrane and cell cytoplasm was inhibited, also the ZO-1 mRNA and protein levels in cells were significantly decreased. Conclusion: This study indicates that Delta Np63 gene down-expression can reduce the invasion of bladder carcinoma cells in vitro.

Materials and methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted by searching Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CBM, CNKI and VIP databases up to June, 2019. Summarized risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the strength of association between 5ARIs and depression. Subgroup analyses were performed according to population, 5ARI types, degree of depression, and publication date. Registered in PROSPERO under number CRD42018096147. Results A total of 6 clinical studies with 265672 participants were included in our meta-analysis. The application of 5ARIs could significantly increase the risk of depression based on both pooled unadjusted (95% CI: 1.28-2.78, RR = 1.89, P=.001) and multivariable adjusted RRs (95% CI: 1.01-1.17, RR = 1.09, P=.03). In subgroup analyses, dutasteride was associated with depression significantly (95% CI: 1.37-1.70, RR = 1.53, P<.001), while finasteride was not. As to the degree of depression, 5ARIs mainly caused mild depression (95% CI: 1.91-2.33, RR = 2.11, P<.001), instead of moderate or severe depression. Conclusion We concluded that 5ARIs could potentially increase the risk of depression. Clinicians need to carefully consider the use of 5ARIs for benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia patients, especially those exhibiting risk factors for depression or those who have a previous history of depression. More studies with larger sample size and comprehensive study design are needed necessarily to further verify our outcomes.

J	Merder, E; Ariman, A; Altunrende, F				Merder, Erkan; Ariman, Ahmet; Altunrende, Fatih			A Modified Partin Table to Better Predict Extracapsular Extension in Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						extracapsular extension; localized prostate cancer; partin table; PSA; PSAD; radical prostatectomy	RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; GLEASON SCORE; EXTRAPROSTATIC EXTENSION; PATHOLOGICAL STAGE; ANTIGEN DENSITY; GRADING SYSTEM; MARGIN STATUS; BIOPSY CORES; RISK; DISEASE	Purpose: Prediction of extracapsular extension (ECE) before radical prostatectomy in clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa) is very important for clinical practice. ECE affects our decision on treatment strategy. The aim of this study is to identify the predictors of ECE, determine cut-off values, and compare them with the accuracy of Partin Table parameters to improve tumor staging in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: 374 patients with clinically localized PCa who underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) were included in this study. Gleason Score (GS), age, digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate specific antigen (PSA), prostate specific antigen density (PSAD), free PSA, Free/Total PSA, prostate volume (PV), number of cores involved, tumor length, and tumor percentage in maximum involved core in biopsy were investigated. Results: PSAD, tumor percentage, and tumor length are predictive factors of ECE. The cut-off values of PSA, PSAD, maximum tumor length, and maximum tumor percentages in predicting ECE are: > 8.90 ng/mL, > 0.26 ng/mL2, >5mm, and >50%, respectively. The cut-off values for Partin extraprostatic extension (EPE) and organ confined (OC) disease are >29% and <= 64%, respectively. Conclusion: Partin tables could better predict extracapsular extension in clinically localized PCa if they include PSAD, tumor percentage, and tumor length. The cut-off values of these predictive factors can be beneficial in treatment strategies and in the decisions of lymphadenectomy and nerve-sparing surgery at radical prostatectomy.

Materials and Methods: We reviewed the charts of patients (n=6) who underwent suprapubic percutaneous assisted cystoscopic excision for posterior urethral fibroepithelial polyp from 2014 to 2019. Their data were retrospectively reviewed in terms of clinical features, diagnostic methods, endoscopic approaches, and postoperative results. Results: The 6 patients, the mean age of 3 years (4 months-6 years), with a solitary polyp of posterior urethra diagnosed and removed by suprapubic percutaneous assisted cystoscopic excision in five years. The most common complaint was urinary tract infection (n:3). The urethral polyps were diagnosed by ultrasound and cystoscopy. There was no intraoperative or postoperative complication except for one patient with bleeding from the trocar site. All of the specimens after histopathology examinations showed fibroepithelial polyps and no recurrence was seen. Conclusion: Posterior urethral polyps may cause obstructive effect in the urinary tract. The treatment should be performed with the least possible invasive method without injuring urethral wall. We believe that suprapubic percutaneous assisted cystoscopic resection, described by us is an easy, reliable and effective method for treatment procedure of posterior fibroepithelial urethral polyps.

J	Issi, Y				Issi, Yasar			Non-Invasive Stent Removal after Ureteroneocystostomy in Pediatric Patients: Long-Term Results	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						catheter; vesico-ureteral reflux; stent; pediatrics	URETERAL REIMPLANTATION; SYMPTOMS; COMBINATION; MONOTHERAPY; MANAGEMENT; TAMSULOSIN	Purpose: Among the more serious problems in urological interventions among the pediatric age group is the requirement of general anesthesia. The advantages of removing a double-J stent (DJS) without anesthesia in ureteroneocystostomy (UNC) operations among children were investigated in this study. Patients and Methods: In all, 25 patients who underwent UNC surgery between November 2016 and November 2018 were retrospectively divided into two groups according to the method used for the removal of the DJS. In Group 1, the stent was tied to the urethral catheter by a suture and retrieved postoperatively on the fourth day without anesthesia and cystoscopy. In Group 2, we inserted the stent according to the classical method with no suturing to the catheter and removed it 3 to 4 weeks after the first operation, with cystoscopy under anesthesia. Results: A total of 16 girls and 9 boys were included in the study. The mean age was 4.3 and 6.3 years in groups 1 and 2, respectively. We did not observe statistically significant difference between the groups in long-term renal function or hydronephrosis regression. Conclusion: We consider that the removal of a stent placed in pediatric intravesical UNC operations without anesthesia and cystoscopy is less invasive and affords safety and long-term results comparable to the standard method.

Clitoral EPCs are extremely uncommon without prior history of genital surgery, trauma, circumcision, or piercing. Surgical removal with special care to avoid compromising neurovascular bundle of the clitoris is the preferred treatment. To our best knowledge, only three cases of adult female clitoral EPC without history of genital surgery, female circumcision, or medications including oral or implantable contraceptives have been reported. Herein, we describe three cases of primary EPC of the clitoris, their management, unique histopathology report, safe surgical approach, and their follow course.

J	Verit, A; Verit, FF				Verit, Ayhan; Verit, Fatma Ferda			Can Short Anogenital Distance Cause Chronic Prostatitis?	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Letter						Chronic prostatitis; Chronic pelvic pain syndromes (CP/CPPS); Anogenital distance; etiology of CP; treatment of CP	PAIN; EXPOSURE	Chronic prostatitis/Chronic pelvic pain syndromes (CP/CPPS) are a widespread pathology with unknown etiology without a proved treatment algorithm. Neurologic, endocrine and immune systems, and oxidative stress, infections are ranked in the physiopathology. Anogenital distance (AGD) as a marker for the degree of antenatal exposure of androgens that link to some disorders of androgen-sensitive tissues especially of urogenital system. In this study, we aimed a construct a hypothesis that improper development of perineum and pelvic bottom due to the insufficient embryologic androgen exposure, which can be detected by reduced AGD, can form histologic/clinic CP in adulthood through the physical forces that resulted in stretched prostate via chronic hypoxia induced oxidative stress and failed immune mechanisms. AGD, unlike the previous published ones, suggested as a real physical scale to detect narrowed pelvic bottom other than an endocrine related biomarker.

The present study was conducted to assess the potential therapeutic and adverse effects of Abo-BTXA or Dysport for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Materials and Methods: Twenty-two out of 52 women diagnosed with IC/BPS who were refractory or had a low response to oral treatments of IC/BPS after 6 months, were included in the study. The end-point was O'Leary-Sant Score (OSS) including "symptoms" and "problem" indexes (ICSI and ICPI respectively) assessment after 1,3and 6 months after Abo-BTXA injection. Each patient underwent cystoscopy and immediately after hydrodistention received intratrigonal injections of 300 IU of Abo-BTXA (Dysport (R)) in 30 sites. The effect and side effects of this treatment over time have been investigated. Complications including high post void residual urine (PVR), bladder rupture, and urinary tract infections (UTI) were also assessed. Results: The mean age of patients was 46.2 +/- 13.7 years and the median OSS was 27.8 +/- 5.8.: After a single injection ICSI, ICPI, and total OSS significantly reduced in 1, 3, and 6 months follow up; rate of decreased total OSS was 39.5%, 36%, 18%, respectively. Its effect lasted up to six months and started to decrease after 1 month (p-value < 0.05). Complications included urinary retention (PVR > 200ml), bladder rupture, and UTI in 13.5%, 4.3%, and 18% of the patients, respectively. Conclusion: Intravesical injection of 300IU Abo-BTX(Dysport) could be a useful approach for the treatment of patients with refractory IC/BPS in a period of six months.

Methods: The standard double-back translation method, provided by the previous studies were utilized by three professional linguists to translate the English version of the NIH-CPSI to Persian, and a group of 10 urologists further reviewed and translated questionnaire. The questionnaire was then presented to the sample study, comprised of 60 men with CP/CPPS and 60 controls with adverse urological history, and the collected data was analyzed through IBM-SPSS software to test its validity, evaluative, and discriminatory power, psychometric qualities and internal consistency. Results: A total of 80 subjects (42 CP/CPPS patients and 38 healthy controls) were considered eligible for this study. The total Persian NIH-CPSI scores and each subdomain showed significant difference (P < 0.001) between the two study groups, indicating a satisfactory discriminant validity for the index. Psychometric analysis established the index to benefit from a high internal consistency. The translation was also considered by both the subjects and the physicians to be easily comprehensible. Conclusion: The Persian NIH-CPSI is a reliable and valid instrument for evaluating CP/CPPS symptoms in general population, while also benefitting from high discriminatory power, and can be utilized with ease in both clinical practice and laboratory studies.

Our aim was to analyze whether secondary repair will pose additional challenges during robotic pyeloplasty compared with the primary pyeloplasty. Material and Methods: 114 patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty (RALP) between February 2015 and August 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into; primary and secondary repair. The demographics, intraoperative parameters, postoperative parameters, and success rate of these two groups were collected and compared. Primary RALP data were further stratified into those who previously underwent ipsilateral endourological surgeries (IES) at the obstruction site and those who did not, to evaluate the effect of IES has on the outcome of RALP. Success was defined as symptomatic and radiological relief. Results: Of the 114 patients, five complicated cases (three horseshoe kidneys, one duplicated system, and one retrocaval ureter) were excluded from the comparison. The remaining 96 primary and 13 secondary repairs were compared. Intraoperative and postoperative parameters showed no significant difference between the two groups. The results of 99 patients (87 vs. 12 in primary vs. secondary, respectively) were available after 27.5 months mean follow-up. The overall success was 92%, 8 patients failed (5 vs. 3 in primary vs. secondary, respectively) and required further surgical interventions. Conclusion: Though surgically challenging with increased recurrence rates according to the literature we reviewed. However, our data failed to show any significant difference between the primary and redo RALP perhaps due to the smaller size in the redo RALP group.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted for a total of 115 patients affected by solitary NMIBC, with a diameter < 3 cm, who were submitted to operation between March 2013 to May 2017. The patients were divided according to the operative method applied (pin-ERBT, TURBT, and HoLRBT groups, respectively). The 2-year recurrence rate was compared among the three groups, and multivariate Cox hazard model analysis was applied to analyze the influencing factor(s) for postoperative recurrence. Results: The 2-year recurrence rate was 10.0% in ERBT, 38.5% in TURBT and 40.0% in HoLRBT group, with a significant difference (P = 0.014). According to the Cox hazard model analysis, age (HR = 1.058, 95% CI: 1.019 similar to 1.098, P = 0.003), operative method (HR = 2.974,6.508, 95% CI: 0.862 similar to 10.255,1.657 similar to 25.566, P = 0.023), smoking (HR=2.399, 95% CI: 1.147 similar to 5.017, P = 0.020), and pathological grade (HR = 2.012,95% CI: 1.279 similar to 3.165, P = 0.002) were risk factors for postoperative recurrence of bladder cancer. Conclusion: Pin-ERBT can prominently decrease the postoperative recurrence rate of solitary NMIBC with a diameter < 3 cm.

Materials and Methods: We performed a preoperative 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in 51 patients with prostate cancer (PCa), who were scheduled for an RP operation between January 2014 and June 2016 in our clinic. The correlation between the RP pathology and the results of the 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan was investigated. Results: When the 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan results were evaluated according to the risk groups, intraprostatic activity was found in 5 of 12 patients (41.7%) in the low-risk group, 15 of 19 patients in the intermediate risk group (78.9%), and 90% patients in the high-risk group. The 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy were calculated as 58.2%, 75.3%, 84.4%, 44%, and 63%, respectively for intraprostatic tumor localization; 68.4%, 75%, 61.9%, 80%, and %72.6%, respectively for extracapsular extension; 63.6%, 92.3%, 70%, 90%, and 86%, respectively for seminal vesicle involvement; 50%, 100%, 100%, 88%, and 89.3%, respectively for LN metastasis. Conclusion: The 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan accurately demonstrates intraprostatic tumor localization in high-risk group and presence of seminal vesicle involvement, which can help to accurately detect the target lesion before prostate biopsy. In addition, with its high sensitivity and specificity values, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT is a valuable imaging method for the assessment of LN metastasis in intermediate- and high-risk groups and also provides accurate nodal staging before RP.

Materials and Methods: Semen was collected from 30 oligospermic men, who referred to infertility clinic of Beasat Hospital in Sanandaj, Iran. The samples of each individual were divided into 8 equal parts: 1. control group before freezing; 2. incubated with L-carnitine; 3. incubated with coenzyme Q10; 4. incubated with the combination of L-carnitine + CoQ10; 5. control freezing group; 6. the experimental freezing group with L-carnitine; 7. the experimental freezing group with coenzyme Q10 and 8. the experimental freezing with the combination of L-c + CoQ10. Sperm motility was assessed by WET MOUNT method. DNA fragmentation was evaluated by SCD (Sperm Chromatin Desperation), ROS, was evaluated by quantitative fluorescence reaction, and chromatin deficiency was determined by chromatin staining (CMA3). Results: Antioxidant treatments, significantly reduced the number of ROS + in the pre and post freezing groups. Significant improvement was seen in the sperm motility of class B in the pre freezing groups with L-carnitine. Antioxidants also reduced the percentage of DNA fragmentation and protamine deficiency in pre-and post-freezing. Conclusion: Addition of Coq10 and L-carnitine to human sperm medium significantly reduced the number of ROS. This reduction in ROS reduced sperm damage during cryopreservation.

Materials and Methods: We enrolled 384 newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) patients and 152 controls all of whom were >50 years into our prospective cross-sectional observational study. The first group contained patients receiving metformin only, the second group patients were taking a mixture of medications, including metformin plus other oral anti-diabetics, and the third was the control group. Before beginning treatment, body mass indices (BMI) of all cases were obtained. Prostate volumes were evaluated using transabdominal ultrasonography at the sixth and twelfth months. Insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), insulin-rich growth factor (IGF-1), PSA, free PSA, and total testosterone levels were measured. Results: The differences in BMI between the first and third groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). There were no statistical differences among the groups in terms of prostate volumes (P > 0.05). The differences between the groups for insulin, HbA1C, ISI, IGF-1 (somatomedin), PSA, free PSA, and total testosterone levels were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Free PSA and total testosterone levels in groups 1 and 2 were not statistically different at the beginning of treatment and the sixth month (p > 0.05), but within groups 1 and 2, only PSA levels were different at the start of the study until completion. No differences were seen in the third group. Conclusion: Metformin appears to cause a decrease in PSA levels. The mechanism and any effects on prostate tissue will be studied in future randomized, prospective studies.

A transverse testicular ectopia (TTE) with cryptorchidism may be very rarely associated to PMDS. Assuming that mullerian remnants have a very low malignant degeneration potential if compared to the malignancy risk of an undescended and not relocated testis, we describe a simplified surgical technique of orchiopexy that avoids an extensive anatomical dissection, in this way minimizing the risk of losing the deferential blood supply to the testis.

This study aimed at evaluating the possible anticancer effect of saffron stigma aqueous extract on human prostate cancer (PC3) and mouse fibroblast cells (L929) as non-cancerous control cells. Materials and Methods: Saffron stigma aqueous extract at concentrations of 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1600 and 3200 mu g/mL were prepared. PC3 and L929 cells were incubated with different concentrations of saffron extracts in different time intervals (24, 48, 72, 96 and 144 hours). MTT assay was used for each cell line to investigate the cytotoxic effect of saffron. Morphological alterations were also observed under light inverted microscope. Results: In fibroblast cell line after 24 hours, Saffron extract did not affect significantly the normal cells and they were intact in morphologic view. After 96 hours in the cells with highest concentration (1600 mu g/mL), cell death and cellular form changes as well as severe granulation was observed. In prostate cell line after 24 hours, the only changes were observed in cells with the concentration of 1600 mu g/mL. The cells were granulated and the form of the cells were spherule. After 72 hours, in group with the concentration of 1600 mu g/mL, severe granulation was observed and the cell count decreased and some cells were dead. Conclusion: Saffron aqueous extract has an in vitro inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human prostate cell and mouse L929 cells which is dose-dependent.

The renal lipoma is an extremely rare renal mesenchymal tumor, typically originating from renal capsule and it is usually presented as well circumscribed homogenous fat containing mass. Angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common benign mesenchymal renal tumor which is composed of mature epithelioid cells. The renal AML usually presented as exophytic, non-infiltrative, and fat contain tumor. The well differentiated renal retroperitoneal liposarcoma and lipoma seem to be misdiagnosed by exophytic renal angiomyolipoma but the renal AML usually arises from renal parenchyma with characteristic images. A 37-year-old woman came to our clinic with rapid growth renal mass and pain. The spiral abdominopelvic computed tomography scan (CT-scan) showed well-circumscribed hypoheterodense fat-containing mass near to middle pole of the right kidney with minimal fat stranding without neovascularity and cortical defect. The Patient underwent off-clamping laparoscopic resection of renal mass with pre-operative impression: liposarcoma versus lipoma of the kidney. The cross-section of the surgical specimen revealed irregular lobulated fatty tissue with hemorrhagic streaks. Definite diagnosis was made by immunohistochemistry study. Spindle cells and epithelioid cells are diffusely and strongly positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin. The perivascular cells and epithelioid cells are positive for HMB-45 and Melanin. The immunostaining pattern was compatible with angiomyolipoma that originated from renal capsule. In our experience, a rapid growing mass that is accompanied by pain draws the attention to malignant process. The renal AML rarely arises from renal capsule without characteristic images so having high doubt may lead to proper pre-operative diagnosis.

Assessment of long-term follow-up for a homogeneous population with hypospadias is difficult and there has consequently been a paucity of publications in this regard. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was carried out to compile cases of distal hypospadias operated at our center between 1990 and 1999 according to the MAGPI procedure. Four parameters were evaluated based on four validated questionnaires: Health-related quality of life (SF-36), Genital self-perception (PPS), Self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), and Erectile function (IIEF). Results: A total of 77 patients who had undergone MAGPI surgery for hypospadias during the specified period were selected. Sufficient clinical data were available for 51 patients and only 15 of these patients were included, after a median follow-up of 22 years (20-26). Their outcomes were compared with those for a population of 15 matched circumcised men and 15 matched uncircumcised men. No significant difference was found between the patients and the control groups in terms of the score for quality of life (p = .29). There were, however, significant differences in the scores for self-perception of the penile cosmetic appearance (13.3 vs. 15.8; p < .01), self-esteem (30.6 vs. 35.8; p < .01), and erectile function (31.4 vs. 33.7; p = .04) between the patients and the controls. Lower self-esteem correlated with poor genital self-perception (r = .92). Conclusion: This study confirms that adult patients operated for distal hypospadias have poor genital self -perception. This poor genital perception correlated with lower self-esteem.

During fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), the surgeon and the patient are exposed to X-ray and its harmful effects. This study aimed to assess the reduction of the radiation dose received by surgeons and patients after using a new shielding method. Materials and Methods: In this study, the dose of radiation exposure by the surgeon and patient during PCNL under fluoroscopic procedure with conventional shielding methods was compared to a new shielding method designed by the researcher. For this purpose, shields and lead cones with a thickness of 0.5 mm were used. Also, to evaluate the dose of radiation received by surgeons and patients in different parts of the body, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were used. Results: By using the new shielding method, a 37 +/- 2% reduction was found in the dose exposure as compared to the conventional shielding method. The maximum reduction in radiation dose was specified to the surgeon's hands, while the lowest reduction in radiation dose was related to the surgeon's thyroid gland. The maximum and minimum reductions in radiation exposure for patients were specified to patients' feet and chest respectively. Conclusion: There is a significant difference between the total dose received by the surgeons and the patients following the use of the new shielding method and the standard shielding method. The new shielding method can reduce 37 +/- 2% of the x-ray received by the patient and the surgeon during fluoroscopy-guided PCNL.

Materials and Methods: Clinical records of the patients who had surgery during first six weeks of life for UPJO between June 2009 and June 2014 were analysed retrospectively. Results: In this period, twenty-six dismembered pyeloplasties were performed in twenty-four patients on mean operation age of 27.3 +/- 10.2 days (range 8-42 days). On the first postnatal ultrasound all twenty-six renal units had SFU-4 hydronephrosis. Mean preoperative and postoperative anterior-posterior pelvic diameter and parenchymal thickness were 33.1 +/- 8.9mm (range 14-49mm), 3.2 +/- 1mm (range 1-4,6mm) and 14.7 +/- 6.6mm (range 6-27mm) and 7.8 +/- 1.9mm (range 3.0-10.4mm), respectively. The differences between preoperative and postoperative parenchymal thickness and anterior-posterior pelvic diameter were statistically significant (P. 0.0001). Preoperative MAG3 dynamic renal scintigraphy showed obstructive pattern on the diuretic renogram in 26 units. Mean preoperative and postoperative differential renal function on dynamic renal scintigraphy of the affected renal units were 46 +/- 15 and 44 +/- 15, respectively. Postoperative drainage was normal on dynamic renal scintigraphy in 25 (96.2%) of the 26 units, redo-pyeloplasty was needed in only one unit (3.8%). Conclusion: In conclusion, patient selection and timing of surgery are very important in the protection of renal function in newborn with UPJO. In our opinion, if there is indication for surgery, early surgical intervention should not postpone in this period. Surgical treatment of UPJO during first six weeks of life is safe and effective.

Materials and methods: Patients with BPH and moderate to severe LUTS (N = 76) who underwent RezUm treatment from December 2019 to July 2020 were included in the prospective study. Prior to the procedure, they completed the IPSS and OABv8 questionnaires and underwent uroflowmetry, transrectal ultrasound of the prostate, and PSA sampling. The parameters before and 3 months after the procedure were compared and statistically evaluated. Results: The study protocol was completed by 92% of patients (N = 70). We observed a significant increase in Qmax (median 17.7 vs. 8.8 mL/s, P < .001), Qave (9 vs. 4.5 mL/s, P = .001) and voided volume (241 vs. 171 mL, P < .001) and a significant reduction in post-void residual (average 17.5 vs. 67.7 mL), prostate volume (39.3 vs. 62.3 mL) and total PSA (median 1.9 vs. 2.5 ng/mL, resp. P values < .001). There was also a significant decrease in OABv8 score (average 7.6 vs. 16.6, P < .001) and IPSS QoL (1.6 vs. 4.0, P = .037). The improvement in the IPSS score was apparent, yet statistically insignificant (6.8 vs. 16, P = .079). Conclusion: Water vapor therapy is an effective and safe method of BPH/LUTS treatment in the short-term.

Materials and Methods: Over 3 years, women 20-80 years old with symptoms suggestive of uUTI (Urinary Tract Infection Symptoms Assessment symptom score, ,UTISA > 3) and bacteriuria (bacterial count >= 100/uL) were enrolled. After informed consent, patients took cephalexin 500mg 4 times/day for 7 days. The voided urine specimens were classified into rods or cocci/mixed group automatically through the built-in software of the UF1000i. Patients were followed up with UTISA on the 3rd day after treatment and returned to the clinic on the 7th day and followed for additional UTISA and urine analysis. Symptom and laboratory improvement were defined as UTISA < 4 and bacterial count < 100/uL, respectively, on the 7th day. Results: Of 99 women (age: 49.91 +/- 15.32 years) eligible for analysis, 80 were classified as having urine that contained rods and 19 as cocci/mixed. Symptom improvement was observed in 62 women in the rods group and 11 women in the cocci/mixed group (p = 0.08). Laboratory improvement was noted in 64 women in the rods group and 10 women in the cocci/mixed group (p = 0.01). On day 7, treatment success with both symptom and laboratory improvement was more observed in rods than in cocci/mixed group (61.3% vs. 26.3%, p < 0.01). Conclusion: The automatic urine particle analyzer can pre-estimate the treatment response of antibiotics in women with uUTI.

Extravesical Common Sheath Ureteral Reimplantation Versus Intravesical Techniques for Refluxing	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						vesicoureteral reflux; duplex systems; ureteral reimplantation	VESICOURETERAL REFLUX; DUPLICATION; DETRUSORRHAPHY; MANAGEMENT; INJECTION	Purpose: Retrospective comparative study of the efficacy of extravesical non-dismembered common sheath ure-teral reimplantation (ECSR) versus intravesical common sheath ureteral reimplantation (ICSR) techniques for the correction of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in complete duplex systems. Material and Methods: Between 2010 and 2019, ECSR was performed in 38 children (8 bilaterally), and the mean ages at presentation and at surgery were 31 and 57 months, respectively. The ICSR technique was performed in 25 units (25 patients). Voiding cystography and ultrasound of the kidney and bladder were performed 3 and 12 months postoperatively. We analyzed the surgical outcomes for both groups. Results: The mean follow-up times for the ECSR and ICSR groups were 15 and 18 months, respectively. The success rate of the ECSR group was 93.5% at 3 months, improving to 95.7% at an average of one year; the rate of the ICSR group was 96% at 3 months and was the same after one year, with no significant difference between the two groups (p = .66). Postoperative complications were compared in the ECSR and ICSR groups: transient con-tralateral VUR was seen in 5 renal units versus 4, de novo hydronephrosis was seen in 3 units versus 2, and UTIs were observed in 3 patients versus 4. Conclusion: Both (ECSR) and (ICSR) surgeries are highly successful for the correction of VUR in uncomplicated complete duplex systems. The results of the extravesical approach are comparable with those of the intravesical technique with less morbidity and a shorter hospital stay. Thus, ECSR is our preferred technique when open surgical repair is indicated. ICSR should be reserved for complicated duplex systems necessitating concomitant reconstructive surgery.

However, improvement of bacterial detection methods has debunked this assumption. Recent studies have shown that the bladder contains microbiomes, which are not detectable under standard conditions. In this review, we aimed to present an overview of the published literature regarding the relationship between urinary microbiota and functional disorders of the genitourinary system. Methods: We searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane library and Scopus to identify RCTs published, with MeSH and free keywords including microbiota, bladder pain syndrome, prostatitis, kidney stone disease, and bladder cancer until September 2020. Randomized controlled trials investigating microbiome and lower urinary tract symptoms were included. Non-randomized trials, cross-over trials and pooled studies were excluded. The articles were critically appraised by two reviewers. Conclusion: The urine microbiome is a newly introduced concept, which has attracted the attention of medical researchers. Since its recent introduction, researchers have conducted many fruitful studies on this phenomenon, changing our perspective toward the role of bacteria in the urinary tract and our perception of the genitourinary system health. Result: A deeper understanding of the urinary microbiome can help us to develop more efficient methods for restoring the microbiota to a healthy composition and providing symptom relief. Modification of the urinary microbiome without antibiotic use can be a possible venue for future research.

This study aimed to review the conservative management of urinary lithiasis and its outcomes in renal transplanted patients. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis of the scientific literature were performed in the Medline, Scopus, and Embase databases. Inclusion criteria were studies which include patients with kidney stones in transplanted kidney no matter de-novo or donated stones and use conservative treatment for all or part of their patients. Exclusion criteria were bladder & ureteral stones, full text unavailable, conference paper. (from January 1st, 1980, to the 19th May 2020). The results of included studies, in the final analysis, were combined using a random-effect model and using metaprop method prevalence and 95% CI of renal stone were reported. Results A total of 8 studies (14988 transplant patients) met the inclusion criteria for the final analysis. A total of 195 patients suffered from renal stone and the prevalence of renal stone was 1.3% (95% CI: 0.89% - 1.7%). The mean age of these patients was 43 years. analysis, the prevalence of conservative treatment in 195 patients was 35% (95% CI: 19%-51%). The mean stone size ranged from 0.29 cm to 1 cm. Three studies reported a stone-free rate of %100. Except for two studies that did not report complications, other studies reported zero percent. Conclusion More than one-third of nephrolithiasis were conservatively managed in transplanted patients.

UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						urethral stricture; PRP; urethral fibrosis; urethral inflammation; urethral healing	VISION INTERNAL URETHROTOMY; MITOMYCIN-C; RECURRENCE	Purpose: To determine the efficacy of instillation frequency and submucosal injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) after urethral trauma to prevent urethral inflammation and spongiofibrosis. Materials and Methods: Sixty-five rats were used in the study; 50 rats were randomized into 5 groups with 10 rats in each group and 15 rats were allocated for PRP preparation. The urethras of all rats were traumatized with a pediatric urethrotome knife at 6 and 12 o'clock positions, except in the sham group. Group 1 was the sham group and had only urethral catheterization daily for 15 days, Group 2 was given 0.9% saline (physiologic saline [(UI+PS]) once a day after urethral injury (UI+ PS), Group 3 was injected with PRP submucosally after urethral injury, Group 4 was given PRP once a day as intraurethral instillation using a 22 Ga catheter sheath with urethral injury, and Group 5 was given PRP twice a day as intraurethral instillation using a 22 Ga catheter sheath with urethral injury. Each administration of PRP was administered as 300 million platelets/150 microliters. On day 15, the penises of the rats were degloved to perform penectomy. Histopathologic evaluation was made for spongiofibrosis, inflammation, and congestion in vascular structures. Results: When the sham group, UI+PS, UI+PRPx1, UI+PRPx2 and UI+PRPs groups are compared in total, there were significant differences identified for parameters other than edema. When the UI+PS, UI+PRPx1, UI+PRPx2 and UI+PRPs groups are compared, the UI+PS group was observed to have significantly more inflammation (mucosal inf. 2.42 +/- 0.53) and spongiofibrosis (2.42 +/- 0.53). All the PRP groups were identified to have significantly less mucosal inflammation (UI+PRPs 1 +/- 0, UI + PRPx1; 1.4 +/- 0.51, PRPx2; 1.33 +/- 0.5) and spongiofibrosis (UI+PRPs; 1.57 +/- 0.53, PRPx1; 1.2 +/- 0.42, PRPx2; 1.55 +/- 0.52). The group with the lowest spongiofibrosis was the PRPx1 group. Conclusion: This study showed that PRP significantly reduced mucosal inflammation and spongiofibrosis, independent of the administration route, when applied to the urethra after urethral trauma.

Materials and Methods: A hundred sets of core biopsies of postoperative specimens (renal masses) have been performed. Three core biopsies of the intact specimen had been performed once the kidney with the tumor, or the tumor alone were resected. The urologist aimed to obtain two cores from the peripheral sides of the tumor and one core from its center. The surgical specimen was evaluated by a single pathologist, whereas biopsy samples were referred to three independent pathologists who were blinded to the final results of the renal mass biopsy. Results: Nondiagnostic biopsy rates ranged from 13% to 22%. Sensitivity and specificity ranged 83-97% and 97-99% by excluding nondiagnostic results. The concordance between assessment of surgical specimen and biopsy in the Fuhrman grading system ranged 36.5-77.0%, respectively. Interobserver agreement between the three pathologists was substantial or moderate, depending on the tumor subtype. The Krippendorff's alpha coefficient, calculated by excluding the nondiagnostic results, was 0.28 (moderate agreement) for the Fuhrman grading system. Conclusion: The agreement regarding grading of biopsies between three pathologists ranged from moderate to substantial. Therefore, a team of dedicated uropathologists should be engaged in final diagnosis of renal mass biopsy rather than single one before implementing the proper treatment.

The aim of this study was to investigate the reliability and validity of the Persian version of the pelvic pain and urinary/frequency (PUF) questionnaire in Iranian women with CPP. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 50 females with CPP referred to the urology clinic of Kerman University of Medical Sciences from 2018 to 2019. Initially, the PUF questionnaire was translated into Persian and then back translated into English. The face validity of the tool was evaluated by being tested on 50 patients who had different literacy levels to ensure its understandability and acceptability by patients. The construct validity was evaluated through both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The internal consistency was also analyzed by determining Cronbach's alpha coefficient and test-retest method. Results: The Persian version of the questionnaire was compatible with the original English version. The Kisser sampling adequacy index was calculated on the data before extracting the factors indicating good factor accessibility of the questionnaire statements. The construct validity of the questionnaire was confirmed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The internal consistency parameters were also acceptable. Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the whole questionnaire, as well as the coefficients of the "signs/symptoms" and "unpleasant feelings" domains were 77%, 74%, and 78%, respectively. Conclusion: The developed Persian version of the PUF questionnaire retrieved a good validity and reliability.

During cystourethroscopy, we tried to find the orifice of ureterocele, passed a guide wire and introduce an 8 Fr ureteroscope in to the ureterocele orifice, going up to the renal pelvis as under vision dilatation of ureterocele meatus. Two Double-J stent were inserted and remained for six weeks to keep the meatus dilated. Adverse effect of endoscopic management was decreased due to minimal anatomic changes. Patients' symptoms were relieved and no evidence of new onset vesico-ureteral reflux and obstruction were seen after up to one-year follow-up. Endoscopic meatal dilatation of stenotic ureterocele in adult patients is safe and effective thus, trying to find the orifice of ureterocele is suggested.

Materials and Methods: Five electronic databases (Web of Science, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, SCOPUS and the Cochrane Library) were searched from inception until March 2020. Studies were included if they focused on the relationship between PSA and GSU analyzed in multivariable analysis. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were utilized. Quality of included studies was appraised utilizing the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) for case-control studies. The publication bias was evaluated by funnel plot and Egger's test. Results: Our search yielded 19 studies with high quality including 42193 patients. GSU was found in 28.2% of patients. Higher PSA level was associated with a significant increased risk of GSU (pooled OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.10-1.18; P < .05; = 92%). For the definition of upgrading from bGS <= 6 to pGS >= 7, the odds of upgrading with higher PSA level as opposed to lower PSA level was 1.12 (95% CI: 1.11-1.14; P < .05; 1 2 = 13%), while the odds of upgrading with other definitions were 1.11 (95% CI: 1.05-1.18; P < .05; I-2 - 89%). Conclusion: Patients with high level of serum PSA are at high risk of undergoing pathologic upgrading at prosta-tectomy. Combined with other risk factors, PSA prompts risk reclassification and improve confidence of urologists in management decisions for optimal therapy. Nevertheless, further robust studies are necessitated to confirm these results.

Materials and Methods: Eighty-eight patients with primary non-muscle invasive bladder cancer were allocated randomly in two groups who were treated with HoLRBT or TURBT. The intraoperative and postoperative characteristics and complications of the HoLRBT and TURBT groups were compared. The data of operation time, obturator nerve reflex rate, bladder perforation, bladder irrigation, catheterization time, hospital stay, and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 months recurrence free survivals were considered in two groups. Results: There was no significant difference in operative duration among the two groups. Compared with the TURBT group, HoLRBT group had fewer intraoperative and postoperative complications, including obturator nerve reflex, transient hematuria, and postoperative bladder irritation. There were no significant differences among the two groups in the transfusion rate and occurrence of urethral strictures. Patients in the HoLRBT group had less catheterization and hospitalization time in comparison to those in the TURBT group. There were no significant differences in the overall recurrence rate among the TURBT and HoLRBT groups. Conclusion: HoLRBT can be regarded as a safe and efficient method with several advantages over TURBT. HoLRBT can be used as an alternative procedure for TURBT in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.

Materials and Methods: This study included 165 patients who underwent RARP. Overall, 98 patients underwent RARP using our modified detrusorrhaphy and intrafascial nerve-sparing techniques (group 1) and 67 underwent standard RARP (group 2). Continence and potency rates were assessed at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after RARP. Oncologic outcomes comprised positive surgical margins (PSMs) and biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate. Results: The continence rates were 61.2% and 6.0%, 72.5% and 11.9%, 79.6% and 20.9%, 91.8% and 58.2%, and 97.9% and 74.6% at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months in group 1 and 2, respectively. The potency rates were 66.3% and 11.9%, 78.6% and 38.8%, 85.7% and 50.8%, 92.9% and 70.2%, and 95.9% and 79.1% at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months in group 1 and 2, respectively. Overall postoperative complication rates (< 10%) were similar between the groups. The PSMs rate was 17.4% and 16.4% in the two groups. The rate of PSMs in the cohort of patients with stage pT2 disease decreased to 13.6% and 12.5% in groups 1 and 2, respectively. BCR rate was 5.1% and 6.0% in groups 1 and 2, respectively.

Therefore, a meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the surgical safety for BPH patients on AC or AP therapy was performed. Materials and Methods: The protocol for the review is available on PROSPERO (CRD42018105800). A literature search was performed by using MEDLINE, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane library, and Embase. Summarized odds ratios (OR), mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the difference in outcomes. Results: We identified 13 trials with a total of 3767 patients. An intragroup significant difference was found in bleeding complications and blood transfusions when undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). For laser surgery, the intragroup significant difference was found in the result of blood transfusion. Bridging therapy would not cause a higher risk of bleeding complications and blood transfusion during the perioperative period. Besides, no difference existed in operation time, catheterization time, hospitalization, and thromboembolic events. Conclusion: Patients with BPH on perioperative AC/AP therapy would have a risk of postoperative hemorrhage after TURP or laser treatments. To reduce the risk of hemorrhage, bridging therapy could be a good choice.

Currently, diagnosis of VUR depends on invasive imaging studies, with a high radiologic burden. Therefore, different biomarkers have been introduced for the evaluation of these patients. The objective of this study was to identify alteration of urinary interleukins (ILs) excretion in children with primary VUR and renal parenchymal damage, for further clinical application. Materials and methods: Urinary concentrations of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-8 were evaluated in 34 children with VUR (cases) and 36 without VUR (control), during 2018-2019. Urinary concentrations of IL-1, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 were measured, using polyclonal antibody ELISA kit, and standardized to urine creatinine (Cr). Patients with infectious or inflammatory disorders, urolithiasis, immune deficiency, acute or chronic kidney disease, and secondary VUR were excluded from the study. Results: Mean age of cases (36.00 +/- 27.66) had no significant difference with the control (32.86 +/- 29.31) group (p=0.44). The majority of patients had moderate VUR (58.8%), followed by severe (35.3%) and mild (5.9%) grades. Urinary concentration of all ILs/Cr were significantly higher in patients with VUR, compared with those without VUR. There was no significant correlation between urine ILs/Cr with age, gender, serum electrolytes, urine specific gravity, renal ultrasound, laterality or severity of VUR, and DMSA renal scan. All urine ILs/Cr had acceptable sensitivity and accuracy for workup of children with primary VUR. Conclusion: Urine IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-8/Cr were sensitive and accurate additionary screening biomarkers in children with primary VUR.

It accounts for about 4% of cancer-related mortality in men. Several genetic polymorphisms in different genes have been identified that alter the risk of this kind of malignancy. Materials and methods: We used the random forest (RF) algorithm for prediction of prostate cancer risk in Iranian population using 13 different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four genes (ANRIL, HOTAIR, IL-6 and IL-8). The samples were divided into a training set (n=320) and a test set (n=80) to evaluate the generalization power for training algorithm. For hyper-parameters tuning, we used randomized search with 5-fold cross -validation for the following hyper-parameters: (1) Number of trees or estimators in the forest (set from 3 to 500); (2) The maximum number of leaf nodes (set from 2 to 32); (3) The maximum number of features used for the best split (set from 5 to 13); and (4) Using bootstrap samples in the trees building (True or False). Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score in both training and test sets were reported. Results: The most important SNP was ANRIL-rs1333048: A/A (Gini index= 0.096) followed by ANRIL-rs10757278: G/G (Gini index= 0.059). Training Dataset Outcomes were as follow: Accuracy: 0.896, Sensitivity: 0.85, Specificity: 0.944 and F1 Score: 0.891. Test Dataset Outcomes were as follow: Accuracy: 0.787, Sensitivity: 0.775, Specificity: 0.800 and F1 Score: 0.784. The AUC Scores were 0.966 and 0.841 for training and test datasets, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed panels of SNPs can predict risk of prostate cancer in Iranian population with appropriate accuracy.

Thus, a meta-analysis was performed to determine whether marital status can influence the prognosis in patients with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: Literature search of the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify eligible studies published before April 2020. Multivariate adjusted risk estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted and calculated using the random effects model. Results: A total of 11 observational studies comprising 1,457,799 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer were identified. Results indicated that unmarried status (separated, divorced, widowed or never married) was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, HR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.30-1.50; P<.001; I2 = 92.2%) compared with married status, especially for divorced and never-married patients. Similarly, being unmarried had an elevated risk of cancer-specific mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.17-1.41; P<.001; I2 = 82.5%) in patients with prostate cancer. A significant difference was also observed between unmarried status and shorter overall survival (HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.20-1.56; P <.001; I-2 = 94.5%). Conclusion: Results demonstrated that unmarried status is associated with a worse prognosis regarding mortality and survival in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, particularly in divorced and never-married patients. Hence, further research should explore the potential mechanisms which can benefit the development of novel, more personalized management methods for unmarried patients with prostate cancer.

Since the efficacy of urodynamic studies (UDS) in evaluating these conditions is subject to controversy, this study aimed to assess the accordance between urodynamic findings and LUTS and to determine the importance of UDS in women with POP. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on women over 18 years with symptomatic POP referred to the female urology clinic of Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran, during 2017-2018. Patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study with informed consent. The Pelvic Floor Disability Index (PFDI-20) was completed for each patient. Pelvic examination was performed using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System (POPQ). Subsequently, multi-channel UDS was performed, and the findings were analyzed in SPSS 20, using Chi-square or Fisher's test. Results: A total of 200 women with symptomatic POP were included in the study. Stress, urge, and mixed urinary incontinence showed significant accordance with the urodynamic findings (urodynamic stress incontinence and/or detrusor overactivity). However, there was no significant relationship between urinary voiding LUTS and urodynamic findings. Conclusion: UDS should be performed for selective patients with POP. According to the results of the present study, UDS can help us provide consultation for POP patients with voiding LUTS. However, in POP patients with urinary incontinence, this test cannot provide further information and should be performed based on the patient's condition.

However, the results were controversial. To derive a more precise estimation of this association, a meta-analysis was performed. Methods: The eligible literatures were identified through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, SciELO, WanFang, and CNKI databases up to July 01, 2019. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to calculate the strength of the association. Results: A total of 23 case-control studies with 795 ARR cases and 1,562 non-AR controls were selected. Pooled data revealed that there was no significant association between TGF-beta 1 codon 10 polymorphism and an increased risk of ARR in the overall population (C vs. T: OR=0.908, 95% CI 0.750-1.099, p = 0.322; CT vs. TT: OR=1.074, 95% CI 0.869-1.328, p = 0.507; CC vs. TT: OR=0.509, 95% CI=0.738-1.253, p = 0.770; CC+CT vs. TT: OR = 0.917, 95% CI 0.756-1.112, p = 0.376, and CC vs. CT+TT: OR=0.995, 95% CI 0.809-1.223, p = 0.959). Moreover, stratified analysis revealed no significant association between the TGF-beta 1 rs1982073 polymorphism and ARR risk by ethnicity and cases type (recipient and donor). Conclusion: The current meta-analysis demonstrated that the TGF-beta 1 rs1982073 polymorphism was not significantly associated with increased risk of ARR. However, studies with a larger number of subjects among different ethnic groups are needed to further validate the results.

As well, the prevalence of diabetes, as one of the causes of sexual dysfunction, is rising in many countries. Due to the failure of common therapies in some patients with sexual dysfunction, it is necessary to develop an effective alternative treatment, such as stem cell therapy, for this problem. Materials and Methods: In this randomized single-blinded clinical trial, 20 diabetic patients with erectile dysfunction, who were resistant to common treatments, were selected and divided into two groups of intervention and control (n=10 per group). Autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were extracted from oral mucosa and then infused via intracavernosal injection (50-60 x10(6) cells) to the participants of the intervention group. Normal saline was injected in the control group. The patients were followed up with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF5) questionnaire, as well as color Doppler duplex ultrasound. Peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), and resistance index (RI) were determined three and six months after the interventions. Results: The mean IIEF5 scores in the intervention group were 7.2 +/- 2.1, 9.2 +/- 3.4, and 10.6 +/- 4.7 before, three months, and six months after the injection, respectively, showing a significant ascending trend (P = 0.01). Comparing the intervention and control groups, there was a significant difference in the IIEF5 score change during six months after the injection (P = 0.02). Regarding the PSV and RI of penis vessels, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. However, these parameters showed upward and improving trends in the intervention group. Conclusion: Intracavernosal injection of stem cells improved sexual function and PSV and RI indices of penile arteries in diabetic patients.

Materials and Methods: All 51 patients, who were getting treatment for the last 5 years, participated in the study. 31 of 51 patients underwent transrectal sonography (TRUSG)-assisted prostate biopsy because of prostate adenocarcinoma as diagnosed with elevated PSA levels and histopathological examination. The remaining 20 patients comprised the control group. The control group included patients with benign prostate hyperplasia based on pathological examination. Results: It was found that there was strong positive epithelial staining in 74.2% of patients with prostate cancer while in 5% of controls, indicating a statistically significant difference (P < .001). It was also found that the rate of strong positive endothelial staining was 77.4% in the patient group whereas 5% in the control group (P < .001). Also, the rate of strong positive stromal staining was 64.5% in the patient group while 5% in the control group (P < .001). Conclusion: We found that tissue endocan expression level was statistically significantly higher in patients with prostate cancer compared to those with benign prostate hyperplasia by using an immunohistochemical method.

We evaluated chronic kidney disease risk factors in these children. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of children with posterior urethral valve and included those younger than 18 years old who underwent valve ablation and bladder neck incision at our institution. We recorded patient demographics, presenting symptoms, laboratory and radiographic data. Our primary outcome was chronic kidney disease de-fined as stage 3 chronic kidney disease or higher. Renal outcome risk factors such as preoperative vesicoureteral reflux and serum creatinine, age at diagnosis, adjuvant urinary diversion were analyzed. Results: A total of 110 patients met our inclusion criteria. The median age at diagnosis was 10.4 months (range 14 days to 12 years). Prenatal diagnosis in 72.7% was the most common presenta-tion. Mean follow-up duration was 3 years and 12 (10.9%) patients progressed to chronic kidney disease. Preoperative serum creatinine greater than 1 mg/dL was the only factor associated with progression to chronic kidney disease. Conclusion: In our group of children with posterior urethral valve ablation and bladder neck incision, initial creatinine value of greater than 1 mg/dL is more probably associated with renal impairment while; vesicoureteral reflux, age at diagnosis, presenting symptoms, and adjuvant uri-nary diversion were not significant prognostic factors. Further randomized controlled evaluations are required to analyze the effects of concurrent valve ablation and bladder neck incision on renal outcome.

Materials and Methods: The data of 93 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and had preoperative mp-MRI were examined. Age and pre-operative Prostate-Specific Antigen values were retrospectively collected from patient files. The pathology specimens were examined again and post-operative ISUP grade group, other pathological findings (seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement, and extraprostatic extension), pre-operative mpMRI were re-examined and PIRADS score, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, neurovascular bundle invasion, lymph node involvement, and ADC values were recorded. Results: 151 (92,07%) of 164 lesions detected in mpMRI were histopathologically correlated. 80% of patients with seminal vesicle invasion (P < 0.001), 28.8% of patients with extracapsular extension (P < 0.052) and 42.9% of patients with lymph node involvement (P =.001) in mpMRI were histopathologically correlated. A significant relationship was found between PIRADS scores and ISUP grade groups (P < 0.001). There was a negative correlation between ADC values and ISUP grade groups (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study showed that the lesions detected by mpMRI showed a high histopathological correlation.

Materials and Methods: From May 2017 to April 2019, 121 patients who underwent a prostate biopsy were enrolled. All biopsy needle tips were sent for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Patients were divided into positive and negative culture groups. Perioperative data were recorded and compared between the two groups. The culture time and susceptibility of febrile patients were analyzed. Blood cultures were conducted for all patients who ex-perienced fever after biopsy. The time and results of the needle and blood cultures were recoded for descriptive analysis. Results: There were 59 (48.8%) positive needle cultures. Other than fever (p = 0.023), there were no statistical significances in clinical data between the two groups. Fever occurred in eight patients, and seven febrile patients had positive needle cultures, six of whom had positive blood cultures. These six needle and blood cultures were consistent with the susceptibility test results. As compared to the waiting time for blood cultures, target antibiotics were administered at an average of 48.0 h earlier based on needle cultures. None of the patients with positive an -aerobic cultures developed a fever, while all eight febrile patients had negative anaerobic cultures. Conclusion: Fevers developed at statistically significant higher rate among those who had positive needle cultures. Needle and blood cultures were consistent with the susceptibility test results. Needle cultures can help us adminis-ter target antibiotics earlier to febrile patients without the need to wait for blood cultures.

Materials and Methods: The pathological data of 116 patients who underwent surgery with clear cell renal cell carcinoma admitted from May 2010 to October 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent a CT scan of the abdomen including an unenhanced and three-phase (arterial, nephrographic and excretory) post contrast series. Thorough gross examination and histological sections were used to determine the integrity of the pseudo capsule by two uropathologists. The consistency between pathological findings and CT imaging were evaluated by Kappa consistency test. Results: The mean diameter of tumor was 3.0cm, range (2.6 +/- 0.8) cm. On CT the pseudocapsule can present with one of the three following feathers:1) A regular and distinct halo; 2) lobulated clear margins;3) blurred margins. On histopathology, complete psuedocapsule was found in 85 tumors, incomplete psuedocapsule in 25 and no psuedocapsule was found in 6 tumors; CT scan findings demonstrated a regular halo in 82 tumors, lobulated clear margins in 26 and blurred margins in 8 tumors(Kappa = 0.833, P = 0.000). Conclusion: Most small renal cell tumors have an obvious psuedocapsule. Preoperative determination of the psuedocapsule's integrity is particularly important. CT scan can reliably evaluate the tumor margins and demonstrate the psuedocapsule when present. The imaging results are well correlated with the pathologic findings.

Materials and Methods: Data for patients who underwent modified LG surgery between January 2006 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed from the hospital data-recording system and patients under the age of 18 years were included in the study. After exclusion criteria, 55 patients in total were included in advanced analysis. The patients were grouped as <= 12 months and >12 months. Demographic characteristics, operative, and postoperative follow-up data were comparatively analyzed. Results: The mean +/- SD (range) of age was 10.4 +/- 2.8 (6-12) and 41.4 +/- 18.5 (13-96) months in the <= 12 months and >12 months groups, respectively. Mean operation time and hospitalization time were not significant between the groups. Mean follow-up times were 39.5 +/- 14.1 and 38.4 +/- 13.2 months, in the <= 12 months and >12 months groups, respectively. There was no difference in terms of complications between the groups and all of the complications in both groups were in grade 1 category according to the Modified Clavien complication classification. One (6.6%) patient in the <= 12 months group and 3 (7.5%) patients in the >12 months group had late (>30 days) febrile UTI, but none of them had a recurrence of VUR. Febrile infection did not recur during the follow-up period in these patients. While recurrent VUR was not seen in any patient in the <= 12 months group (success: 100%), it was observed in 2 (5%) patients in the >12 months group (success rate: 95%) (p = 0.38). Conclusion: The open LG ureteral reimplantation technique is an effective procedure for the treatment of unilateral primary VUR in children both under 12 months and over 12 months of age with minor morbidity.

We investigated different cultural systems for proliferation of SSCs derived from obstructive azoospermic patients. Materials and Methods: Testicular cells were obtained from men with obstructive azoospermia. After enzymatic digestion process, cells were assigned to various groups: culture of SSCs in the dish without cover (control group), co-culture of SSCs with infertile Sertoli cells (I), co-culture of SSCs with fertile Sertoli cells (II), culture of SSCs on nanofiber (covered with laminin) (III), culture of testicular cell suspension (IV). Then cells were cultured and colony formation, gene-specific methylation (by MSP), quantitative genes expression of pluripotency (Nanog, C-Myc, Oct-4) and specific germ cell (Integrin alpha 6, Integrin beta 1, PLZF) genes were evaluated in five different culture systems. Results: Our findings indicate a significant increase in the number and diameter of colonies in IV group in compare to control group and other groups. Expression of germ specific genes in IV group were significantly increased (P <= 0.05) and levels of expression of pluripotency genes were significantly decreased in this group (P <= 0.05) compared with other groups. Gene-specific pattern of methylation of examined genes showed no changes in culture systems during the culture era.

Single umbilical stoma for bilateral ureterostomy (SUSBU) may be a choice, in this study we reviewed the outcomes of SUSBU in seventeen patients who underwent radical cystectomy. Methods and Materials: This was a case-series study conducted from April 2016 to Dec 2017. Seventeen male patients with confirmed PT2 bladder urothelial carcinoma who were not suitable for performing conduit or orthotopic urinary diversion, including those with high-risk patients underwent single umbilical stoma for bilateral ureterostomy after radical cystectomy. All patients were prospectively followed up for 24 months +/- 2 months, this study was done in a teaching center mainly by senior residents. Results: The mean age of patients was 68.6 +/- 6.41 years. The mean length of operation time was 176.7 +/- 15.1 minutes (from intubation to extubation from anesthesia). Sixteen patients were diagnosed with PT2 and one patient had a PT4 diagnosis. The decrease in hemoglobin level after surgery was 1.72 mg/dl +/- 0.35 and creatinine increased by 0.15 +/- 0.05 mg/dl. None of our patients had oliguria. One case developed constipation and no gas passing, with the suspicion of obstruction, underwent abdominal exploration, however, no obstruction or urine leakage was found and the patient was treated conservatively. One patient developed a fever during admission, in which atelectasis was identified as the cause. One patient underwent a second operation because of fascia dehiscence. Conclusion: It seems that this technique is suitable for high-risk patients with acceptable operating time, surgical complications, and fast recovery after the operation and one ureterostomy bag instead of two one's comparing to bilateral cutaneous ureterostomy.

Materials and Methods: From April 2017 to March 2019, we retrospectively reviewed 45 boys with severe phimosis (Kikiros retractability grade 4 or 5) who presented with phimosis-related complications. During the first year of the study period, methylprednisolone aceponate (MPA, Advantan (R), potent topical steroid) was administered in 24 boys. Hydrocortisone butyrate (HCB, Bandel (R), moderately potent topical steroid) was administered in 21 boys in the subsequent period. Topical steroids were administered for 4-8 weeks in all patients. Success of the therapy was determined by two conditions at 3 months after therapy: achieving Kikiros grade 3 and less with disappearance of symptoms. Results: Of 45 boys, 35 (77.8%) achieved success of the therapy. Mean age was 46.64 +/- 22.42 months. Recurrence of phimosis with clinical complications was confirmed in three of 35 patients with initial success (8.6%) during the follow-up period. All boys with recurrence showed remission after additional topical steroid therapy. Success rate of the MPA group was higher than that of the HCB group (91.7% and 61.9% respectively, P = .029). Side effects associated with the topical steroid application were not observed in all children. Conclusion: Topical steroid application is an effective and safe procedure as first-line treatment in symptomatic boys with severe phimosis. Moreover, the potency of topical steroids for the treatment of phimosis is considered a factor affecting the success rate.

According to the correlation of anxiety disorder and overactive bladder, this study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and complications of duloxetine (SNRI) as a medication in the treatment of overactive bladder in female patients. We were interested to know the probable therapeutic effect and side effects of duloxetine in overactive bladder. Materials and Methods: In this single-blinded interventional randomized clinical trial, 60 female patients with idiopathic overactive bladder (hyperreflexia) referred to the urology clinic, were divided into two groups as pilots. The first group was treated by 10mg/daily solifenacin and the second group received 20mg/daily duloxetine. The patients were evaluated by the ICIQ-OAB Questionnaire before and after a one-month follow-up period. The in-tervention primary outcomes were evaluated by the patient's presentation of the frequency, nocturia, urgency, urge urinary incontinence and the drugs side effects as secondary outcomes were checked. Results: Sixty women with confirmed overactive bladder disease were evaluated. Solifenacin and duloxetine had the same effect on the treatment of overactive bladder (p value = 0.148). The clinical symptoms were obviously relieved in both groups after treatment. Side effects were insignificantly more common in the solifenacin group (p value > 0.05). However, the different frequency of blurred vision in the two groups was statistically significant (p value = 0.04). The most common complication in the solifenacin and duloxetine groups was anxiety. Conclusion: The results showed that solifenacin and duloxetine improved overactive bladder symptoms. Accord-ing to this evaluation, duloxetine can be a suitable alternative option for overactive bladder treatment, due to the acceptable therapeutic effect and side effects.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analysed the treatment data of patients with 2-4 cm renal calculi from June 2010 to June 2017. The data included 217 cases of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL), 441 cases of retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and 217 cases of single-access percutaneous nephrolithotomy combined with flexible nephroscopy (PNCFN). The collected data were analyzed. Results: A total of 875 cases were studied, with an average age of 42.35 +/- 10.29 years. Group PNCFN showed the highest stone-free rates (SFRs)(73.7 vs 66.7 vs 80.2, P = .00), best patient satisfaction (89.84 vs 87.23 vs 92.29, P = .00). The length of stay was shorter in the RIRS group relative to the other two groups (5.22 vs 5.65 vs 3.72, P = .00). Haemoglobin decrease (> 10 g/L) was higher in group PNL than that in group RIRS and group PNCFN (P = .012). Hospitalization fees (RMB) were Increased in group PNCFN compared with that in group PNL and group RIRS (34563.45 vs 21334.69 vs 33343.16, P = .000). Treatment protocols of PNL decreased from 17.51% to 9.22%, those for RIRS from 5.22% to 17.69%, peaking at 2012, PNCFN from 8.29% to 15.67% showed a rapid growth trend. Conclusion: The percutaneous nephrolithotomy combined with flexible nephroscopy treatment on renal calculi of 2-4 cm was associated with higher stone-free rates and better patient satisfaction than RIRS and PNL.

J	Morriss, S; Zargar, H; Dias, BH				Morriss, Samuel; Zargar, Homayoun; Dias, Brendan Hermenigildo			Management of the Distal Ureter During Nephroureterectomy for Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma: A Comprehensive Review of Literature	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Review						nephroureterectomy; ureteral neoplasms; carcinoma; transitional cell	BLADDER CUFF EXCISION; LAPAROSCOPIC RADICAL NEPHROURETERECTOMY; ROBOT-ASSISTED NEPHROURETERECTOMY; SINGLE-SITE NEPHROURETERECTOMY; TRANSITIONAL-CELL CARCINOMA; ONCOLOGIC OUTCOMES; INTRAVESICAL RECURRENCE; RETROPERITONEOSCOPIC NEPHROURETERECTOMY; INVASIVE NEPHROURETERECTOMY; PERIOPERATIVE OUTCOMES	Purpose: Radical open nephroureterectomy (ONU) with bladder cuff excision (BCE) is the traditional gold standard approach for management of high-risk non-metastatic upper tract urothelial cancer. ONU involves two separate procedures; the nephrectomy and distal ureterectomy, with each of these parts being able to be performed with an open or minimally-invasive approach. Multiple approaches have been described for the resection of the distal ureter and bladder cuff after mobilization of the kidney and upper ureter. Materials and Methods: A Medline search of the literature including relevant articles up to March, 2020 was performed. Search terms included "nephroureterectomy", "upper tract urothelial carcinoma", "upper urinary tract carcinoma OR UTUC", "open OR conventional OR ONU OR conventional", "robotic-assisted nephroureterectomy OR RANU", "laparoscop* OR LNU OR LRNU" and "minimally-invasive nephroureterectomy". Original articles, case series and review articles were included. Results: There are no randomised studies. Various techniques have been described to manage the distal ureter during nephroureterectomy. This review provides an overview of these techniques. The perioperative and oncological outcomes following open versus endoscopic techniques and minimally invasive techniques have been described. Although endoscopic approaches have more favourable perioperative outcomes, this comes at the expense of increased risk of tumour spillage and recurrence compared to the traditional open approaches. Minimally-invasive techniques (laparoscopic and robotic-assisted NU) largely have superior perioperative outcomes versus their open NU counterparts, with comparable oncological outcomes. Conclusion: Current non-randomised evidence is open to selection bias and is insufficient to support or refute endoscopic management of the distal ureter as an alternative to open bladder cuff excision. The optimal approach to nephroureterectomy and management of the distal ureter continues to remain a surgical dilemma.

However, the biological mechanisms of BPH development remain largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the essential genomic and immunogenic features in BPH. Materials and Methods: Transcriptome profiling and clinical data of BPH and normal prostate samples were acquired from GEO datasets. The discovery sets were composed of GSE119195, GSE7307, GSE101486, while the validation set was GSE132714. ESTIMATE and CIBERSORT were used to investigate the immunogenic features. Furthermore, transcriptional and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used for further analysis. Results: BPH samples presented a higher immune score. Meanwhile, CIBERSORT deconvolution revealed that BPH exists significantly abundant M2 Macrophages, follicular T helper cells, resting mast cells, and fewer plas-ma cells, activated CD4+ memory T cells, and activated mast cells. WGCNA analysis also revealed significantly enriched immune-related modules in BPH. Transcriptomic analysis identified SOCS3, IL6, C3, IGF1, NOTCH1, and VCAN as key regulators of immunogenic phenotype in BPH. Moreover, we generated an immunological gene signature for BPH, which worked well in the validation cohort. Conclusion: In our study, BPH samples exhibited a distinct immune infiltration pattern, represented by an im-munological gene signature. This genomic-based assessment model reveals the potential transcriptomic patterns during BPH development.

This can potentially increase the risk of urinary stone disease. Current literature on possible effects of Ramadan fasting on urolithiasis is rather limited. Having the gap in scientific background, we decided to evaluate the available comparative information in this systematic review. Materials and Methods: We included all studies comparing fasting and non-fasting conditions, studies evaluating stone formation and clinical manifestations of kidney stone disease. All the English studies published from January 1980 to the end of 2019 were included. The exclusion criteria were as followed: fasting out of Ramadan, non-comparative studies, animal studies, patients with bladder stones, and studies evaluating conditions that are only indirectly related to the stone formation or clinical manifestations of it. Applying the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for systematic review showed the quality of included studies was not high. Results: Only five studies remained after exclusion. Meta-analysis was not applicable due to the diversity in methods and evaluated population. Conclusion: Main trend of the included studies is toward showing no difference between fasting and non-fasting conditions in terms of renal stone formation. However, generalization of the findings to greater populations should be applied carefully considering the heterogeneity of results and quality of studies.

Current chemotherapy approaches have not adequately increased patient survival. Therefore, in this study, tissue proteome of patients with MIBC was performed to introduce possible protein candidates for bladder cancer prognosis as well as targeted therapy. Materials and Methods: After obtaining tumoral and non-tumoral tissues of MIBC patients, and normal bladder tissue of non-bladder cancer patients, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were used to analyze tissue proteome. Gelsolin-like Actin-capping (CAPG) protein was further examined using Real-time PCR and western blot analysis. Results: The 2-DE analysis and LC-MS/MS identified CAPG protein as differentially expressed protein in tumor and non-tumor tissues of bladder cancer compared with normal tissues. Western blot analysis showed the CAPG overexpression in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues in a stage-dependent manner. Correspondingly, Real-time PCR showed a higher mRNA expression in tumoral bladder tissues than normal ones. CAPG mRNA overexpression had significantly a positive relation with tumor size (P = 0.019), the TNM staging (P = 0.001), and tumor differentiation (grade) (P = 0.006). Patients with lower levels of CAPG had higher recurrence-free survival in comparison with patients with higher levels (P = .027). Conclusion: CAPG overexpression was correlated with size, stage, grade, and shorter time to recurrence of bladder cancer. Therefore, CAPG overexpression could be related to poor prognosis of bladder cancer. These results suggest that CAPG may be considered as a prognostic factor and also for targeted therapy in bladder cancer. Moreover, it could be concluded that cancerous and noncancerous tissues of MIBC have the same protein expression because 2-DE results showed the CAPG expression in cancer and adjacent cancer tissues of bladder while CAPG was not detectable in normal tissues of bladder.

Materials and Methods: The expression of NPM1 was analyzed by PCR and Western blot. NPM1 silencing bladder cancer cells (T24/DDP Lv-NPM1, PUMC-91/DDP Lv-NPM1) and overexpressing bladder cancer cells (T24/DDP Lv5-NPM1, PUMC-91/DDP Lv5-NPM1) were established by lentivirus and limited dilution method. The efficiency of gene interference was detected by fluorescence microscopy and Western blot. The migration ability and invasion ability of tumor in vitro were analyzed by wound healing assay and transwell cell invasion test, and the tumorigenic ability in vivo was judged by nude mouse tumorigenicity assay. Results: Compared with the corresponding negative control group, both NPM1 silencing cell lines T24/DDP Lv-NPM1 and PUMC-91/DDP Lv-NPM1 showed strong migration ability and high invasive ability. At the same time, there was no significant difference in migration ability and the invasive cells proportion between NPM1 overexpressing cell line and related negative control group. NPM1 silencing bladder cancer cells had obvious tumorigenicity in vivo. Conclusion: NPM1 silencing cells had significant migration and invasion ability. The silencing of NPM1 will accelerate tumorigenicity of drug resistant bladder cancer. Differential expression of NPM1 is of great value in monitoring the progression of drug-resistant bladder cancer.

J	Rangganata, E; Rahardjo, HE				Rangganata, Ervandy; Rahardjo, Harrina Erlianti			The Effect of Preoperative Pelvic Floor Muscle Training on Incontinence Problems after Radical Prostatectomy: A Meta-Analysis	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Review						pelvic floor muscle training; urinary incontinence; radical prostatectomy	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; STRESS URINARY-INCONTINENCE; POSTPROSTATECTOMY INCONTINENCE; ERECTILE FUNCTION; CONTINENCE; MEN; BIOFEEDBACK; OUTCOMES; DYSFUNCTION; RECOVERY	Purpose: To evaluate whether additional pelvic floow muscle training (PFMT), which began before radical prostatectomy and resumes immediately after catheter removal, will significantly improve urinary incontinence after RP. Materials and Methods: We reviewed articles obtained from MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EBSCOHost, CINAHL, and Elsevier from July - August 2020, which compared preoperative PFMT with postoperative PMFT or non-PFMT, with continence incidence parameters. There were no restrictions on the definition of incontinence, treatment regimens, and radical prostatectomy surgical approach. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. A meta-analysis was also carried out to pool the effect estimates. Results: We included 12 eligible studies in this review, 11 of which we included in the meta-analysis. The PFMT initiated preoperatively significantly reduced the incidence of persistent urinary incontinence at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively with an OR of 0.58 (95% CI, 0.41-0.81), 0.57 (95% CI, 0.43-0.74), and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.17-0.83). There was no difference in improvement in patients' incontinence at 12 months postoperatively [OR = 1.31 (95% CI, 0.65-2.63)]. Conclusion: PFMT initiated before radical prostatectomy significantly reduced the incidence of urinary incontinence in the first, third, and sixth months postoperatively. At 12 months postoperatively, additional preoperative PFMT did not cause a significant difference in urinary incontinence incidence.

Laparoscopic Pyelolithotomy for the Management of Large Renal Stones with Intrarenal Pelvis Anatomy	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						intrarenal; kidney anatomy; laparoscopy; urolithiasis	CLINICAL-RESEARCH OFFICE; PERCUTANEOUS NEPHROLITHOTOMY; TRANSPERITONEAL PYELOLITHOTOMY; EXPERIENCE; STAGHORN; OUTCOMES; CALCULI	Purpose: The role of laparoscopic pyelolithotomy (LPL) in the management of renal stones is evolving. One of the challenges in LPL for renal stones is patients with intrarenal pelvis. Here we present our experience with laparoscopic pyelolithotomy for the management of renal stones with intrarenal pelvis anatomy. Materials and Methods: Patients candidate for laparoscopic pyelolithotomy from February 2014 to March 2015 were included. Intrarenal pelvis was defined as > 50% of the renal pelvis area contained inside renal parenchyma. Laparoscopic pyelolithotomy was done by transperitoneal approach. Residual stones were checked by computed tomography and/or intravenous pyelography and ultrasonography 6 weeks after the operation. Results: 28 patients were included in this study. The mean +/- SD of patients' age was 45.8 +/- 12.5 years. 19 patients (68%) were male. Stone locations were pelvis, multiple, and staghorn in 22, 3, and 3 patients respectively. The mean +/- SD of operation duration was 160 +/- 48 minutes. Residual stones were observed in 3 patients with multiple (n=2) or staghorn (n=1) stones. Urinary leak was observed in 3 patients and was managed conservatively in 2 patients. In one patient ureteral stent was inserted by cystoscopy. No conversion to open surgery or re-operation occurred. Conclusion: Laparoscopic pyelolithotomy is a feasible operation for patients with renal stones and intrarenal pelvis in centers with adequate experience in laparoscopy. However, the success of LPL decreases in patients with multiple stones and intrarenal pelvis.

Analysis of Risk Factors from A Multicentric Database	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						laser; prostatectomy; retention	BENIGN PROSTATIC OBSTRUCTION; PHOTOSELECTIVE VAPORIZATION; MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES; SAFETY; COMPLICATIONS; ENUCLEATION; EFFICACY; THERAPY	Purpose: Greenlight laser is a mini-invasive technique used to treat Benign Prostatic Obstruction (BPO). Some of the advantages of GreenLight photoselective vaporization (PVP) are shorter catheterization time and hospital stay compared to TURP. Post-operative acute urinary retention (pAUR) leads to patients' discomfort, prolonged hospi-tal stay and increased health care costs. We analyzed risk factors for urinary retention after GreenLight laser PVP. Materials and Methods: In a multicenter experience, we retrospectively analyzed the onset of early and late post-operative acute urinary retention in patients undergoing standard or anatomical PVP. The pre-, intra-and post-operative characteristics were compared betweene patients who started to void and the patients who devel-oped post-operative urinary retention. Results: The study included 434 patients suitable for the study. Post-operative acute urinary retention occurred in 39 (9%). Patients with a lower prostate volume (P < .001), an adenoma volume lower than 40 mL (P < .001), and lower lasing time (P = .013) had a higher probability to develop pAUR at the univariate analysis. The multivar-iate logistic regression confirmed that lower lasing time (95% CI: 0.86-0.99, OR = 0.93, P = .046) and adenoma volume (95% CI: 0.89-0.98, OR = 0.94, P = .006) are correlated to pAUR. Furthermore IPSS > 19 (95% CI: 1.19-10.75, OR = 2.27, P = .023) and treatment with 5-ARI (95% CI: 1.05-15.03, OR = 3.98, P = .042) are risk factors for pAUR. Conclusion: In our series, post-operative acute urinary retention was related to low adenoma volume and lasing time, pre-operative IPSS > 19 and 5-ARI intake. These data should be considered in deciding the best timing for urethral catheters removal.

Androgens regulate this protein and may increase the risk of COVID-19. Therefore, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may protect patients with prostate cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infection or decrease the severity of the disease. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to study the effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on COVID-19 in patients with prostate cancer. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. All records underwent a two-step screening process to identify the eligible studies. The registered PROSPERO number of this study was CRD42021228398. We evaluated the effect of ADT on the risk of infection, hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality. Results: Six studies met inclusion criteria and were evaluated in this study. We performed meta-analysis on four eligible studies. The overall incidence of COVID-19 was 2.65% among patients with prostate cancer receiving ADT. COVID-19 mortality rate was about 22.7% in ADT (+) patients. ADT did not decrease the risk of any of the major outcomes; infection risk (OR= 0.63, 95% CI= 0.27-1.48, P = 0.29), hospitalization rate (OR= 0.51, 95% CI= 0.10-2.53, P = 0.41), ICU admission (OR= 1.11, 95% CI= 0.43-2.90, P = 0.82), and mortality risk (OR= 1.21, 95% CI= 0.34-4.32, P = 0.77). Conclusion: We did not observe a protective effect on the risk of infection, hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality in patients receiving ADT; therefore, it should not be considered as a prophylactic or treatment for COVID-19. On the other hand, ADT did not increase the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 and should be considered a safe treatment for patients with prostate cancer during the pandemic. Further studies are necessary to confirm our findings.

Materials and Methods: All patients with renal stones larger than 2.5 cm, who had undergone mPCNL, were included in the period between April 2018 and September 2019. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify clinical variables associated with post-operative fever (>38 degrees C). Results: A total of 53 patients were enrolled for whom the median maximal stone length was 3.08 cm. 24 (45%) patients had a fever after mPCNL. Significantly more patients with urine WBC > 27(/HPF) had a fever after surgery (p = 0.004). No significant between-group differences in urine cultures were found for the fever and non-fever groups (p = 0.094). Stepwise and multivariable logistic regression analyses all revealed that urine WBC > 27(/ HPF) is the only risk factor for developing post-mPCNL fever. Based on the highest body temperature, all of the patients were assigned into no fever, mild fever (37.5 <= Temp < 38.0), and fever groups, and an ordinal logistic regression analysis still supported the premise that the result of urine analysis is strongly associated with post-mPCNL fever. Conclusion: Large renal stones are challenging to treat and associated with severe complications. Approximately 45% of large renal stone patients treated via mPCNL developed a fever. Urine WBC can easily and directly predict the risk of fever.

J	Heidler, S; Lusuardi, L; Dietersdorfer, F				Heidler, Stefan; Lusuardi, Lukas; Dietersdorfer, Franz			First Report of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients with Implanted InterStim Twin (model 7427T) Sacral Nerve Stimulator	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						magnetic resonance imaging; sacral nerve stimulator; InterStim Twin	SAFETY; NEUROMODULATION; MRI	Purpose: To detect possible effects of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans on the function of an InterStim Twin sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) device and on patient's health. There is currently no authorization for MRI scans in InterStim Twin SNS at all. Material and Methods: 10 patients with Interstim Twin sacral nerve stimulator implants underwent a singular MRI scan. Before the MRI was performed, the SNS device function was evaluated and the device was deactivated by the implanting urologist. Continuous monitoring took place during the MRI procedure. Micturition-time chart pre-and post MRI procedures were conducted. After the MRI session was completed, the implanted device was examined once more and reactivated, function was then re-evaluated. Results: A total of 10 patients required MRI examinations in 8 different body regions. No patient reported pain or discomfort during and after the MRI scan. After reactivation of the InterStim Twin device following the MRI, impedances and stimulation amplitude, micturition frequency, urgency, and incontinence episodes remained stable. No significant differences between pre-and post MRI were found (p > 0.05). Conclusion: This is the first report of patients successfully undergoing a MRI scan despite a previously implanted Interstim Twin sacral nerve stimulator. No negative effect of SNS function or negative side effects for the patients were observed.

If this condition does not treat early in life, it will be a lifelong problem. During recent decades, electrical stimulation therapy has been expanded and extensively used for the treatment of LUTD in both adults and children. The aim of this review is to suggest clinicians an updated understanding of effects of interferential (IF) electrical stimulation therapy in management of LUTD in children. Materials and methods: The search was performed in databases of Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, ,and Scopus for information about IF electrical stimulation and its application using search words such as " IF electrical stimulation", "transcutaneous IF electrical stimulation" , "IF therapy " , " electrical stimulation", "voiding dysfunction" , " LUTD", " urinary incontinence" and " children". As this review focuses on the answer of this question "Does transcutaneous IF electrical stimulation has effect on management of LUTD in children?" we included the reference list of articles identified by this search strategy and selected those we judged relevant according to our keywords. Clinical trial studies in English were included. Categorical data were reported as frequencies and percentages. Results: Eleven studies were included in this review. The success rate of IF therapy in these studies has been reported from 61% to 90% of children with LUTD and urinary incontinence. Conclusion: IF electrical stimulation is an effective, safe and reproducible option to manage LUTD and urinary incontinence in children.

In addition, NRF-2 and KEAP-1 complex have a powerful effect on the intracellular organization of the antioxidants. We evaluated the relation of Copper, Zinc, NRF-2, and KEAP-1 complex regarding the oxidative stress with tumor stage - grade in patients with bladder cancer. Materials and Methods: A total of 52 patients (32 bladder cancer and 20 control group) were included in the study. The demographic properties of groups were identical. Serum NRF-2, KEAP-1, Cu, and Zn levels were compared by ELISA method between the groups, and tissue NRF-2, KEAP-1, Cu and Zn levels were evaluated also by ELISA method in cancer patients. Results: Serum levels of NRF-2 and KEAP-1 of the bladder cancer patients were found to be higher than the control group (p = 0.004 and p = 0.001, respectively). On the other hand serum levels of Copper and Zinc were found to be lower than the control group (p = 0.008 and p = 0.001, respectively). However, the subgroup analysis according to the stages and grades of the tumour showed no difference. The Copper level obtained from the tissue analysis was detected to be considerably decreased with tumour stage and grade. Conclusion: Bladder cancer patients had higher serum NRF-2 and KEAP-1 levels and lower serum Copper and Zinc levels. In addition, the Copper levels decreased with the tumour stage and grade. Studies with larger number of patients are needed to demonstrate the efficacy of these markers.

Materials and Methods: Forty adult Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Control (CON), NCT administrated (4 mg/kg) (NCT), QU treated (25 mg/kg for 7 days) (QU), and nicotine with quinine received (NCT+QU). After 28 days, serum testosterone and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. Testes and epididymides samples were prepared for determining tissue MDA levels, histomorphometry, microscopic indices of spermatogenesis, immunohistochemistry of p53 and sperm analysis. Results: Testosterone levels were decreased significantly (P =.0004) in treated groups compared to CON group. Serum MDA levels were increased significantly (P =.0004) in NCT and QU groups compared to CON group. Tissue MDA levels were increased significantly (P =.0012) in NCT+QU group in comparison to CON group. These parameters were changed significantly in NCT+QU group compared to QU group. Seminiferous tubules diameter decreased significantly (P <.0001) in treated groups compared to CON group and in NCT+QU group compared to QU group. The height of germinal epithelium decreased significantly (P =.0001) in NCT and NCT+QU groups compared to CON and QU groups. The number of Sertoli cells, spermatocytes, and spermatids decreased significantly in treated groups compared to CON group. The number of spermatogonia decreased significantly (P =.0017) in NCT and NCT+QU groups compared to CON group. The number of Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, and spermatocytes decreased significantly in NCT+QU group compared to QU group. All indices of spermatogenesis decreased in treated groups compared to CON group. The lowest mean of these indices was observed in NCT+QU group. The sperm viability decreased significantly (P <.0001) in treated groups compared to CON group. Sperm count and motility decreased significantly in NCT and NCT+QU groups compared to CON group. All experimental groups showed the over-expression of p53 compared to CON group. Conclusion: The administration of nicotine could be involved in the exacerbation of testicular tissue alterations related to quinine therapy.

Materials and Methods: From March 2016 to June 2018, data of 96 patients with radiolucent nephrolithiasis and hyperuricemia who referred to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were retrospectively analyzed. These patients were divided into allopurinol 300mg/d (control), febuxostat 40mg/d (F40) and 80mg/d (F80) groups respectively. All patients took potassium citrate as a combination treatment and had been followed up for at least 6 months. Before treatment and on after 1st, 3rd and 6th month, complete blood count, serum uric acid (sUA), hepatic and renal function as well as ultrasound were carried out. Arthritic and gastrointestinal symptoms were also monitored. Computed tomography was performed before treatment and 6 months after medication. Results: Compared with allopurinol group, F40 group showed no difference in urate-lowering effect, while F80 had the best effect across all the visits (P<0.01). At 6th month, 25(83.3%) cases of F80 group achieved sUA<6mg/dL, which was better than allopurinol group (18 cases, 58.1%) and F40 group (17 cases, 58.6%). In the dissolution effect of radiolucent calculi, F80 had the best effect, followed by F40 and then allopurinol (P<0.05). No statistical difference was observed in adverse events among three groups. Conclusion: Febuxostat significantly decreased sUA, promoted radiolucent stone dissolution and reduced the total stone number, whereas it did not increase the adverse events.

A Prospective Study about 1,000 Consecutive Patients, with Oncological and Functional Results	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						functional results; laparoscopy; oncological results; prostatectomy; prostatic neoplasms; retrograde extraperitoneal laparoscopic prostatectomy	RADICAL RETROPUBIC PROSTATECTOMY; CANCER CONTROL; TRANSPERITONEAL; EXPERIENCE	Purpose: Usual laparoscopic surgery of localized prostate cancer uses antegrade dissection. We describe and eval-uate the original RELP (Retrograde Extraperitoneal Laparoscopic Prostatectomy). Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort of 1005 patients with clinically localized cancer prostate who were operated on from December 1999 to September 2013, in Lyon (France), and followed up to 172 months (median: 60 months). Patients encountered a RELP procedure, a totally extra-peritoneal approach with a retrograde dissec-tion from the apex to the bladder neck, and ascending dissection of the erectile neurovascular bundles, facilitated by the 30 degrees optic telescope. Adjunctive treatments were: immediate radiotherapy (9.2%), salvage radiotherapy (13.4%), androgen deprivation therapy (10.8%), chemotherapy (1.4%), no treatment (75.8%). Results: The mean age was 63.4 years, the Gleason score was 4+3 or worse in 24.9%, there were 2.3% unifocal tumors. The pathology stages were pT2A (8.71%), pT2B (2.80%), pT2C (69.0%), pT3A (13.1%), and pT3B (6.41%). There were 60.8% negative margins (R0) in total (90.1% for basal locations, and 75.8% for apical loca-tions). The mean operating time was 115 minutes for the last 100 patients. The BPFSR (biological progression free survival rate, PSA <= 0.10 ng/ml) was 71.9% at 5 years, and 61.4% at 10 years. The cancer specific survival rate was 99.4% at 5 years, and 98.3% at 10 years. After 12 months, 88.6% of patients did not require an incontinence pad, and 67.0% retained the pre-operative quality of their erection. Conclusion: RELP yields good oncologic results and quality of life, as good as robot-assisted surgery.

Materials and Methods: Male patients (n = 241) with redundant prepuce and/or phimosis were included in a clinical trial from January 2019 to March 2020. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on the surgical method: group A, traditional circumcision (n = 79); group B, modified circumcision (n = 80); and group C, disposable suturing device circumcision (n = 82). Results: The operation times in groups A, B, and C were 25.2 +/- 3.3 min, 10.2 +/- 2.7 min, and 6.7 +/- 1.4 min, respectively. The volumes of intraoperative blood loss in groups A, B, and C were 12.7 +/- 2.3 mL, 8.1 +/- 3.4 mL, and 2.2 +/- 0.8 mL, respectively (P < 0.05). Groups A and B were superior to group C in terms of the 6-h postoperative visual analog scale score and appearance satisfaction (P < 0.05). There were no obvious differences in the 7-day postoperative pain score and total healing time (P > 0.05). The operating expenses in groups A and B were lower than that in group C (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Modified circumcision, with its advantages of shorter operation time, less blood loss and pain, lower cost, and better postoperative penile appearance, is easily accepted by patients and deserves wide clinical application.

Materials and Methods: Between January 2013 and April 2019, patients who suffered from parapelvic cysts and received fURS or laparoscopy at our hospital were recruited for this study. All patients underwent biopsies of the cyst wall. Primary outcome was treatment success, which was defined as symptomatic and radiological. During follow-up, telephone contact and CT scans were used to record any relevant symptoms and any recurrence, respectively. Results: A total of 33 patients (22 in fURS; 11 in laparoscopy) were included in this study. Flank pain prior to the procedures were reported by 14/22 patients and 6/11 in fURS and laparoscopy, respectively (P=.62), and patients had complete pain relief after the operation. The complication rate was significantly lower in the fURS group than in the laparoscopy group (P=.01). Minor complications were observed in 3/22 and 5/11 patients (Grade 1 and 2) in the fURS and laparoscopy group, respectively. All patients were controlled by conservative treatment. However, 1/11 major complication (Grade 3b) was detected in the laparoscopy group and managed by ureteroscopy to remove the obstruction under general anesthesia. Significant differences were found in operative time (P=.01) and postoperative hospital stay (P=.01), while medical expenses were similar between the two groups (P=.42). During follow-up, no recurrence was detected in CT scans. Conclusion: In the management of parapelvic cysts, two minimally invasive surgeries were comparable in efficiency. However, fURS was superior to laparoscopic unroofing with regard to the complication rate, operative time, and postoperative hospital stay.

Methods: The standard double-back translation method, provided by the previous studies were utilized by three professional linguists to translate the English version of the NIH-CPSI to Persian, and a group of 10 urologists further reviewed and translated questionnaire. The questionnaire was then presented to the sample study, comprised of 60 men with CP/CPPS and 60 controls with adverse urological history, and the collected data was analyzed through IBM-SPSS software to test its validity, evaluative, and discriminatory power, psychometric qualities and internal consistency. Results: A total of 80 subjects (42 CP/CPPS patients and 38 healthy controls) were considered eligible for this study. The total Persian NIH-CPSI scores and each subdomain showed significant difference (P < 0.001) between the two study groups, indicating a satisfactory discriminant validity for the index. Psychometric analysis established the index to benefit from a high internal consistency. The translation was also considered by both the subjects and the physicians to be easily comprehensible. Conclusion: The Persian NIH-CPSI is a reliable and valid instrument for evaluating CP/CPPS symptoms in general population, while also benefitting from high discriminatory power, and can be utilized with ease in both clinical practice and laboratory studies.

Materials and Methods: In this study, 32 two-month old male Wistar albino rats were equally divided into the Sertraline-treated and the control groups. The drug group was gavaged with Sertraline daily while the control group was gavaged with water at the same volume. After 80 days, half of the rats in each group were selected randomly for hormonal evaluations and bilateral orchiectomy. Histological and hormonal evaluations were performed. The remaining half of rats were kept alive for 90 more days without intervention and then underwent hormonal evaluation and bilateral orchiectomy in a similar fashion. Results: There was no difference between the testes histology and pathology of the sertraline-treated and the control groups. There was a significant decrease in serum FSH in the Sertraline-treated group compared to the control group (P <0.05). However, this decline appeared to be reversible following termination of exposure to Sertraline. FSH returned to pretreatment levels in the remaining treated rats following 90 days of treatment cessation. Conclusion: Within the time-frame studied, Sertraline can induce transitory changes in serum FSH of male rats without concomitant spermatogenic changes within the testes. This hormonal change appears to be reversible following withholding of Sertraline. The long-term effect of Sertraline usage on hormonal status and spermatogenesis in rats needs further investigation.

Materials and Methods: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 26 MIBC patients were randomized to receive either nanocurcumin (180 mg/day) or placebo during the course of chemotherapy. All patients were followed up to four weeks after the end of treatment to assess the complete clinical response to the chemotherapy as primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were the comparisons of chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity, hematologic nadirs, and toxicities between the two groups. Hematologic nadirs and toxicities were assessed during the treatment. Results: Nanocurcumin was well tolerated. The complete clinical response rates were 30.8 and 50% in the placebo and nanocurcumin groups, respectively. Although nanocurcumin was shown to be superior to placebo with respect to complete clinical response rates as the primary endpoint, there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.417). No significant difference was also found between the two groups with regard to grade 3/4 renal and hematologic toxicities as well as hematologic nadirs. Conclusion: These preliminary data indicate the feasibility of nanocurcumin supplementation as a complementary therapy in MIBC patients and support further larger studies. Moreover, a substantial translational insight to fill the gap between the experiment and clinical practice in the field is provided.

Materials and Methods: Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched through December 2019. Comparative studies comparing the two approaches were included. The primary outcome was a single-procedure success rate; the secondary outcomes included operative time, hospital duration, and complications (according to the Clavien-Dindo Grade). Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) and the modified Jadad scale were used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. The Egger's test estimated publication bias. The meta-analysis was performed by Review Manager 5.3 and STATA 15.0. Results: Seven studies, involving 125 participants in LTU group and 128 in LRU group, were included in the study. The results suggested that both single-procedure success rate and the rate of postoperative paralytic ileus were significantly higher in the LTU group than in the LRU group (95.2% vs 87.5%, 95% CI: .00-.16, RD = .08, P = .04; 10.4% vs 0, 95% CI: .02-.19, RD = .10, P = .02, respectively). No publication bias of the primary outcome was observed with the Egger's test (P = .117). No significant differences were noted in terms of operative time and hospital duration (95% CI: -18.95-8.80, MD = -5.08, P = .47; 95% CI: -.98-.58, MD = -.20, P = .61, respectively). Additionally, according to Clavien-Dindo Grade, the rates of major complications (>= Grade 3a) including open conversion (.8% vs 5.5%, 95%CI: -.11-.01, RD = -.05, P = .12), stone migration (8.1% vs 6.7%, 95% CI: -.08-.11, RD = .02, P = .76), vascular injury (5.4% vs 0, 95%CI: -.03-.14, RD = .05, P = .21) and ureteral stricture (1.3% vs 5.3%, 95% CI: -.11-.02, RD = -.04, P = .20), were comparable between the two groups. Conclusion: In the treatment of large and proximal ureteral calculi, LTU has a significantly higher single-procedure success rate and a higher rate of postoperative paralytic ileus than LRU. However, the complication was well-tolerated. The small sample size and limited, including studies, were the main limitations.

This study evaluated the clinical results of treating the high stage prolapse of the anterior vaginal wall using a trans-obturator approach and the native vaginal wall tissue. Methods: This was a prospective analysis of 94 patients with anterior vaginal wall prolapse stage >= III. They underwent surgery with the trans-obturator approach using the native vaginal wall tissue. The objective primary outcome was evaluated according to the pelvic organ prolapse staging system (POP-Q). The subjective primary outcome was evaluated with pelvic floor distress inventory (PFDI-20) and pelvic floor impact questionnaire (PFIQ-7) questionnaires. The secondary outcomes were post-surgery complications. Results: Totally, 85 of 94 patients were followed up for a mean of 38.2 +/- 4 months. The objective anatomical success rate was 90.58%. PDFI-20 and PFIQ-7 scores had improved (P = 0.001). The complications were minor (G1) according to the Clavien-Dindo classification (8.2 %). At one year follow up 3 out of 8 patients with clinical SUI underwent transvaginal repair with the Poly propylene mini sling mesh. Conclusion: The midterm results of the surgical repair of the high stage anterior vaginal wall prolapse are promising with a new surgical technique by trans-obturator approach and native vaginal wall as the supportive layer	[Sharifiaghdas, Farzaneh] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Urol & Nephrol Res Ctr, Shahid Labbafinejad Med Ctr, Tehran, Iran		Sharifiaghdas, F (通讯作者)，Urol Nephrol Res Ctr, 103,9th Boostan St,Pasdaran Ave, Tehran, Iran.	f.sharifiaghdas@gmail.com	Sharifiaghdas, Frazaneh/AAV-5651-2021				Amin K, 2019, UROL CLIN N AM, V46, P61, DOI 10.1016/j.ucl.2018.08.008; Balzarro M, 2018, NEUROUROL URODYNAM, V37, P278, DOI 10.1002/nau.23288; Barski Dimitri, 2014, Surg Technol Int, V24, P217; Bump RC, 1996, AM J OBSTET GYNECOL, V175, P10, DOI 10.1016/S0002-9378(96)70243-0; Cosson M, 2001, EUR J OBSTET GYN R B, V95, P73, DOI 10.1016/S0301-2115(00)00341-9; Durnea C, 2018, INT UROGYNECOL J, V29, P1727, DOI 10.1007/s00192-018-3781-5; Ferrari A, 1997, AM J OBSTET GYNECOL, V177, P1426, DOI 10.1016/S0002-9378(97)70086-3; Handel LN, 2007, J UROLOGY, V178, P153, DOI 10.1016/j.juro.2007.03.041; Lavelle RS, 2016, J UROLOGY, V195, P1014, DOI 10.1016/j.juro.2015.10.138; Lemack GE, 2016, CAMPBELL WALSH UROLO, V11, P1743; Maher C, 2016, COCHRANE DB SYST REV, DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD004014.pub6; Maher C, 2010, COCHRANE DB SYST REV, DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD004014.pub4; Mallipeddi PK, 2001, INT UROGYNECOL J PEL, V12, P83, DOI 10.1007/s001920170070; Minassian VA, 2014, NEUROUROL URODYNAM, V33, P72, DOI 10.1002/nau.22396; Moore RD, 2010, INT UROGYNECOL J, V21, P545, DOI 10.1007/s00192-009-1071-y; Olsen AL, 1997, OBSTET GYNECOL, V89, P501, DOI 10.1016/S0029-7844(97)00058-6; PARKER MC, 1993, ANN ROY COLL SURG, V75, P193; PORGES RF, 1994, AM J OBSTET GYNECOL, V171, P1518, DOI 10.1016/0002-9378(94)90395-6; Rane A, 2012, AUST NZ J OBSTET GYN, V52, P28, DOI 10.1111/j.1479-828X.2011.01384.x; RAZ S, 1989, J UROLOGY, V142, P712, DOI 10.1016/S0022-5347(17)38863-8; Samuelsson EC, 1999, AM J OBSTET GYNECOL, V180, P299, DOI 10.1016/S0002-9378(99)70203-6; Shah HN, 2012, INDIAN J UROL, V28, P129, DOI 10.4103/0970-1591.98453; Sharifiaghdas F, 2015, KOREAN J UROL, V56, P811, DOI 10.4111/kju.2015.56.12.811; Smith FJ, 2010, OBSTET GYNECOL, V116, P1096, DOI 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181f73729; White GR, 1912, T AM ASS OBSTETRICIA, V24, P323; Young SB, 2001, AM J OBSTET GYNECOL, V185, P1360, DOI 10.1067/mob.2001.119073; Young SB, 2001, AM J OBSTET GYNECOL, V185, P32, DOI 10.1067/mob.2001.116370	27	0	0	0	0	UROL & NEPHROL RES CTR-UNRC	TEHRAN	NO 44, 9TH BOUSTAN ST, PASADARAN AVE, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN	1735-1308	1735-546X		UROL J	Urol.

J	Mokhtari, MR; Farshid, S; Modresi, P; Abedi, F				Mokhtari, Mohammad Reza; Farshid, Saman; Modresi, Parisa; Abedi, Farzad			The Effects of Tranexamic Acid on Bleeding Control During and after Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL): A Randomized Clinical Trial	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						tranexamic acid; bleeding; percutaneous nephrolithotomy; Iran	BLOOD-LOSS; SURGERY; COMPLICATIONS	Purpose: Tranexamic acid is a fibrinolysis suppressor that is used for a variety of bleeding control procedures such as hematuria, surgery bleeding, and trauma caused bleeding. The advantages of using tranexamic acid are bleeding control and less need for blood transfusion. Materials and Methods: This double blind clinical trial was conducted on 108 patients in Imam Khomeni Hospital, Urmia, Iran 2013-14. The control and intervention groups consisted of 54 randomly selected participants each. The intervention group received 1gr of intravenous tranexamic acid with initiation of surgery and 500mg orally each 8hrs afterwards up to three days. The control group received placebo capsules containing starch of the same form. Results: The mean term of hospitalization in the intervention group was significantly shorter than that of the control group (P < 0.001). The difference between the two groups in terms of preoperative hemoglobin was not significant. However, the decrease in postoperative hemoglobin, intraoperative hemoglobin count in washing liquid, and hemoglobin count in the intervention group were significantly different from those of the control group (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The findings showed that tranexamic acid decreased bleeding during PCNL and the need for blood transfusion. It also decreased the hospitalization time.

To reduce these morbidities we introduced our own version of extra-peritoneal approach and compared it with the conventional method. Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional observational retrospective design, eligible bladder cancer patients whom underwent Extra-Peritoneal Radical Cystectomy (EPRC) or TPRC in our center, were considered for this study and were compared for early post-operative complications. Results: Ninety-nine patients in TPRC and 81 in EPRC were compared. The two techniques differed in their mean operation time (298.2 +/- 37.8 min TPRC vs. 262.8 +/- 37.2 min EPRC , P : 0.001). Early GI complications were lower in EPRC groups, including oral intake intolerance ( 21 vs. 8, P: 0.04), ileus (19 vs. 8, P : 0.04), intestinal obstruction (3 vs. 0, P : 0.04), and anastomosis leakage (8 vs. 1, P : 0.01). Urine leak (14 vs.7 , P : 0.02) and wound related complications (19 vs. 6 , P: 0.02) also favored EPRC group. Conclusion: The extra-peritoneal technique is beneficial in reducing postoperative morbidity, especially the more prevalent GI complications. This approach is functionally safe and allows preservation of the peritoneal integrity.

The short-term and long-term complications of these two procedures were also assessed. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, we included 160 consecutive patients with BPH who had undergone TURP (n=80) or OP surgery (n=80) from 2006 to 2017. Inclusion criteria were positive history of BPH, definite indication for prostatectomy, and prostate weight between 40 to 65 grams. Patients were evaluated for duration of hospitalization, need for re-operation, short-term and long-term postoperative complications, urinary flow rate, peak flow rate (Q max) and international prostate symptom score (IPSS). Results: The mean age +/- Standard Deviation (SD) of patients' age was 62.4 +/- 3.7 and 67.2 +/- 4.6 years in the TURP and OP groups, respectively. Four (5%) and seven (8.7%) patients required transfusion in the TURP group and OP groups, respectively. Dysuria was significantly more frequent in the TURP group from week two to 12 months after surgery as compared with the OP group (P < .001). Hemodynamic changes and decrease in serum sodium level were not reported in either group. However, the urinary retention and need for urinary catheterization in the first year was significantly different between the two groups with 10 cases (12.5%) in the TURP group and no cases in the OP group (P<0.001). The need for reoperation in the TURP group was reported (27 procedures on 19 patients) (33.7%) of patients. Furthermore, retrograde ejaculation (RE) was reported in 65 (81.2%) and 80 patients (100%) of the TURP and OP group, respectively. Conclusion: Despite the fact that TURP is the standard method of treatment for BPH when the prostate weighs between 40-65 grams, the results of our study showed that OP is a more efficient and safe surgery for these patients and is associated with less complications. Furthermore, the need for re-operation seems to be higher in patients with TURP.

Methods: Searching through the major medical databases such as PubMed, Science Citation Index, EMBASE, Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library for all published studies in English until 2018. The following search terms were used: "Finasteride", "dutasteride", "5 alpha reductase inhibitors", "5-ARIs", "prostate cancer", "prostate neoplasm" and the additional related studies were manually searched. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) assessed the qualities of studies, and the outcome measures were observed by RR or OR with 95% CIs. Results: We included 9 eligible studies for analyses from 2011 to 2017. We found that 5-ARIs group may have fewer progression (OR = 0.48 95%CI: 0.37-0.61 P < 0.00001, I2=4%p = 0.39) and lower pathological progression (OR = 0.46; 95%CI: 0.29-0.73; p = 0.001, I2=0% p = 0.45), compared with control groups. However, the OS did not show significant difference between two groups (OR=1.10; 95%CI:0.90-1.35; P = 0.35, I2 = 93% P < .00001 ). Conclusion: The use of 5-ARIs could prevent progression in PCA patients both clinical and pathological.

This study was run to determine the obturator nerve reflex by Thulium laser versus monopolar Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumors (TURBT). Materials and methods: After receiving the approval code IRCT20190624043991N4, one hundred and eightynine patients with bladder tumors from 2010 to 2016 were assessed, and among them, 35 patients were randomly assigned into two groups in a blinded manner; the first group (16 patients) received thulium laser and the second group (19 patients) were patients undergoing monopolar transurethral resection of bladder tumor after spinal analgesia. Clinical data, including different variables such as; age, tumor characteristics, gender, operation duration, types of leg jerking, and intraoperative complications, were recorded. The site of the obturator nerve was determined by nerve stimulation, anatomical landmarks, and ultrasonography. Leg jerking was compared in both groups. Results: Of the 35 patients, 28 cases were male, and 7 points were female. The mean +/- SD (range) of age was 62.0 +/- 6.9 (40-75) years in the Thulium laser group and 64.0 +/- 7.1 (41-77) years in the monopolar TURBT group. The mean operation time was not different between the two groups significantly (P > 0.05). Leg jerking was reported in 25% and 63.1% of the patients in Thulium laser and monopolar TURBT groups, respectively (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Thulium laser is a more feasible and effective method to prevent leg jerking in patients with bladder cancer; so, it is recommended more than monopolar Transurethral.

Asthenoteratozoospermia is a severe form of male infertility. Free radicals play an important role in infertility. In a previous study we found that asthenoteratozoospermic men had a lower mean percentage of sperm HSPA2+ and higher intracellular anion superoxide than normozoospermia. Antioxidants are thought to be able to counteract the negative effects of free radicals. We explored the efficacy of vitamin E in combination with Se on the level of sperm HSPA2+, intracellular anion superoxide, and chromatin integrity in these patients. Materials and methods: 60 patients entered the study. They were randomized to the treatment group of oral Se (200 rig) in combination with vitamin E (400 units) for 3 months (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30). Semen samples were obtained and assessed for sperm parameters, intracellular O2-, protamine deficiency, sperm HSPA2+ and apoptotic spermatozoa at baseline and after the treatment phase. Results: There were no significant differences in baseline semen parameters, intracellular O2-protamine deficiency, sperm HSPA2+ and apoptotic spermatozoa between the treatment and placebo groups. There was a statistically significant decrease in sperm apoptosis and the level of anion superoxide (P = .001) and an increase in sperm motility and viability (P = .001) in the treated group, but no significant difference was found in the percentage of sperm HSPA2+ and sperm protamine deficiency compared with baseline. Moreover, no significant change was found in these parameters in the placebo group after 3 months Conclusion: Our results showed that administration of vitamin E and selenium for three months may improve sperm motility and viability by decreasing intracellular anion superoxide and sperm apoptosis in asthenoteratozoospermic infertile men. We suggest that consuming these supplements before assisted reproductive technology (ART) may improve outcomes in these patients.

A Single-center Experience with 754 Patients	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy; levofloxacin; urine culture	RETROGRADE INTRARENAL SURGERY; PERCUTANEOUS NEPHROLITHOTOMY; RISK-FACTORS; INFECTIOUS COMPLICATIONS; KIDNEY-STONES; RENAL STONES; CEFTRIAXONE	Purpose: To determine the empirical usage of antibiotics and analyze the pathogen spectrum during the perioperative period of flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy (FURSL) with a focus on levofloxacin. Materials and Methods: This retrospective analysis included 754 patients who underwent FURSL successfully in our hospital from January 2015 to July 2019. All patients were sent for urine cultures and prescribed antibiotics during the perioperative period. Patients with negative preoperative urine cultures were divided into levofloxacin (LVXG) and non-levofloxacin groups (NLVXG) based on the empirical use of antibiotics. Operative time, the length of postoperative hospital stays and total hospital stays, total hospitalization costs, postoperative fever rate, and removal rate of stones were compared. Patients with positive urine cultures were analyzed for pathogen distribution and antibiotic resistance. Results: In the empirical use of antibiotics among 541 cases with negative urine cultures, the prescription rate of levofloxacin was 68.95%. Compared to that in NLVXG, LVXG had a lower cost of antibiotics but a higher postoperative fever rate and a longer hospital stay. There were no significant differences in operative time, the total hospitalization costs, and the removal rate of stones between the two groups. The top two common pathogens were Escherichia coli (36.11%) and Enterococcus faecalis (24.07%), with resistance rates of 74.36% and 71.15% to levofloxacin, respectively. Conclusion: Levofloxacin might be no longer suitable as the first-line choice of clinical experience when performing FURSL in some centers.

First Pediatric Report	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						robotic surgery; DSD; UTI; pelvic surgery; minimally invasive surgery	SURGERY	The Disorders of Sex Differentiation (DSD) represent a wide range of congenital anomalies of the genitalia. Surgical treatment of these cases may become a challenge. We present a case of a 16-year-old boy with 46 XX DSD, SRY negative, presented with persistent dribbling incontinence, recurrent UTI, and perineal pain. Past medical history included right orchiectomy, laparoscopic excision of uterus, fallopian tubes, and left streak gonad at another institution at the age of 2 years. The native vagina was left in place. VCUG confirmed the presence of the residual vagina (8 cm in maximum length), connected with the bulbar urethra. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic excision of the vagina was performed with satisfying short and long-term results.

J	Xu, ZH; Lv, JL; Zhou, S; Jia, CP; Wang, H				Xu, Zi-hao; Lv, Jian-lin; Zhou, Shuang; Jia, Chun-ping; Wang, Hao			Effect of the External Physical Vibration Lithecbole on the Discharge of Upper Urinary Stones: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Review						external physical vibration lithecbole; upper urinary stones; residual stones; meta-analysis	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; SHOCK-WAVE LITHOTRIPSY; MECHANICAL PERCUSSION; FRAGMENTS; MULTICENTER; CLEARANCE; INVERSION; OUTCOMES; CALCULI	Purpose: The external physical vibration lithecbole (EPVL) is a new device that accelerates the discharge of urinary stones by changing the patient's body position and providing multi-directional simple harmonic waves. It is clinically employed to improve the stone-free rate (SFR). However, it is not widely accepted in clinical practice due to the lack of high-level evidentiary support and a standard protocol. The present meta-analysis aims at the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of EPVL treatment in improving the SFR. Methods: This study was a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Medline, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to find randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as recent as April 2020 that evaluated the efficacy and safety of EPVL treatment for patients with stones/residual stones in the upper urinary tract. Results: In total, 7 prospective studies with 1414 patients were included. Compared with patients in the control group, patients treated with an EPVL (the intervention group) had higher SFRs (95% CI: 0.59-0.86, RR = 0.71, P = .0004) and lower complication rates (95% CI: 1.37-3.12, RR = 2.07, P = .0006). In a subgroup analysis based on previous surgery (ESWL, RIRS), the intervention group had an improved SFR as compared to the control group (95% CI: 0.59-0.95, RR = 0.75, P = .02; 95% CI: 0.56-0.73, RR = 0.64, P < .00001, respectively). In a subgroup analysis based on stone location, the SFRs for stones in the upper/middle/lower calyx and renal pelvis were significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group: for residual stones in the upper and middle calyx, 95% CI: 0.63-0.98, RR = 0.79, and P = .03; for residual stones in the lower calyx, 95% CI: 0.54-0.75, RR = 0.64, and P < .00001; for residual stones in the renal pelvis, 95% CI: 0.47-0.79, RR = 0.61, and P = .0002. However, the SFRs for ureter stones were not significantly different between groups (95% CI: 0.82-1.05, RR = 0.93, P = .23). Conclusion: The external physical vibration lithecbole can effectively improve the SFR after ESWL and RIRS without significant side effects, especially for residual stones in the upper/middle/lower calyx and renal pelvis.

Results from a Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						ureteroscopy; safety guide wire; randomized controlled trial	STONES; IMPACT; TIPS	Purpose: Experts recommend us to keep a safety guidewire during the process of upper urinary tract endoscopy, though there is a lack of high-level evidence to support the efficacy and safety of this opinion. This study was conducted to compare the outcome of ureteral stone breakage in the presence or absence of a safety guidewire. Materials and methods: Patients candidate for endoscopic breakage of ureteral stone using a semi-rigid ureteroscope, were randomly assigned in two groups based on keeping a safety guidewire (group1) or removing the guidewire (group2) before the process of breaking ureteral stone by lithoclast. Demographic factors, history of previous stone treatment, kidney function, stone location, symptoms duration and severity were recorded for each patient. Primary outcomes included success rate of stone treatment and secondary outcomes included number of attempts to enter to ureter, success rate of ureteral entry, success rate of stone achievement, stone migration rate and the success rate of ureteral stent insertion. The recorded data were entered to the SPSS software and descriptive statistical analysis including power calculation and non-inferiority design for the primary and secondary outcomes, was performed. P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: From January 2016 till May 2018, 320 patients were randomized with 160 patients in each arm. Considering the cases who were missed due to follow-up loss, there were 153 patients in group 1 and 147 patients in group 2 at the end of the study. Baseline data were equally distributed in both groups. Based on the initial analysis, the studied variables had no significant difference between two groups; though, according to the subgroup analysis of patients with proximal ureter stones, patients in Group 1 had higher rates of ureteral injury comparing to the patients in Group 2 (p = 0.03). Conclusion: According to our findings, keeping the safety guidewire through the process of endoscopic stone breakage (stone size: less than 1.5Cm) seems to add no significant benefit to the procedure outcome, while it increases the ureteral injuries in the proximal ureter stones, but not in mid or distal ureter stones.

Materials and Methods: A systematic review of English articles was performed in August 2019, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Trials were identified in a literature search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science using appropriate search terms. All comparative studies reporting diabetes mellitus, study characteristics, and outcome data including the relationship between diabetes mellitus and urinary continence data were included. Continence rates at different time after RP were compared. Odds ratio (OR) was used for the comparison and all the results were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Seven cohort studies comprising with 5944 participants were included, the percentage of DM patients was 8.7%. The results showed that DM decreased urinary continence rates at 12 months after RP (OR 0.54, 95%CI 0.36 to 0.81, p = 0.003). The continence rates were not significantly different between DM and Non-DM groups at short-term (catheter removal, 3 months, 6 months) and long-term (>12 months). When stratified by the surgical approaches, the pooled results in patients who underwent robot -assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) were similar to results of the overall analysis. Conclusion: DM has an adverse impact on the recovery of UC during the intermediate-term after RP. Well-designed trials with strict control of confounders are needed to make results more comparable.

Materials and Methods: The literatures were screened from the databases, including the Pubmed, Embase, Web of science and Cochrane Library up to January 20th, 2020. The meta-analysis was conducted by Meta-DiSc and quality assessment was performed by using the QUADAS. Furthermore, the sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio (LR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), as well as receiver operating curve (ROC) related to diagnostic accuracy were pooled. Results: A total of 6 articles containing 814 participants (379 patients) were included in the study. For PI-RADS V1, the combined sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR and DOR were 0.82 (95% CI: 0.77-0.85), 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77-0.85), 4.58 (95% CI: 2.55-8.22), 0.24 (95% CI: 0.18-0.34) and 24.00 (95% CI: 10.38-55.51). With regard to PI-RADS V2, the combined sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR and DOR were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84-0.91), 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77-0.84), 4.34 (95% CI: 1.98-9.49), 0.16 (95% CI: 0.08-0.32) and 33.39 (95% CI: 15.05-74.05), respectively. Furthermore, except that the sensitivity of PI-RADS V2 was significantly greater than that of PI-RADS V1 (P = 0.027), there was no remarkably difference in other indicators for the diagnosis of PCa between the two versions. Conclusion: Both PI-RADS V1 and PI-RADS V2 showed good diagnostic performance for PCa diagnosis; moreover, there was no difference in the diagnostic effect between them.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with stage I NSGCTs who underwent robotic or laparoscopic RPLND between 2008 and 2017. Perioperative data and oncologic outcomes were reviewed and compared between the two groups. Progression-free survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and compared between two groups. Results: A total of 31 and 28 patients underwent R-RPLND and L-RPLND respectively. The preoperative characteristics of the patients were comparable in the two groups. Patients in R-RPLND group had significantly shorter median operative time (140 vs. 175 minutes, P < .001), a shorter median duration to surgical drain removal (2 vs. 4 days, P = .002) and a shorter median postoperative hospital stay (5 vs. 6 days, P = .001). There were no statistical differences in intra-and post-operative complication rate between the groups and the oncologic outcomes were similar in the two groups. Conclusion: In expert hands, R-RPLND and L-RPLND were comparable in oncological parameter and morbidity rate; R-RPLND showed superiority in operation duration, median days to surgical drain removal and postoperative hospital stay for stage I NSGCTs. Multicenter and randomized studies with good power of study and sufficient follow-up duration are required to validate our result.

In this study, the incidence of BCG therapy adverse effects was compared among three groups of patients who received celecoxib, phenazopyridine, and oxybutynin with placebo. Materials and Methods: The randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on four groups using the parallel group method. A checklist is used for weekly assessment of urinary symptoms, systemic symptoms of BCG therapy, and adverse drug reactions. Results: The study included 120 patients, 10 female and 110 male. The mean age 59.65 +/- 6.2 years. The results of multivariate analysis show that there is a significant decrease in urinary frequency for patients who received phenazopyridine (95% CI: 0.09, 0.31, OR = 0.17, P <.001) and also celecoxib group (95% CI: 0.10, 0.43, OR = 0.21, P <.001) compared to those in placebo group. Patients in celecoxib group (95% CI: 0.02, 0.07,OR = 0.04, P <.001), phenazopyridine (95% CI : 0.07, 0.37,OR=0.16, P <.001) and oxybutynin (95% CI: 0.02, 0.12,OR = 0.05, P <.001) were less likely to have urgency than those in placebo. Moreover, significant decrease was found for dysuria in the three treatment groups in comparison with placebo group. Conclusion: According to the results, celecoxib, phenazopyridine and oxybutynin can effectively decrease the side effects of BCG immunotherapy compared to placebo. Among these three treatments, the most effective and safest treatment option is celecoxib.

Material And Methods: The files of 142 patients who underwent rigid or flexible ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy in our clinic between December 2018 and March 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. Total energy administered for the ablation of the stone was obtained from the registry of the Ho:YAG laser and recorded to the follow-up forms. The constant value was calculated for each stone, and the final mean value was figured out by calculation of the mean of all constant values. Results: The study was conducted with 142 patients; 102 males and 40 females. The mean age of the population was 46.61 +/- 14.58 years. The number of stones was 1.27 +/- 0.67. The mean constant value of energy needed per mm(3)xHU for urinary stones was 22.87 milliwatt. Conclusion: This study was conducted to report a predictive constant value and is the very first study evaluating the energy prediction per mm(3)xHU. The data of the study showed that the constant value is 22.87 mW/mm(3)xHU. Urologists may estimate the required energy and plan the surgery according to the outcomes of the study. As a future aspect of our study, the constant value may represent predictive information about the time and accuracy of the operation.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NTrap (R) in URS. Methods: From Jan 2014 to June 2017, 148 patients underwent URS with the aid of NTrap (R) (Group A), and 209 patients underwent standard URS without any anti-retropulsion device (Group B). Their demographics, operation time, complications, stone migration rate, and stone-free rate (SFR) were recorded for comparison. Results: Compared with group B, Group A had a significantly shorter operative and lasering time (P = 0.003, P<0.001, respectively). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in overall complications, a decrease in mean hemoglobin, and length of stay (LOS) (P = 0.426, P = 0.097, P = 0.058, respectively). The incidence of stone migration was significantly lower in Group A than Group B (P = 0.035). The postoperative auxiliary procedure rate (in patients with stones retropulsion during the operation) was significantly lower in Group A compared to Group B (P = 0.024). The SFR was considerably higher in Group A than Group B (P = 0.009). Conclusion: URS, with the aid of NTrap (R), is an effective and safe method for treating ureteric stones.

Here, we report the epidemiological characteristics of childhood CKD in Iran. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted during 1991 - 2009. The data were collected using the information in the Iranian Pediatric Registry of Chronic Kidney Disease (IPRCKD) core dataset. Results: A total of 1247 children were registered. The mean age of the children at registration was 0.69 +/- 4.72 years (range, 0.25 -18 years), 7.79 +/- 3.18 years for hemodialysis (HD), 4.24 +/- 1.86 years for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and 3.4 +/- 1.95 years for the children who underwent the renal transplantation (RT) (P <.001). The mean year of follow-up was 7.19 +/- 4.65 years. The mean annual incidence of CKD 2-5 stages was 3.34 per million age-related population (pmarp). The mean prevalence of CKD 2-5 stages was 21.95 (pmarp). The cumulative 1-, 5-, and 10-year patients' survival rates were 98.3%, 90.7%, and 84.8%, respectively. The etiology of the CKD included the congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) (40.01%), glomerulopathy (19.00%), unknown cause (18.28%), and cystic/hereditary/congenital disease (11.14%). Conclusion: The incidence and prevalence rate of pediatric CKD in Iran is relatively lower than those reported in Europe and other similar studies. CAKUT was the main cause of the CKD. Appropriate management of CAKUT including early urological intervention is required to preserve the renal function. Herein, the long-term survival rate was higher among the children with CKD than the literature.

Tamsulosin and Sodium Diclofenac as an Effective Therapy to Reduce Pain After Ureteral Stent Removal: A Prospective, Double Blinded Randomized Placebo Controlled Trial	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						tamsulosin; diclofenac sodium; pain; stent removal	IN-VITRO; DISCOMFORT; INHIBITORS; SYMPTOMS; EFFICACY; BLADDER	Purpose: This study was conducted to determine the effects of tamsulosin and diclofenac sodium use on patients' pain perception after ureteral stents removal. Materials and Methods: This study was a randomized control trial with double-blinded design. Eighty patients who underwent ureteral stent removal surgery at Kardinah Hospital during January to March 2017 were divided into four groups. The following medications were administered for two days, (A) placebo tid, or (B) diclofenac sodium 50 mg bid, or (C) tamsulosin 0.2 mg sid, or (D) combination of tamsulosin and diclofenac sodium. Analgesic effects were assessed with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Relationships among variables were assessed using one-way ANOVA and post hoc tests. Results: The surgical procedure for ureteral stent removal consisted of 48 (60%) male and 32 (40%) female. The average age of group A, B, C, and D were 51.0, 51.9, 47.6, and 47.3 years, and the average stent dwell time was 6.3 weeks. VAS values of the entire experimental group were lower than the control group on the first day until the second day after the stent removal (p < 0.05). In the experimental group, there was no difference between group B and C (p > 0.05). Group D showed better analgesic effects than group B and C (p <0.05). No severe side effects were observed. Conclusion: The result shows that combination therapy of diclofenac sodium and tamsulosin is better in reducing the pain after ureteral stent removal compared to the admission of a single placebo, tamsulosin, or diclofenac sodium therapy.

Pits on Ethylene Glycol-Induced Kidney Calculi in Rats	UROLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						calcium oxalate; date palm pits; ethylene glycol; kidney calculi; rat	CALCIUM-OXALATE; INDUCED UROLITHIASIS; STONE FORMATION; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; SEED EXTRACT; NEPHROLITHIASIS; VARIETIES; LAM.; STEM	Purpose: Urinary tract stones are one of the most common diseases in the urinary tract. Lack of kidney stone treatment causes irreparable damages to the kidneys, which has many harmful effects. Date palm pits are recommended in traditional medicine as an effective drug in the treatment of kidney stones. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of aqueous extract of date palm pits on kidney stones induced by ethylene glycol in male rats. Methods: In this study, 40 rats were classified into five groups (n = 8), including the healthy group receiving normal water, the negative control group, the therapeutic groups with doses of 150 mg/kg , 300 mg/kg , the prevention group with a dose of 300 mg/kg. In order to induce kidney stones, ethylene glycolated water (1%) was used as drinking water in the studied groups. Blood and urine of rats were collected on days 14 and 28 of the study to assess urinary parameters of calcium, creatinine, uric acid and phosphorus, and serum parameters of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, calcium, and phosphorus. Also, the kidneys of rats were removed from the body on day 28 of the study and were given to a pathologist for examination. Results: Results of serum parameters show that the use of date palm pits extract in the treatment and prevention groups with a dose of 300 mg/kg significantly (P < .05) has reduced the levels of blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, calcium, creatinine, and phosphorus. Also, the results of urinary parameters show that the use of the extract caused a significant decrease (P < .05) in creatinine, uric acid, and calcium in the prevention group and a significant de-crease (P < .05) in creatinine and uric acid in the therapeutic group with a dose of 300 mg/kg. Pathological results show a decrease in the number and size of calcium oxalate crystals in renal tubules in the treatment and prevention groups in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the use of aqueous extract of date palm pits has been effective in the treatment and prevention of kidney stones induced by ethylene glycol in rats.

Patients and Methods: Four patients recruited from our hospital from April 2016 to August 2017 underwent 3D printing technology-assisted laparoscopic cryoablation. Three-dimensional reconstruction technology was used to mimic cryoablation treatment before operations to determine the number of needles needed for the operation and the depth and angle required for needle insertion into the tumor to preserve nephron integrity. CT scans were used to assess the treatment's efficacy after operation during regular follow-up. Results: The operation was performed successfully in all cases and all patients recovered without major complications. The operation times ranged from 106 to 118 minutes and blood loss ranged from 50 to 100 mL. The follow-up times were between 8-16 months and the mean time was 13.3 months. Follow-up surveys were conducted regularly based on a standard outpatient protocol. Results showed no abnormal reinforcing signals in cryoablation treated areas. Conclusion: 3D printing technology-assisted laparoscopic cryoablation is a feasible method for the treatment of renal tumors and may be a way to better preserve nephrons, especially in elderly patients and/or those with comorbidities.

Results: Antioxidants have statistically significant effects on mean sperm concentration (untreated, 67.51 +/- 44.40 million/ml, vs. treated, 56.09 +/- 37.85 million/ml; P-value=0.005) and mean TUNEL score (untreated, 24.56% +/- 9.49%, vs. treated, 20.64% +/- 10.28%; P-value = 0.013). Moreover, a short abstinence period might have positive effects as shown on the TUNEL assay (20.64% +/- 10.28 vs. 17.38% +/- 8.59 ; P-value = 0.028) and CMA3 staining (47.79% +/- 20.78, vs. short 41.92% +/- 18.49; P-value = 0.019), when considering all study subjects. However, different results were obtained using more precise analysis based on a TUNEL cutoff score of 20%. The analysis showed that short abstinence might improve sperm DNA integrity in patients with TUNEL score > 20% (mean TUNEL score from 27.85% +/- 8.32% to 19.14% +/- 8.90% ; P-value =0.001%). However, it might have deleterious effects on sperm DNA integrity in patients with TUNEL score < 20% (mean TUNEL score from 11.89% +/- 3.21% to 15.17% +/- 7.79%; P-value = 0.045%) Conclusion: Our results showed that short abstinence may not be beneficial in all infertile males, and it should only be used in selected patients with abnormal DNA integrity.

Based on the prostate biopsy GS, clinicians choose the most appropriate therapy for managing patients. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine the discrepancy between needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy GS and to identify its predictive factors in the Iranian population. Materials and Methods: A total of 1147 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2009 to 2019 were initially enrolled in this study. After consideration of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 439 patients were finally included. The demographic variables and clinical data including age, PSA level, prostate volume, PSA density, GS derived from ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy specimen, and GS derived from radical prostatectomy specimen were collected from the medical records of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma and were reviewed by a urology resident. Results: The average age of patients was 64.5 years (range 48-84 years), and the average preoperative PSA level was 14.8 ng/mL. On histopathological examination, no changes in GS were observed in 237 (53.9%) patients, whereas GS was upgraded in 144 (32.8%) patients and downgraded in 58 (13.2%) patients at radical prostatectomy. The number of patients who had extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, and positive lymph nodes was significantly higher in the upgraded group compared with the non-upgraded group. Conclusion: In this study, there was a steady decrease in GS upgrading with the prostate size extending up to 49.7 g. There was also an association between downgrading and extending prostate size. Due to the greater risk of high-grade disease in men with small prostates, smaller prostate bulks are most probably upgraded after radical prostatectomy. A higher maximum percentage of involvement per core was an independent predictive factor of upgrading from biopsy grade 1 to grade >= 2. Our study showed that patients' age was not predictive of upgrading, which is consistent with other studies. Also, we demonstrated a non-significant relationship between PSA level and upgraded GS. Findings in this study did not demonstrate a significant relationship between PSA level and upgrading.

Materials and Methods: In this randomized crossover trial, a total of 40 men with HTN and LUTS symptoms were enrolled. The first group was treated with carvedilol, and the second group received terazosin plus enalapril. After eight weeks of treatment, the patients experienced a one-month washout period, and the treatments changed and were continued for eight weeks. To diagnose BPH in the study, the international prostate symptom score (IPSS) questionnaire was used. Moreover, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the post-void residual (PVR) urine volume, and the maximum urinary flow rate (Q-max using the uroflowmetry test) were measured. Results: Effect assessment results in this crossover trial illustrated neither carryover effects nor significant treatment effects on all primary outcomes (P > 0.05). Moreover, the results for the period effect indicated a significant reduction in BP (systolic and diastolic), PVR, and IPSS, yet a significant raise in Qmax. Conclusion: The effects of carvedilol are similar to those of the combination of terazosin and enalapril in patients with moderate HTN and BPH in controlling LUTS. Carvedilol could be used as an appropriative drug in patients with moderate HTN and cardiac problems with LUTS of BPH. Further studies are recommended to be conducted to investigate and compare the efficacy of carvedilol with that of other alpha-blockers with a larger sample size and over a longer period of time.

Materials and Methods: Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly selected and assigned to four groups: high fat diet (HFD)+BPH (n=10), HFD (n=10), BPH (n=10), and control (n=10) groups. Hyperinsulinemia was induced by HFD feeding, while BPH was induced using testosterone propionate. Plasma glucose, plasma insulin and bodyweight were examined weekly. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analysis were used to analyze the expression of ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 in rat prostates. Results: Plasma glucose and plasma insulin levels were significantly greater in the HFD+BPH and HFD groups, when compared to the other two groups (P < 0.05). Prostate weights were significantly greater in the HFD+BPH, HFD and BPH groups, than in the control group (P < 0.05). IHC and western blot analysis revealed that p-ERK1/2 expression was greater in the HFD+BPH group than in the other three groups (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Androgens plus a hyperinsulinemic condition induced by HFD can result in prostatic cell hyperplasia, and this mechanism may be correlated to the upregulation of p-ERK1/2. Further investigations of this possibility are required.

Materials and Methods: A total of 176 patients with UBC who underwent RC in a tertiary hospital between 2008 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The AGR was calculated as albumin/(total protein - albumin). In addition, the AGR was divided into two groups for the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards models were used for multivariate survival analysis. Results: The best cutoff AGR value for metastasis prediction was 1.32 based on the ROC curve analysis. Patients who had lower pretreatment AGR (<1.32) values composed the low-AGR group (n = 57; 32.4%). On the other hand, the remaining patients (n = 119; 67.6%) composed the high-AGR group. The patients in the low-AGR group had more advanced stage tumors compared with the patients in the high-AGR group. The Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that the patients in the low-AGR group had significantly lower rates of metastasis-free survival (MFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that preoperative AGR was an independent prognostic factor for MFS and CSS. Conclusion: In this single-institution retrospective study, lower preoperative AGR values demonstrated a poor prognostic effect on MFS and CSS in patients with UBC who underwent RC.
