J	Sharfstein, DJ				Sharfstein, Daniel J.			Brown, Massive Resistance, and the Lawyer's View: A Nashville Story	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							SEGREGATION; TENNESSEE	Editors' Note: For nearly 75 years, the Vanderbilt Law Review has sought to publish rigorous, intellectually honest scholarship. In publishing the following Essay, we seek to provide an equally unflinching look at one way in which Vanderbilt Law School and its graduates have participated in the creation of inequities that persist today. The Law School has produced legions of graduates committed to the pursuit of justice. Some alumni's legacies, however, are more complicated. Brown, Massive Resistance, and the Lawyer's View: A Nashville Story tells the story of one such alumnus. In many ways, Cecil Sims is a model of an engaged lawyer-citizen. A 1914 Vanderbilt Law School graduate, he was deeply involved in Nashville's civil society, serving as an advisor to Vanderbilt University, Meharry Medical College, and the Davidson County Board of Education. Sims was a driving force in reopening Vanderbilt Law School after World War II-without his efforts, the school might not even exist. Today, the Law School's most prominent annual lecture series still bears the Sims name. Vanderbilt Law School's history is intertwined with Sims's story. Sims's story, in turn, is intertwined with the racial oppression and inequality still present in Nashville today. Sims was a key architect of the city's school desegregation plan, which, though in compliance with Brown v. Board of Education, effectively maintained racial apartheid in public schools. If Sims's legacy includes his contributions to the Law School, so too does it encompass his role in helping to create Nashville's still-segregated school system. An honest account of Sims's life-and of Vanderbilt Law School's institutional history-requires both stories. Cecil Sims shows us that lawyers are not merely passive participants in the legal and political systems in which we work. Lawyers are leaders, for good or for ill. Stories like that of Cecil Sims, when told honestly, help us to think critically about our own roles as students, professionals, and scholars in the legal system. As Professor Sharfstein writes, lawyers construct worlds. We share this history in the hope that we may build better ones.

J	Fracassi, C; Magnuson, W				Fracassi, Cesare; Magnuson, William			Data Autonomy	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							MANDATORY DISCLOSURE; LAW; PRIVACY; INFORMATION; MARKET; COMPETITION; PROPERTY; FAILURE; UNCERTAINTY; PROTECTION	In recent years, "data privacy" has vaulted to the forefront of public attention. Scholars, policymakers, and the media have, nearly in unison, decried the lack of data privacy in the modern world. In response, they have put forth various proposals to remedy the situation, from the imposition of fiduciary obligations on technology platforms to the creation of rights to be forgotten for individuals. All these proposals, however, share one essential assumption: we must raise greater protective barriers around data. As a scholar of corporate finance and a scholar of corporate law, respectively, we find this assumption problematic. Data, after all, is simply information, and information can be used for beneficial purposes as well as harmful ones. Just as it can be used to discriminate and to embarrass, information can be used to empower and to improve. And while data privacy is often pitched at ending unauthorized data sharing, it all too often leads simply to the end of data sharing, period. This comes at a cost. Data silos can inhibit consumer choice, protect the positions of powerful incumbents, and reduce the efficiency of markets. The best example of these costs comes from the financial industry. For more than a century, banks and other financial institutions have built their information technology systems to keep financial records as private and nonshareable as possible. While security concerns can be a primary reason for such closed systems, banks also understand that financial data is an advantage that can protect them from market entry and competition. Banks can hold up consumers with unfavorable rates and inferior products as a result, and a set of market failures make it difficult for consumers to opt out. First, information asymmetries between consumers and financial institutions are large and difficult to resolve. Second, search and switch costs-the difficulty of finding out more information about the risks and benefits of financial products and of switching to a better financial service-are high in the financial industry. Finally, individuals struggle to take advantage of even simple financial strategies to save, borrow, and invest. Data sharing can help resolve these problems. The emergence of a new regulatory and technological framework called "open banking" raises the possibility of consumers being able to task trusted intermediaries with automatically analyzing their financial data, nudging them to achieve their goals, and switching them to better products, all in order to reduce the substantial inefficiencies in their financial lives. There is one problem, however. A combination of market failure and regulatory ambiguity has led to a situation in which data is limited, siloed, and inaccessible, thereby preventing individuals from using their data in efficient ways. Ultimately, this Article contends, resolving these problems will require us to replace the clarion call of "data privacy" with a new, more comprehensive concept, that of "data autonomy"-the ability of individuals to have control over their data. Data autonomy balances the need for data to be protected and secure with the need for it to be accessible and shareable. In this Article, we lay out a set of key principles that grant individuals a legal right to data autonomy, including a right of ownership over data, as well as obligations on institutions to safely share standardized and interoperable data with third parties that consumers so choose. Perhaps counterintuitively, the only way of expanding consumer welfare and protection today is by breaking down the barriers of data privacy.

J	Dillaway, ME				Dillaway, Margaret E.			The New "Web-Stream" of Commerce: Amazon and the Necessity of Strict Products Liability for Online Marketplaces	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							RESTATEMENT 2ND; SECTION 402A	Technology company Amazon has actively transformed into an e-commerce giant over the last two decades. Once a simple online bookstore, Amazon now boasts an ever-expanding identity as global cloud computing provider, major player in artificial intelligence, brick-and-mortar grocery store, and producer of original video content. At its roots, the company remains focused on e-commerce its multibillion-dollar online marketplace hosts a massive digital space for commerce worldwide where customers can order "anything, with a capital A." Amazon derives many of its sales from third-party vendors who list products on the company's website, Amazon.com. In this broadening chain of distribution for online retail, complicated tort issues arise in determining what entity should be held responsible when defective third-party products are sold to, and severely injure, consumers. Modern products liability law under the Restatement (Second) of Torts imposes strict liability on any seller of a defective product. Amazon has sought to avoid this liability by claiming it is not the seller but is instead a neutral platform that merely facilitates third party sales. And until recently, courts have agreed. Inspired by a handful of recent cases signaling a possible shift in U.S. products liability law, this Note proposes a statutory solution to hold online marketplaces such as Amazon to the same strict liability standards as brick-and-mortar retailers. This Note offers a statutory definition of "seller" that would extend liability to any party responsible for placing a defective product into the stream of commerce, providing a method of recourse for injured consumers that is not reliant on the courts.

J	Seymore, SB				Seymore, Sean B.			The Research Patent	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RIGHTS; UTILITY REQUIREMENT; ECONOMICS; RETHINKING; SCIENCE; NORMS; LAW; INFRINGEMENT; DISCLOSURE; INNOVATION	The patent system gives courts the discretion to tailor patentability standards flexibly across technologies to provide optimal incentives for innovation. For chemical inventions, the courts deem them unpatentable if the chemical lacks a practical, non-research-based use at the time patent protection is sought. The fear is that an early-stage patent on a research input would confer too much control over yet-unknown uses for the chemical, thereby potentially hindering downstream innovation. Yet, denying patents on research inputs can frustrate patent law's broad goal of protecting and promoting scientific and technological advances. This Article addresses this problem by proposing a new form of intellectual property a "research patent." This regime would allow inventors to obtain patents on research inputs and extract their full value through licensing and enforcement. Research patents would impose minimal administrative costs on the patent system and ultimately promote the disclosure, development, and use of early-stage inventions. At a broader level, the proposed regime raises the theoretical question of how allowing patent protection on early-stage inventions like research inputs serves patent law's instrumental justification of promoting scientific progress. It also raises significant normative and policy questions about technology-specific patentability standards and their role in furthering the goals of the patent system.

J	Roe, MJ				Roe, Mark J.			Dodge v. Ford: What Happened and Why?	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							CORPORATE; MARKET	Behind Henry Ford's business decisions that led to the widely taught, famous-in-law-school Dodge v. Ford shareholder primacy decision were three industrial organization structures that put Ford in a difficult business position. First, Ford Motor had a highly profitable monopoly and needed much cash for the just-begun construction of the River Rouge factory, which was said to be the world's largest when completed. Second, to stymie union organizers and to motivate his new assembly-line workers, Henry Ford raised worker pay greatly; Ford could not maintain his monopoly without sufficient worker buy-in. And, third, if Ford explicitly justified his acts as in pursuit of the monopoly profit in the litigation, the Ford brand would have been damaged with both his workforce and the car buyers. The transactions underlying Dodge v. Ford and resulting in the court order that a very large dividend be paid should be reconceptualized as Ford Motor Company and its auto workers splitting the "monopoly rectangle" that Ford Motor's assembly line produced, with Ford's business requiring tremendous cash expenditures to keep and expand that monopoly. Hence, a common interpretation of the litigation setting-that Ford let slip his charitable purpose when he could have won with a business judgment defense should be reconsidered. Ford had a true business purpose to cutting back the dividend-spending on labor and a vertically integrated factory to solidify his monopoly and splitting the monopoly profit with labor-but he would have jeopardized the strategy's effectiveness by boldly articulating it. The existing main interpretations of the corporate law decision and its realpolitik remain relevant-such as Ford seeking to squeeze out the Dodge brothers by cutting the Ford dividend to deny the Dodge brothers cash for their own car company. But those interpretations must take a back seat, as none fully encompasses the industrial setting of monopoly, incipient union organizing, and a restless workforce. Without accounting for Ford Motor's monopoly, the River Rouge construction, and the related labor tensions, we cannot fully understand the Dodge v. Ford controversy. Stakeholder pressure can more readily succeed in a firm having significant economic rents, a setting that seems common today and was true for Ford Motor Company in the 1910s.

J	Coverl, D; Wang, AJ				Coverl, Darcy; Wang, Annie J.			The Loudest Voice at the Supreme Court: The Solicitor General's Dominance of Amicus Oral Argument	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							ADMINISTRATIVE-LAW; CIVIL-RIGHTS; ADVOCACY; OFFICE; CONFESSION; HISTORY; FRIENDS; STATE; RISE	The Solicitor General ("SG") is often called the "Tenth Justice," a title that captures his unique relationship with the Supreme Court and his independence from the executive branch. No phenomenon better reflects this relationship than the Court's practice of permitting amici to participate in oral argument. Although amicus oral argument is nominally available to all litigants, the modern Court grants this privilege almost exclusively to the SG. Scholars and Court watchers have long argued that this practice is justified because the SG uses it to pursue the rule of law and an objective sense of "justice." This Article challenges that account. The SG's dominance of amicus oral argument is a relatively recent phenomenon. In the early 1900s, the SG requested amicus oral argument almost exclusively to defend federal statutes or federal agency action. During this time, the Court granted all his amicus oral argument requests. But, over time, SGs increasingly entered political cases with only tenuous connections to the federal government. During the late 1980s, the Court became skeptical of the SG's political independence; in response, it denied seventeen percent of his amicus oral argument motions, and individual Justices criticized him in internal memoranda. Thirty years later, the Court permits the SG to argue as an amicus in almost any case he wants, even though he increasingly weighs in on politically charged cases with de minimis implications for the federal government. This new equilibrium has profound consequences. By permitting the SG to be heard any time he asks, the Court systematically biases the perspectives that it hears. This bias undermines due process principles and the adversarial system, and it ignores the Court's own history and rules. We offer a proposal for reform.

J	Cohen, KA				Cohen, Katherine A.			Measuring Semantic Relatedness: A Proposal for a New Textual Tool	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article								Judicial decisions, statutes, constitutions, sentencing guidelines, and ERISA-related documents have at least one thing in common: at a molecular level, the laws are all composed of words. The scientific study of linguistics, particularly the field of semantics, analyzes what words mean and how they are connected with each other. And yet, thus far, the legal field has taken little notice of academic and technological breakthroughs in the field of linguistic semantics. This Note seeks to highlight the potential utility of linguistic semantic tools in interpreting legal texts. Specifically, applying algorithms to a free online lexical database allows anyone with a computer to measure the level of relatedness between two nouns. Like more classical and widely accepted textual tools, these algorithms shed light on the plain meaning and semantic nuances of different words. Applying them to two prominent federal circuit splits regarding federal sentencing guidelines and ERISA benefits further underscores their usefulness across the legal discipline. The legal field stands to benefit from employing semantic linguistic algorithms in the law to help resolve semantic ambiguity in legal texts and arrive at more consistent, quantifiable conclusions.

J	Severtson, MR				Severtson, Meredith Rolfs			Let's Talk About Gender: Nonbinary Title VII Plaintiffs Post-Bostock	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article								In Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court held that Title VII's sex-discrimination prohibition applies to discrimination against gay and transgender employees. This decision, surprising from a conservative Court, has engendered a huge amount of commentary on both its substantive holding and its interpretive method. This Note addresses a single question arising from this discourse: After Bostock, how will courts address allegations of sex discrimination by plaintiffs whose gender identities exist outside of traditional sex and gender binaries? As this Note explores, some have argued that Bostock's textualist logic precludes sex-discrimination claims by nonbinary plaintiffs. While such arguments fail to recognize the import of pre-Bostock Title VII jurisprudence, they are worth engaging. Given the history of narrow judicial interpretations of Title VII, the conservative leanings of the federal bench, and the controversial nature of gender-discrimination law, this Note argues that while Title VII protects employees of all gender identities, amending federal law to explicitly prohibit gender-identity discrimination remains a policy priority post-Bostock.

J	Galle, B				Galle, Brian			The Quick (Spending) and the Dead: The Agency Costs of Forever Philanthropy	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							NONPROFIT EXECUTIVE PAY; FOR-PROFIT; GOVERNANCE; ORGANIZATIONS; INVESTMENT; ALTRUISM; CHARITY; LAW	American philanthropic institutions control upwards of a trillion dollars of wealth. Because contributions to these entities are deductible from both income and estate taxes, and the entities' earnings are tax-free, that trillion dollars is heavily underwritten by contemporary taxpayers. Law offers little assurance that those who pay will be those who benefit. To the contrary, since these subsidies become more valuable the longer charitable assets are left unspent, the law strongly encourages philanthropies to save rather than spend, even in situations of great current need. Other legal rules further encourage grantmaking institutions to strive to exist "in perpetuity." This Essay offers new empirical evidence of the social cost of forever philanthropy, that is, of institutions that long outlive their founders. Drawing on a relatively unique dataset of foundation donors, and combining it with a large archive of tax returns filed by private foundations, I search for evidence that managers of long-lasting organizations depart significantly from the preferences of the organization's supporters. I find that a firm's overhead, or the ratio of administrative expenses to grants made, jumps by about 12% as soon as the organization's last living donor dies. Payout rates, or the share of assets spent each year, move sharply in the opposite direction, falling about 7% at that time. I interpret these findings as evidence of substantial agency costs. Since the timing of the donor's death is relatively random, these outcomes offer convincing causal evidence that the ability of a donor to monitor her foundation's managers importantly affects whether those managers follow her wishes. I argue that overhead and payout changes in the directions I observe strongly suggest that managers, once free from direct oversight, are operating the firm for their own comfort and security. Thus, by unnaturally extending the lifespan of foundations, law is encouraging wasteful allocation of taxpayer supported charitable resources. Therefore, I suggest several policy options that would reduce the agencycost problem. Among others, I support maintaining or increasing legal requirements for mandatory distributions by private foundations and closing legal loopholes offered by a relatively new charitable phenomenon, the donor-advised fund.

J	King, JE				King, Jennifer E.			Evisceration of the Right to Appeal: Denial of Individual Responsibility as Actionable Genocide Denial	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							JUSTICE; LAW	Tensions arise during litigation in the international criminal justice system between the practice of the international criminal tribunals, domestic laws, and policy decisions of United Nation ("UN") Member States. One such tension arises between domestic genocide denial laws, which typically criminalize denial of genocide as a strict liability offense, and the preservation of due process for persons convicted of genocide seeking appeal. In theory, denying individual responsibility during the appeal of a conviction by an international tribunal could constitute punishable genocide denial under some domestic laws. This criminalization of the appeal process would violate the due process rights of international criminal defendants, sacrifice the review mechanism ensuring fair trial rights in international criminal tribunals, and affect the legitimacy of international criminal justice. This Note argues for an interdisciplinary solution to combat genocide denial that fully respects due process. First, domestic denial laws should be amended to include an intent requirement to exclude from coverage denial of individual responsibility during litigation. Second, all international and hybrid criminal tribunals should implement safeguards to protect defense counsel and witnesses from domestic prosecution for their role in the appeals process. Third, the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals should clarify its enduring dedication to both reducing denialist behaviors and respecting due process and should call on all states to do the same. Genocide denial is a harmful phenomenon with no place in modern discourse; however, sacrificing full due process rights in the international criminal tribunals does little to reduce the effects of genocide denial.

J	Bratton, WW				Bratton, William W.			Symposium: Conference on Margaret Blair's Contributions to Our Understanding of the Role of Corporations in the Economy	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							AGENCY COSTS; LAW; OWNERSHIP; MARKET; TAKEOVER; ESSAY; FIRM; MYTH	This Article reconsiders Margaret Blair and Lynn Stout's team production model of corporate law, offering a favorable evaluation. The model explains both the legal corporate entity and corporate governance institutions in macroeconomic terms as the means to the end of encouraging investment, situating corporations within markets and subject to market constraints but simultaneously insisting that productive success requires that corporations remain independent of markets. The model also integrates the inherited framework of corporate law into an economically derived model of production, constructing a microeconomic description of large enterprises firmly rooted in corporate doctrine but neither focused on nor limited by a description of principal-agent relationships among shareholders and managers. This Article shows that the model retains descriptive robustness, despite the substantial accretion of shareholder power during the two decades since its appearance. The Article also shows that the model taught three groundbreaking lessons to corporate legal theory. First, nothing binds microeconomic analysis together with a theory of the firm rooted in shareholder primacy. Second, microeconomics, with its emphases on efficiency and maximization, can be deployed in the service of an allocatively sensitive description of corporate governance, providing a more capacious methodological tent than anyone in corporate law understood prior to Blair and Stout's intervention. Third, it is not only possible but arguably necessary to take corporate law seriously when articulating a microeconomic theory of corporate production. To the extent an economic model's description of the appropriate legal framework differs materially from the inherited legal framework, there is a possible, even a probable, infirmity in the model.

J	Squire, R				Squire, Richard			Why the Corporation Locks in Financial Capital but the Partnership Does Not	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							LAW; RISE	Each partner in an at-will partnership can obtain a cash payout of his interest at any time. The corporation, by contrast, locks in shareholder capital, denying general payout rights to shareholders unless the charter states otherwise. What explains this difference? This Article argues that partner payout rights reduce the costs of two other characteristics of the partnership: the non-transferability of partner control rights, and the possibility for partnerships to be formed inadvertently. While these characteristics serve valuable functions, they can introduce a bilateral-monopoly problem and a special freezeout hazard unless each partner can force the firm to cash out his interest. The corporation lacks these characteristics: shares are freely transferable, and no one can commit capital to a corporation without intending to do so. Therefore, in most corporations the costs of shareholder payout rights-which would include the cash-raising burden and a hazard of appraisal arbitrage-would exceed the benefits.

J	Epps, D				Epps, Daniel			Checks and Balances in the Criminal Law	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							SEPARATION; POWERS	The separation of powers is considered essential in the criminal law, where liberty and even life are at stake. Yet the reasons for separating criminal powers are surprisingly opaque, and the "separation of powers" is often used to refer to distinct, and sometimes contradictory, concepts. This Article reexamines the justifications for the separation of powers in criminal law. It asks what is important about separating criminal powers and what values such separation serves. It concludes that in criminal justice, the traditional Madisonian approach of separating powers between functionally differentiated political institutions legislature, executive, and judiciary bears no necessary connection to important values like preserving liberty, preventing tyranny, and safeguarding the rule of law. Not only is adhering to the traditional Madisonian approach to separation of powers insufficient to promote these values, it is likely unnecessary to protect them as well. Instead of the separation of powers, the organizing principle for the structure of the criminal justice system should be the distinct idea of "checks and balances." A checks-and-balances approach would emphasize the diffusion of decisionmaking power among different social and political interests in society; functional duplication and overlapping jurisdiction between different decisionmakers; insulation of decisionmaking power by individual actors within single institutions, along with more formal checking roles for non-state actors; and careful design to optimize electoral accountability.

J	Skinner, CP				Skinner, Christina Parajon			Central Banks and Climate Change	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							UNCERTAINTY; CORPORATION; RISE; LAW	Central banks are increasingly called upon to address climate change. Proposals for central bank action on climate change range from programs of "green" quantitative easing to increases in risk-based capital requirements meant to deter banks from lending to climate-unfriendly business. Politicians and academics alike have urged climate risk as both macroeconomic and financial stability risk. Relative to counterparts abroad, the U.S. central bank-the Federal Reserve-has been more measured in its response. This Article offers a legal explanation why. It urges that, despite the substantive importance of climate change, the U.S. Federal Reserve presently has relatively limited legal authority to address that problem head-on. Drawing on insights from corporate finance and macroeconomics, the Article constructs a legal framework-stitching together a variety of Fed laws, regulations, and precedents of practice-to discern why many aspects of climate change sit outside the Fed's legal remit today. Ultimately, the Article tackles one of the most pressing rule-of-law questions facing the Fed today: What are the limits of the Fed's mandates to address climate change and how far can the Fed press beyond those mandates to make the economy greener? In doing so, the Article prompts reflection on the ideal role of the Fed vis-a-vis the fiscal authority of the Treasury, the political actors in Congress, and the Chief Executive.

J	Maczko, GF				Maczko, Gregory F.			Make Hay While the Sun Shines: Private Equity and the False Claims Act	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							CHALLENGES; MEDICARE	For years, the federal government has used the False Claims Act to police fraud in the healthcare industry. Every year, the Department of Justice recovers billions of dollars from healthcare companies for their False Claims Act violations, both penalizing wrongdoers and providing incentives for whistleblowers to come forward. Over the past decade, however, private equity activity within the healthcare industry has increased significantly, presenting questions as to how the False Claims Act applies when a private equity firm's portfolio company is accused of wrongdoing. This Note analyzes the ambiguity in how different courts have previously applied the False Claims Act to different corporate forms-focusing on the level of involvement required of a parent organization-to determine how the Act should apply to private equity firms going forward, concluding that any direct involvement by a private equity firm in fraud committed by its portfolio company should trigger False Claims Act liability for the private equity firm.

J	Gould, JS				Gould, Jonathan S.			Rethinking Swing Voters	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							SUPREME-COURT; RULE; POLICY; HISTORY; JUSTICE; RIGHTS; HOUSE; BIRTH; LAW	In recent decades, swing voters in courts and legislatures have made many of the United States' most important decisions of law and policy. It would be easy to conclude from the recent history of the Supreme Court and Congress that democracy or majority rule inevitably entails placing many of a society's most important decisions in the hands of swing voters. Far from being inevitable, however, swing voters result from a highly contingent set of circumstances, both ideological and institutional. This Article probes these contingencies, describing and evaluating swing voters and the power they hold. It first explains the conditions under which swing voters will exist and wield power, including an account of why swing voters hold greater power than other pivotal voters. Understanding swing voters requires understanding institutional design and internal procedures: some arrangements increase swing voter prevalence and power, while others have the opposite effect. The ways in which rules construct swing voters give institutional designers and reformers ample tools at their disposal to increase or decrease the prevalence of swing voters and the extent of their power. But nearly any judgment about swing voters and the power they exercise necessarily rests on thorny empirical and normative issues including the relative importance of moderation and stability in different institutions, the performance of swing voters as compared to other voters, and how swing voter power interacts with principles of majority rule. Swing voters are therefore best understood not as ends unto themselves, but as windows into broader issues in democratic theory and institutional design.

The Shadows of Litigation Finance	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION; MARKET-EFFICIENCY; COUNTERPARTY RISK; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; CONTRACT; LAW; INSURANCE; CHOICE; BREACH; ENFORCEMENT	Litigation finance is quickly becoming a centerpiece of our legal system. Once a dispute arises, litigants may seek money from third-party financiers to pay their legal bills or monetize their claims, and in turn those financiers receive a portion of any case proceeds. Yet policymakers are struggling with how to evaluate and regulate litigation finance. There are two problems. The first is an awareness problem. Some commentators consider litigation finance "likely the most important development in civil justice of our time," but others have hardly heard of it. As a result, many policymakers do not quite understand what litigation finance is, how it works, and what is actually new about it. The second problem is analytical. There is no scholarly framework policymakers can rely on to evaluate whether litigation finance is actually good for the legal system and society. Moreover, the existing scholarship has overlooked important welfare effects, risking inefficient and suboptimal regulatory decisionmaking. This Article addresses both problems. First, it articulates what exactly litigation finance is, who uses it, why they use it, and-most importantly-what is (and is not) new about this form of financing. Second, it provides a novel framework for analyzing the welfare implications of litigation finance. Existing scholarship focuses narrowly on the effects of litigation finance on behavior after a claim accrues and a litigant seeks funding. This Article's framework provides new insights by explaining how litigation finance also significantly affects parties' behavior before a legal dispute ever arises. Once these "preclaim" effects of litigation finance are understood alongside the "post-claim" effects that scholars have previously identified, it becomes clear that policymakers should encourage rather than obstruct litigation finance.

J	Yordy, LR				Yordy, Lucas R.			The Library of Babel for Prior Art: Using Artificial Intelligence to Mass Produce Prior Art in Patent Law	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							DISCLOSURE	Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in the invention and innovation processes of our society. To date, though, much of the academic discussion on the interaction of artificial intelligence and the patent system focuses on the patentability of inventions produced by artificial intelligence. Little attention has been paid to organizations that are seeking to use artificial intelligence to defeat the patentability of otherwise patent-worthy inventions by mass producing prior art. This Note seeks to highlight the consequences of allowing mass-produced, AI-generated prior art to render valuable inventions unpatentable. Specifically, this Note concludes that AI-generated prior art decreases the incentive for researchers to disclose valuable knowledge through the patent system without providing an adequate substitute source of such knowledge. This Note also examines a number of patent law doctrines that should, but likely will not, prevent deficient AI-generated prior art from rendering valuable inventions unpatentable. To resolve these issues, this Note proposes a solution that modifies the current novelty inquiry and breathes new life into the patent law doctrine of conception. This solution advances the patent system's purpose of promoting technological advancement while still allowing artificial intelligence to play a large role in that technological advancement.

J	Rushin, S				Rushin, Stephen			Police Arbitration	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							DISCIPLINE	Before punishing an officer for professional misconduct, police departments often provide the officer with an opportunity to file an appeal. In many police departments, this appeals process culminates in a hearing before an arbitrator. While numerous media reports have suggested that arbitrators regularly overturn or reduce discipline, little legal research has comprehensively examined the outcomes of police disciplinary appeals across the United States. In order to better understand the use of arbitration in police disciplinary appeals and build on prior research, this Article draws on a dataset of 624 arbitration awards issued between 2006 and 2020 from a diverse range of law enforcement agencies. It finds that arbitrators on appeal reduced or overturned police officer discipline in 52% of these cases. In 46% of cases involving termination, arbitrators ordered police departments to rehire previously terminated officers. On average, arbitrators reduced the length of officer suspensions by approximately 49%. Arbitrators gave several common justifications for reductions in officer discipline. Frequently, arbitrators found the original discipline to be excessive relative to the offense committed or relative to punishments received by other officers. In a somewhat smaller number of cases, arbitrators cited insufficient evidence or procedural flaws in the investigation or adjudication of the original internal disciplinary process. This Article concludes by considering the implications of these findings for the literature on police accountability. It also considers emerging efforts in states like Minnesota and Oregon to reform police arbitration procedures in order to better balance officers' interests in due process with the public's interest in accountability.

J	Manheim, LM				Manheim, Lisa Marshall			Presidential Control of Elections	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							ADMINISTRATIVE STATE; INDEPENDENT AGENCIES; RIGHTS; ENTRENCHMENT; ACCOUNTABILITY; AUTHORITY	In recent decades, presidents of both political parties have asserted increasingly aggressive forms of influence over the administrative state. During this same period, Congress has expanded the role that the federal government plays in election administration. The convergence of these two trends leads to a troubling but underexamined phenomenon: presidential control of elections. Relying on their official powers, presidents have the ability to affect the rules that govern elections, including elections meant to check and legitimize presidential powers in the first place. This self-serving arrangement heightens the risk of harms from political entrenchment and subordination of expertise. These harms, in turn, threaten to compromise election outcomes. By extension, they also threaten the electoral connection purportedly underlying the administrative state and, therefore, the legitimacy of the work of the modern executive branch. This Article identifies, defines, and examines this phenomenon-presidential control of elections-and explores its broader implications. It demonstrates that, across the executive branch, this phenomenon manifests differently, and sometimes counterintuitively, in ways that tend to track how Congress has structured the relevant grant of power. Three forms dominate, with presidents influencing election administration primarily through priority setting (for grants of power running through executive agencies), promotion of gridlock (for grants of power running through independent agencies), and idiosyncratic control (for grants of power running directly to the president). This analysis reveals that congressional efforts at insulation at times can backfire, with presidents able to exercise particularly problematic forms of control over agencies that Congress designed in blunt ways to resist presidential influence. To that end, this Article proposes that Congress and the courts avoid trying to eliminate or otherwise indiscriminately curb presidential control of elections-a quixotic endeavor that would give rise to its own constitutional challenges and normative harms. Instead, the legislative and judicial branches should identify specific areas where the president's control over election administration lacks an effective check and seek to empower other political actors in those spaces.

J	Klein, PJ				Klein, Peyton J.			Underwater Mortgages for Underwater Homes: The Elimination of Signals in the Coastal Lending Market	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							LEMONS	Climate change and sea level rise threaten to increase the default risk of mortgages on homes in coastal areas. Faced with this reality, small coastal lenders have begun selling more climate-sensitive mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, thereby transferring the risk of climate-induced default off the lenders' books. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a crucial role in supporting America's mortgage finance system by purchasing qualifying private home loans, packaging them into investable security pools, and guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest to outside investors. Through selling mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, lenders can use their increased liquidity to fund additional mortgages. The effectiveness of this process, however, is dependent on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac accepting high-quality loans that carry minimal risks of default. This Note argues that absent some form of intervention, small coastal lenders will likely continue offloading their climate-induced default risk until Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac become so overleveraged that they can no longer ensure a functioning secondary mortgage market and taxpayers are forced to bail them out-akin to the 2008 financial crisis. Further, this Note seeks to frame such harmful lending behavior as a general market failure, and, more specifically, as a variation of the Lemons Problem. Using familiar solutions to the Lemons Problem as guideposts, this Note attempts to curtail the asymmetrical offloading of climate-sensitive loans through a mixture of public and private mechanisms aimed at improving the ability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to incorporate climate risks into loan purchasing decisions.

J	McAuliffe, CM				McAuliffe, Caitlin M.			Creditors, Keepers: Passive Retention of Estate Property and the Automatic Stay	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article								The automatic stay provision is one of the most important provisions in the Bankruptcy Code. Until recently, however, it has remained unclear if passive retention of property of the bankruptcy estate must be immediately turned over to the debtor under the automatic stay provision. The Supreme Court decided in City of Chicago v. Fulton that passive retention does not violate the automatic stay, saving creditors from the consequences of retaining estate property. The debate about the stay, however, is far from over. Many circuit courts were already concerned about the policy issues deriving from the City of Chicago maintaining possession over debtors' vehicles, rendering debtors unable to get to work or pay off their debts during the bankruptcy plan. Justice Sotomayor remains frustrated about these policy concerns and called on Congress to change the Code and enable debtors to be more successful in their payment plans.

J	Sudeall, L; Pasciuti, D				Sudeall, Lauren; Pasciuti, Daniel			Praxis and Paradox: Inside the Black Box of Eviction Court	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							UNREPRESENTED POOR; LEGAL ASSISTANCE; HOUSING COURT; JUSTICE; ACCESS; LIMITS; LAW	In the American legal system, we typically conceive of legal disputes as governed by specific rules and procedures, resolved in a formalized court setting, with lawyers shepherding both parties through an adversarial process involving the introduction of evidence and burdens of proof. The often-highlighted exception to this understanding is the mass, assembly-line processing of cases, whether civil or criminal, in large, urban, lower-level courts. The gap left unfilled by either of these two narratives is how "court" functions for the average unrepresented litigant in smaller and nonurban jurisdictions across the United States. For many tenants facing eviction, elements of the "typical" formal legal process are absent, resulting in an experience that only loosely resembles what is taught in law school. This Article is based on a first-of-its-kind interdisciplinary, multi-year, mixed-methods study of suburban and rural dispossessory (eviction) courts in Georgia that aims to contribute to the knowledge gap described above. Through detailed quantitative analysis of case files and qualitative data gleaned from court observation and stakeholder interviews, and its unique focus on courts outside of a major city, it provides a clearer picture of how eviction court in such jurisdictions operates in practice and what resulting variations in process mean for case outcomes. Ultimately, this Article demonstrates that while one set of laws may govern throughout the state, the process for applying and enforcing those laws is highly localized, dependent on the nature of place and the attitudes of the stakeholders involved. While smaller, lower-volume courts have fewer caseload pressures and appear to prioritize procedural justice, the process they conduct functions less like a traditional legal proceeding and more as a vehicle for rent collection. Paradoxically, elements typically associated with fair process-like the opportunity to respond to legal claims through filing an answer or the scheduling of a hearing on the merits-do not always manifest in substantively improved outcomes for tenants, given the structure of the underlying law. The Article concludes by reflecting on what these observations suggest about the limitations and effectiveness of different forms of legal assistance and how court processes, regardless of their locale and the people who operate within them, can maximize access to justice.

J	Claxton, CM				Claxton, Christina M.			Private Offerings in the Age of Surveillance Capitalism and Targeted Advertising	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							GUIDANCE; AGENCIES; MARKET	Social media platforms, as well as the internet more broadly, have fundamentally altered many aspects of modern life. In particular, platforms' targeted advertising mechanisms have revolutionized how companies reach consumers by providing advertisers more effective tools for reaching consumers and by tailoring content to consumers' individual interests. Advertising, in many respects, has always been targeted-it has always sought to reach and influence a certain set of consumers. Today's targeted advertising, however, allows advertisers to influence consumer behavior on an increasingly granular and intimate level, further skewing the power imbalance between advertisers and consumers. This new dynamic, together with changes to advertising rules for private securities offerings, creates a regulatory gap: should issuers be allowed to promote private offerings through targeted advertising on social media? This Note examines that gap and considers how contemporary targeted advertising mechanisms interact with the law of private securities, which has long restricted issuers' use of advertising in promoting private offerings. These and other restrictions reflect an understanding that private securities are more volatile (and, as a result, often yield higher returns) than public securities. In 2013, though, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission" or "SEC") lifted a longstanding ban on the use of general solicitations for private offerings, paving the way for issuers to employ widely disseminated advertisements to solicit investors. But the Commission did not anticipate-and could not have anticipated-the ways in which social media and "surveillance capitalism" would change advertising, and the current regulatory regime does not contemplate how targeted advertising fits into the private offering landscape. With the ability not only to target but also to influence specific consumers, private securities issuers can wield new power with targeted advertising. Consumers may understandably be enticed by promises of high returns, and advertisements for private offerings can now appear in consumers' social media newsfeed alongside personal and professional content. More importantly, targeted advertising algorithms curate personalized content with the goal of imperceptibly and gradually changing consumer thinking, perhaps leading a user to finally click on an advertisement she once scrolled past. While such a dynamic may be acceptable, and even desirable, with respect to material goods and services, it raises complicated and pressing concerns in the context of private securities offerings. This Note proposes modifications to the private securities rules that would prohibit the use of targeted advertising in private offerings-a change that would adequately remediate the harms posed and provide clarity to the many stakeholders involved.

J	Campbell, N				Campbell, Nathan			The Duty to Update Corporate Emissions Pledges	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; CARBON EMISSIONS; DISCLOSURE; GOVERNANCE; EFFICIENT; CORRECT	Facing both internal and external market pressures, a rapidly growing number of private companies are making public, voluntary, and ambitious pledges to reduce or outright eliminate by a certain date or benchmark their greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, ambition and necessity notwithstanding, nonfulfillment of these emission reduction targets ("ERTs") is a looming, if not an already realized, concern for markets, which are noticeably and increasingly attuned to the long-term value and climate performance of companies. In the absence of a comprehensive disclosure regime for climate performance and risk, this Note highlights the duty to update-a judicial doctrine that polices forward-looking statements, like ERTs, that become misleading over time-as a bulwark against unfulfilled ERTs that linger in the market and have the potential to mislead investors concerning a company's climate performance or reputation. In fact, ERTs-which convey clear expectations regarding the quantity of emissions to be reduced, the steps needed to achieve those reductions, and the timeframe of achievement-are uniquely suitable for the duty to update.

J	Omarova, ST				Omarova, Saule T.			The People's Ledger: How to Democratize Money and Finance the Economy	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							COMMERCIAL PAPER; TOO BIG; FINTECH; BANKING; CRISIS	The COVID-19 crisis underscored the urgency of digitizing sovereign money and ensuring universal access to banking services. It pushed two related ideas-the issuance of central bank digital currency and the provision of retail deposit accounts by central banks-to the forefront of the public policy debate. To date, however, the debate has not produced a coherent vision of how democratizing access to central bank money would-and should-transform and democratize the entire financial system. This lack of a systemic perspective obscures the enormity of the challenge and dilutes our ability to tackle it. This Article takes up that challenge. It offers a blueprint for a comprehensive restructuring of the central bank balance sheet as the basis for redesigning the core architecture of modern finance. Focusing on the U.S. Federal Reserve System ("the Fed"), the Article outlines a series of structural reforms that would radically redefine the role of a central bank as the ultimate public platform for generating, modulating, and allocating financial resources in a democratic economy-the People's Ledger. On the liability side of the ledger, the Article envisions the complete migration of demand deposit accounts to the Fed's balance sheet and explores the full range of new, more direct and more flexible, monetary policy tools enabled by this shift. On the asset side, it advocates a comprehensive qualitative restructuring of the Fed's investment portfolio, which would maximize its capacity to channel credit to productive uses in the nation's economy. This compositional overhaul of the Fed's balance sheet would fundamentally alter the operations and systemic footprints of private banks, funds, derivatives dealers, and other financial institutions and markets. Analyzing these structural implications, the Article shows how the proposed reforms would make the financial system less complex, more stable, and more efficient in serving the long-term needs of the American people.

J	Wells, H				Wells, Harwell			The Personification of the Partnership	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							LAW; LEGAL; ACT; CORPORATION; LIABILITY; PURPOSE; ORIGINS; SCOPE; RISE	What does it mean to say a business association is a legal person? The question has shadowed the law of business organizations for at least two centuries. When we say a business is a legal person we may be claiming that the law distinguishes its assets, liabilities, and obligations from those of its owners; or that it has a "real will" and personality apart from its owners; or that it in some way can carry or assert rights generally ascribed to natural persons. This Article sheds new light on these old questions by looking at an oft-overlooked business form, the partnership, and at once-fierce debates over just what the partnership is. In the decades around the turn of the twentieth century scholars and practitioners hotly debated whether the partnership was an "aggregate" or "entity" and whether the law should treat it as a separate legal person, debates which culminated in the drafting of the Uniform Partnership Act (1914). Central to these disputes was a now-forgotten facet of legal personhood: the moral consequences of treating a business association as a distinct legal person.

J	Cheffins, BR; Williams, R				Cheffins, Brian R.; Williams, Richard			Team Production Theory Across the Waves	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							SHAREHOLDER PRIMACY; CORPORATE-LAW; COMPANY LAW; STATUTORY; LIABILITY	Team production theory, which Margaret Blair developed in tandem with Lynn Stout, has had a major impact on corporate law scholarship. The team production model, however, has been applied sparingly outside the United States. This article, part of a symposium honoring Margaret Blair's scholarship, serves as a partial corrective by drawing on team production theory to assess corporate arrangements in the United Kingdom. Even though Blair and Stout are dismissive of "shareholder primacy" and the U.K is thought of as a "shareholder-friendly" jurisdiction, deploying team production theory sheds light on key corporate law topics such as directors' duties and the allocation of managerial authority. In particular, the case study offered here shows that board centrality a key element of team production thinking features prominently in U.K corporate governance despite Britain's shareholder-oriented legal framework. The case study also draws attention to the heretofore neglected role that private ordering can play in the development of team production-friendly governance arrangements.

J	Burset, CR				Burset, Christian R.			Advisory Opinions and the Problem of Legal Authority	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							JUDICIAL POWER; FEDERAL-COURTS; ARTICLE III; COMMON-LAW; JUDGES; EXAMPLE; CONSTITUTION; AVOIDANCE; HISTORY; NATIONS	The prohibition against advisory opinions is fundamental to our understanding of federal judicial power, but we have misunderstood its origins. Discussions of the doctrine begin not with a constitutional text or even a court case, but a letter in which the Jay Court rejected President Washington's request for legal advice. Courts and scholars have offered a variety of explanations for the Jay Court's behavior. But they all depict the earliest Justices as responding to uniquely American concerns about advisory opinions. This Article offers a different explanation. Drawing on previously untapped archival sources, it shows that judges throughout the anglophone world-not only in the United States but also in England and British India-became opposed to advisory opinions in the second half of the eighteenth century. The death of advisory opinions was a global phenomenon, rooted in a period of anxiety about common-law authority. Early modern English judges had routinely advised the Crown. This advisory role was politically fraught but doctrinally unproblematic thanks to a jurisprudential orthodoxy that treated judges' opinions as evidence of a preexisting common law. Although this declaratory theory survived into the nineteenth century (and beyond), it began to fragment after 1750, as lawyers began to disagree about the nature of precedent. Those disagreements generated new pressure to clarify the weight of different kinds of legal authority. Most lawyers intuited that advisory opinions were less authoritative than decisions arising from litigation. But because bench and bar lacked a common theory of legal authority, they were unable to articulate a shared understanding of what respect was due to judges' extrajudicial pronouncements. As a result, advisory opinions became dangerous, because the judges who issued them could not control how future readers might treat them. In response, judges sought to limit their advisory activity-first in England, then in British-controlled Bengal, and finally in the United States, whose judges inherited Britain's contested and dynamic understanding of the judicial role.

J	Bressman, LS; Stack, KM				Bressman, Lisa Schultz; Stack, Kevin M.			Chevron Is a Phoenix	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							LAW; DEFERENCE	Judicial deference to agency interpretations of their own statutes is a foundational principle of the administrative state. It recognizes that Congress has the need and desire to delegate the details of regulatory policy to agencies rather than specify those details or default to judicial determinations. It also recognizes that interpretation under regulatory statutes is intertwined with implementation of those statutes. Prior to the famous decision in Chevron, the Supreme Court had long regarded judicial deference as a foundational principle of administrative law. It grew up with the administrative state alongside other foundational administrative law principles. In Chevron, the Court gave judicial deference a particular articulation and set of express justifications that made the principle seem new and bold-and ultimately set it on a path to become convoluted and vulnerable. But judicial deference is no less a foundational principle because Chevron took on a life of its own. And foundational principles-particularly those that help to maintain balance among the branches-do not simply go away. They change and reappear in the law. The Court can try to kill Chevron, but judicial deference will find its way back to administrative law.

J	Littman, A				Littman, Aaron			Jails, Sheriffs, and Carceral Policymaking	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							CRIMINAL-JUSTICE; MASS INCARCERATION; PRISON; PUNISHMENT; PRIVATE; CRIME; COSTS; STATE; EMPLOYMENT; DISCRETION	The machinery of mass incarceration in America is huge, intricate, and destructive. To understand it and to tame it, scholars and activists look for its levers of power-where are they, who holds them, and what motivates them? This much we know: legislators criminalize, police arrest, prosecutors charge, judges sentence, prison officials confine, and probation and parole officials manage release. As this Article reveals, jailers, too, have their hands on the controls. The sheriffs who run jails-along with the county commissioners who fund them-have tremendous but unrecognized power over the size and shape of our criminal legal system, particularly in rural areas and for people accused or convicted of low-level crimes. Because they have the authority to build jails (or not) as well as the authority to release people (or not), they exercise significant control not merely over conditions but also over both the supply of and demand for jail bedspace: how large they should be, how many people they should confine, and who those people should be. By advocating, financing, and contracting for jail bedspace, sheriffs and commissioners determine who has a say and who has a stake in carceral expansion and contraction. Through their exercise of arrest and release powers, sheriffs affect how many and which people fill their cells. Constraints they create or relieve on carceral infrastructure exert or alleviate pressure on officials at the local, state, and federal levels. Drawing on surveys of state statutes and of municipal securities filings, data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, case law, and media coverage, this Article tells overlooked stories-of sheriffs who send their deputies out door knocking to convince voters to support a new tax to fund a new jail, and of commissioners who raise criminal court fees and sign contracts to detain "rental inmates" to ensure that incarceration "pays for itself." It also tells of sheriffs who override the arrest decisions of city police officers, release defendants who have not made bail, and cut sentences short-and of those who would rather build more beds than push back on carceral inertia. A spotlight on jails and the officials who run them illuminates important attributes of our carceral crisis. The power and incentives to build jail bedspace are as consequential as the power and incentives to fill it. Expanding a county's jailing capacity has profound ramifications across local, state, and federal criminal legal systems. Sheriffs have a unique combination of controls over how big and how full their jails are, but this role consolidation does not produce the restraint that some have predicted. Their disclaimers of responsibility are a smokescreen, obscuring sheriffs' bureaucratic commitment to perpetuating mass incarceration. State courts and federal agencies have increasingly recognized and regulated public profiteering through jail contracting, and advocates have begun to hold jailers accountable, challenging expansion in polling booths and budget meetings.

J	Pollman, E				Pollman, Elizabeth			Corporate Personhood and Limited Sovereignty	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							LAW; GOVERNMENT; FREEDOM; ORIGINS	This Article, written for a symposium celebrating the work of Professor Margaret Blair, examines how corporate rights jurisprudence helped to shape the corporate form in the United States during the nineteenth century. It argues that as the corporate form became popular because of the way it facilitated capital lock-in, perpetual succession, and provided other favorable characteristics related to legal personality that separated the corporation from its participants, the Supreme Court provided crucial reinforcement of these entity features by recognizing corporations as rights-bearing legal persons separate from the government. Although the legal personality of corporations is a distinct concept from their constitutional treatment, the Court's nineteenth-century rulings bolstered key features created by corporate law and simultaneously situated the corporation as subordinate to the state in a system of federalism. And, finally, the Article suggests that the balance of power struck in the first century of Supreme Court jurisprudence on corporate rights has been eroded in the modern era. The Supreme Court's failure to develop a consistent approach to corporate rights questions and its tendency to reason based on views of corporations as associations of persons have exposed a significant flaw in the Court's evolving corporate personhood jurisprudence: it lacks a limiting principle.

J	Menand, L				Menand, Lev			Why Supervise Banks? The Foundations of the American Monetary Settlement	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							COST; CORPORATION; FINANCE	Administrative agencies are generally designed to operate at arm's length, making rules and adjudicating cases. But the banking agencies are different: they are designed to supervise. They work cooperatively with banks and their remedial powers are so extensive they rarely use them. Oversight proceeds through informal, confidential dialogue. Today, supervision is under threat: banks oppose it, the banking agencies restrict it, and scholars misconstrue it. Recently, the critique has turned legal. Supervision's skeptics draw on a uniform, flattened view of administrative law to argue that supervision is inconsistent with norms of due process and transparency. These arguments erode the intellectual and political foundations of supervision. They also obscure its distinguished past and deny its continued necessity. This Article rescues supervision and recovers its historical pedigree. It argues that our current understanding of supervision is both historically and conceptually blinkered. Understanding supervision requires understanding the theory of banking motivating it and revealing the broader institutional order that depends on it. This Article terms that order the "American Monetary Settlement" ("AMS"). The AMS is designed to solve an extremely difficult governance problem-creating an elastic money supply. It uses specially chartered banks to create money and supervisors to act as outsourcers, overseeing the managers who operate banks. Supervision is now under increasing pressure due to fundamental changes in the political economy of finance. Beginning in the 1950s, the government started to allow nonbanks to expand the money supply, devaluing the banking franchise. Then, the government weakened the link between supervision and money creation by permitting banks to engage in unrelated business activities. This transformation undermined the normative foundations of supervisory governance, fueling today's desupervisory movement. Desupervision, in turn, cedes public power to private actors and risks endemic economic instability.

J	Fletcher, GGS				Fletcher, Gina-Gail S.			Deterring Algorithmic Manipulation	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article							DETERRENCE; CRIME; IMPRISONMENT; AMBIGUITY; LIABILITY; POLICY; LAW; AGE	Does the existing anti-manipulation framework effectively deter algorithmic manipulation? With the dual increase of algorithmic trading and the occurrence of "mini-flash crashes" in the market linked to manipulation, this question has become more pressing in recent years. In the past thirty years, the financial markets have undergone a sea change as technological advancements and innovations have fundamentally altered the structure and operation of the markets. Key to this change is the introduction and dominance of trading algorithms. Whereas initial algorithmic trading relied on preset electronic instructions to execute trading strategies, new technology is introducing artificially intelligent ("AI") trading algorithms that learn dynamically from data and respond intuitively to market changes. These technological developments have exposed significant shortcomings in the effectiveness of anti-manipulation laws, particularly regarding one of their fundamental goals: deterring market manipulation. Preventing manipulation remains a key feature of the legal regime governing the financial markets. Rampant manipulation undermines the viability of the market and, in the case of algorithmic manipulation, increases systemic risks within the market. Deterring algorithmic manipulation is thus essential to the viability and stability of the market. But credible and effective deterrence of wrongdoing requires certainty of punishment, which is increasingly unattainable with respect to algorithmic manipulation under the existing legal regime. Specifically, the law of manipulation tethers liability to scienter, which algorithms cannot legally form. Further, deciphering the intent of the human behind the algorithm can be a near-impossible task in all but the most egregious cases. The scienter-focused nature of the anti-manipulation framework therefore diminishes the disciplinary power of the law, weakening deterrence and incentivizing algorithmic manipulation. This Article demonstrates that the scienter-centric analysis undergirding anti-manipulation laws creates gaps in the detection and punishment of algorithmic manipulation that weaken the current legal regime's deterrent effect. The acute failure of the law to punish algorithmic manipulation incentivizes potential wrongdoers to utilize algorithms to cloak their misdeeds, exposing the markets to significant systemic harm. Notably, unlike other scholars and policymakers that view transparency as the ultimate solution to increase accountability for algorithms, this Article highlights the potential limitations of relying primarily on transparency. Rather, the Article urges changes to the legal framework to modernize its applicability: eschew the scienter requirement and, instead, focus on the resulting harm of the algorithm on the market. Together, these proposals are likely to credibly deter algorithmic manipulation, safeguarding the viability, efficiency, and stability of the markets.

J	Sellers, JS; Michalski, R				Sellers, Joshua S.; Michalski, Roger			Democracy on a Shoestring	VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW			English	Article								Democracy requires money. Voters must be registered, voting rolls updated, election dates advertised, voting technology purchased and tested, poll workers trained, ballots designed, votes counted and verified, and on and on. Despite the importance of election expenditures, we have a shamefully inadequate amount of information about how much our elections cost. This Article, based on a novel and painstakingly hand-coded dataset, provides much needed information on election expenditures across multiple years from four states: California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida. These states, given their unique characteristics, provide a compelling sample set. In what we believe to be a completely novel approach to the collection of election expenditure data, we supplement our hand-coded data with predictive machine learning. This allows us to estimate average annual election spending across multiple government units. Our findings, unsurprisingly, reveal great variation both across and within states. But our findings also reveal that much of the variation is seemingly unconnected to poverty, race, and other traditional explanations of electoral disadvantage. This brings into question many basic assumptions legislators, courts, and scholars harbor about election expenditures. Our findings implicate not only policy discussions about election funding but also the limitations of doctrinal interventions and judicial remedies that are divorced from issues of resource allocation. The Article proceeds in five parts: Part I provides background on election funding, including a discussion of election costs and what the most common funding sources are. This Part also discusses election law doctrines and how they do not directly consider election expenditures. Part II outlines our data and methods. Part III presents our main findings. Part IV responds to the findings and explores potential doctrines under which election expenditures might be considered. Part V weighs the pros and cons of several nondoctrinal proposals for election administration reform.
