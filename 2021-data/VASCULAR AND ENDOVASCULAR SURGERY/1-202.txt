A Novel Model of Tobacco Smoke-Mediated Aortic Injury	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						aortic aneurysm; vascular smooth muscle cell; tobacco smoke; elastin	SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; ANEURYSM; SURVEILLANCE; PREVALENCE; CIGARETTES; REPAIR	Objective Tobacco smoke exposure is a major risk factor for aortic aneurysm development. However, the initial aortic response to tobacco smoke, preceding aneurysm formation, is not well understood. We sought to create a model to determine the effect of solubilized tobacco smoke (STS) on the thoracic and abdominal aorta of mice as well as on cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Methods Tobacco smoke was solubilized and delivered to mice via implanted osmotic minipumps. Twenty male C57BL/6 mice received STS or vehicle infusion. The descending thoracic, suprarenal abdominal, and infrarenal abdominal segments of the aorta were assessed for elastic lamellar damage, smooth muscle cell phenotype, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Cultured HASMCs grown in media containing STS were compared to cells grown in standard media in order to verify our in vivo findings. Results Tobacco smoke solution caused significantly more breaks in the elastic lamellae of the thoracic and abdominal aorta compared to control solution (P< .0001) without inciting an inflammatory infiltrate. Elastin breaks occurred more frequently in the abdominal aorta than the thoracic aorta (P < .01). Exposure to STS-induced aortic microdissections and downregulation of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Treatment of cultured HASMCs with STS confirmed the decrease in alpha-SMA expression. Conclusion Delivery of STS via osmotic minipumps appears to be a promising model for investigating the early aortic response to tobacco smoke exposure. The initial effect of tobacco smoke exposure on the aorta is elastic lamellar damage and downregulation of (alpha-SMA) expression by VSMCs. Elastic lamellar damage occurs more frequently in the abdominal aorta than the thoracic aorta and does not seem to be mediated by the presence of macrophages or other inflammatory cells.

J	Ciancio, G				Ciancio, Gaetano			Inferior Vena Cava Reconstruction Using a Ringed Polytetrafluoroethylene Interposition Graft and Inferior Vena Cava Filter Placement Following Resection of Renal Cell Carcinoma With a Tumor Thrombus Directly Infiltrating the Inferior Vena Cava	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						renal cell carcinoma; tumor thrombus; IVC; reconstruction	SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; REPLACEMENT; CANCER	Background Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with tumor thrombus (TT) may extend into and, in rare cases, actually invade the inferior vena cava (IVC). Techniques of IVC reconstruction after removal of the RCC, TT, and infiltrated portion of the IVC have not been well documented. Methods A ringed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) interposition graft along with an IVC filter placed within the graft (to prevent the development of pulmonary emboli) was used for patients who underwent surgical resection of RCC with TT extending into and directly invading the wall of the IVC. Demographic information about these patients along with their pathology reports, surgical procedures, and patency of the PTFE graft was obtained and described. Results Four male patients were identified as having RCC and TT with histologic invasion of the IVC requiring IVC dissection and replacement with a PTFE graft (as described above); their TT levels were II, IIIa, IIIc, and IV, respectively. Patient ages were 58, 65, 58, and 51 years and tumor sizes were 7.5, 7.5, 15.0, and 6.5 cm, respectively. These patients were followed for 36, 24, 32, and 48 months, respectively. At last follow-up, each patient had a patent IVC graft, and none of them developed any pulmonary emboli post-operatively. Conclusions Ringed PTFE interposition graft along with an IVC filter deployed inside the graft appears to be a safe vascular conduit for IVC reconstruction after surgical resection of RCC with TT directly invading the IVC.

The ability to evaluate these parameters could vastly improve the clinical treatment of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. The objective of this study was to develop and demonstrate a methodology to analyze the fluid dynamics that cause the wall stress distribution in abdominal aortic aneurysms, using accurate 3D geometry and a realistic, nonlinear, elastic biomechanical model using a computer-aided software. Methods: The geometry of the abdominal aortic aneurysm; was constructed on a 3D scale using computer-aided software SolidWorks (Dassault Systems SolidWorksCorp., Waltham MA). Due to the complex nature of the abdominal aortic aneurysm geometry, the physiological forces and constraints acting on the abdominal aortic aneurysm wall were measured by using a simulation setup using boundary conditions and initial conditions for different studies such as finite element analysis or computational fluid dynamics. Results: The flow pattern showed an increase velocity at the angular neck, followed by a stagnated flow inside the aneurysm sack. Furthermore, the wall shear stress analysis showed to focalized points of higher stress, the top and bottom of the aneurysm sack, where the flow collides against the wall. An increase of the viscosity showed no significant velocity changed but results in a slight increase in overall pressure and wall shear stress. Conclusions: Conducting computational fluid dynamics modeling of the abdominal aortic aneurysm using computer-aided software SolidWorks (Dassault Systems SolidWorksCorp., Waltham MA) proves to be an insightful approach for the clinical setting. The careful consideration of the biomechanics of the abdominal aortic aneurysm may lead to an improved, case-specific prediction of the abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture potential, which could significantly improve the clinical management of these patients.

Methods: A prospectively maintained database of 42 patients with EVAR-unfavorable anatomy treated by EVAS combined with chimney grafts in case of the proximal AAA neck shorter than 5 mm was analyzed. Early outcomes included final angiographic result, intra- and early post-operative deaths, and complications. Mid-term outcomes included all-cause mortality (ACM), aneurysm-related mortality (ARM), patency of the stents, occurrence of endoleaks, serious complications and graft failures defined as the AAA growth of more than 5 mm, type I endoleak, occlusion of the stent-graft or chimney graft, aorto-duodenal fistula, or aneurysm rupture. Results: The procedure was completed in all patients. Twenty-eight chimney grafts were implanted in 19 patients. Patients were followed for a median of 24 months (range 12-34 months). There were 2 intraoperative ruptures and 1 patient died in an early postoperative period. The cumulative ACM was 15, 21, and 36% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively, and the cumulative ARM was 8, 11, and 27% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. Three out of 5 aneurysm-related deaths were due to a secondary aorto-duodenal fistula. The cumulative incidence of graft failure was 20, 27, and 42% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. The cumulative incidence of an endoleak was 5, 9, and 23% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. The graft failure increased significantly both ACM (p = .012) and ARM (p = .00003). The implantation of chimney grafts at the initial procedure increased ARM significantly (p = .008). The presence of an endoleak did not have any significant influence on ACM and ARM. Conclusion: Patients treated with EVAS for AAAs with EVAR-unfavorable anatomy, especially those with chimney grafts, exhibit a high risk of graft failure and subsequent death.

Bilateral Acute Lower Limb Ischemia Secondary to COVID-19	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						COVID-19; thrombosis; acute ischemic limb		COVID-19 has to date affected over 5 million people worldwide and caused in excess of 300000 deaths. One of the principal finding is that of a thrombotic tendency within the lungs leading to high mortality. There have been increasing number of reports of peripheral arterial thrombosis as well. Most cases of arterial thrombosis is noted in patient in intensive care setting. Here-in we report a case of acute bilateral lower limb arterial thrombosis in a patient recovering at home with mild COVID-19 symptoms, highlighting that patients with milder symptoms may also suffer from prothrombotic state resulting in acute arterial occlusions. Arterial thrombosis should be suspected in these patients despite the absence of predisposing factors.	[Veerasuri, Sowmya; Kulkarni, Sachin R.; Wilson, William R.; Paravastu, Sharath C.

Predictors of Decline in Renal Function 5 Years after EVAR	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair; long-term renal function; gender	ENDOVASCULAR ANEURYSM REPAIR; INFRARENAL FIXATION; GENDER; NEPHROPATHY; RISK	Introduction While there exists copious short-term data regarding renal function following infra-renal endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), long-term analysis is sparse. This is a single institution retrospective review of predictors of renal function decline 5 years after elective EVAR. Methods All EVAR between 2007 and 2015 were queried. Patients in whom renal function was documented 5 years postoperatively were included in analysis. Exclusion criteria were ruptured aneurysm, mortality before 56 months, lack of follow-up, ESRD status, and concomitant renal intervention. The primary outcome investigated was a 20% or greater drop in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 5 years postoperatively. The following variables at the time of surgery were investigated as potential predictors: age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, CAD or prior MI, COPD, prior stroke, baseline eGFR under 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), supra-renal fixation, infra-renal fixation, neck diameter, neck length, and number of contrast CT. Results 354 EVAR were identified of which 143 met inclusion criteria (211 excluded). Univariate analysis revealed female gender (OR 2.7), hypertension (OR 9.4), baseline renal insufficiency (OR 3.8), larger neck diameter, and supra-renal fixation (OR 2.32) all predictive (P < .05) of GFR drop at 5 years. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis found female gender (multivariate OR 3.9, P = .023) and baseline renal insufficiency (multivariate OR 3.0, P = .029) as significant predictors of greater than 20% GFR drop at 5 years. Only 2 patients of the 143 progressed to dialysis requirement at 5 years. Conclusions Females and patients with baseline renal insufficiency are more vulnerable to significant decline in renal function 5 years following EVAR. Consistent with analogous literature, supra-renal fixation appears moderately deleterious toward renal function with no clinical significance in those with baseline normal renal function. The potential benefit of avoidance of supra-renal fixation in female patients with baseline renal insufficiency is worth further investigation in a more robust multi-center study.

A novel alternative treatment intervention for acute intra-abdominal arterial thrombus is the use of stent retriever (SR) devices, tools traditionally applied for treatment of acute vascular thrombosis in stroke patients.

We report a case of ruptured thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) in a morbidly obese 71-year-old man. The patient was admitted with a stable hemodynamic state. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed a contained ruptured TAAA with an occluded celiac trunk and left renal artery due to previous nephrectomy. Due to the emergency and his comorbidities, we performed an endovascular aortic repair with the sandwich technique and 2 chimneys. Two bridging stents (chimneys) were deployed between the aorta and the target vessels (superior mesenteric and right renal arteries) in a space created in-between 2 aortic straight endografts. Ten days postoperative, acute renal failure appeared and right renal stent occlusion was diagnosed on CTA. Unfortunately, no adequate kidney revascularization could be obtained, requiring permanent hemodialysis. At a 3-month follow-up visit, the patient did well with stable aneurysm dimensions. Conclusions: encouraging outcomes of chimney-EVAR techniques, comparable to those in published reports of fenestrated-EVAR and branched-EVAR, support this procedure as a valid off-the-shelf available alternative in emergency situations. Nevertheless, only few midterm results achieved are actually available and long-term outcomes are actually unknown.

Methods A total of 123 endovascular therapy (EVT) procedures were performed in 59 patients (65 limbs) with ultrasound-guided repeat access and repeat implantation of an ExoSeal vascular closure system between January 2019 and March 2021. The procedural details and postprocedural outcomes of EVT with repeat access and use of ExoSeal (RE group) were compared with those of EVT with initial use of ExoSeal (IE group) in the same patients. In a subgroup analysis, these outcomes were also compared in early repeat (within 3 months) and late repeat (over 3 months) cases. Results The technical success rate of ultrasound-guided access in the RE group was 100%. The procedural success rate of EVT and deployment success rate of ExoSeal in the RE group were 93% and 94%, respectively, which were not significantly different to those in the IE group. Access site complications in the RE group occurred in 2 cases (2%), again with no significant difference with the IE group. The median puncture, procedural, and hemostasis times in the RE group were 3 [2-5], 36.5 [29-54], and 7 [5-10] min, respectively, which were not significantly longer than those in the IE group. In the RE group, early and late repeat closure was performed in 66 (54%) and 57 (46%) cases, respectively, and there were no significant differences in the technical success of ultrasound-guided access, procedural success of EVT, deployment success of ExoSeal, and access site complication rates in these cases. Conclusions Ultrasound-guided access facilitated higher technical success of repeat access and fewer access site complications in EVT with repeat use of ExoSeal, regardless of the interval between procedures.

Current practice involves dealing with most cases using endovascular techniques. However, open repair remains superior in terms of the patency rates and may be the only valid option in a subgroup of patients who are unsuitable for endovascular treatments. Most of the current data investigating open procedures are now historic. The aim of this study is to determine whether it is a feasible option in the current day practice. Patients and methods: Ten years data from 2010 to 2020 were collected retrospectively from the hospital records. Clinic letters, radiologic scans, operative records and discharge letters were reviewed. Death records were reviewed to identify patients who survived. Results: Ten cases were identified. The average age was 55 and the mean BMI was 29.4. The mean hospital stay in days was 12 (range: 4 to 22). The mean follow-up period was 147 days (range: 30 to 360 days). Four of the patients were TASC B, four were TASC C and two were TASC D. Two cases had to return to theatres. One patient had transient post-op AF and another had transient post-op ileus. One patient was readmitted within 30 days of discharge for urosepsis. All cases are alive to date except one case which only survived three years after procedure. Conclusion: AE is a procedure that should be considered in selected cases where endovascular approach is not feasible. There is a trend towards lower mortality than the historic data available in literature. Larger case series or registry data may be required to accurately estimate the current day mortality and morbidity figures.

Herein, we report a case of right PVA with severe pulmonary embolism in a 75-year-old woman who presented with sudden chest tightness and dyspnea. Clinical examination revealed hypotension and hypoxemia. Radiographic investigations revealed extensive pulmonary embolism and right fusiform PVA. Following thrombolysis, her blood pressure and oxygen saturation normalized. However, she developed right calf swelling, and angiography revealed a thrombus in the right PVA, which was managed by catheter-directed thrombolysis. Thereafter, a vascular bypass was performed using the left great saphenous vein as a conduit to treat recurrent thrombosis. Subsequent venography indicated a patent vein graft, acceptable blood flow velocity, no thrombosis residue, and no significant thrombosis. Follow-ups at 3, 6, and 12 months revealed satisfactory outcomes. In conclusion, if the systemic condition is conducive, a surgical resection and reconstruction of the popliteal vein is recommended for the treatment of PVAs.

We present a patient with a ruptured giant pseudoaneurysm that we occluded using a modified internal trapping technique with low-concentration N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and a minimum number of coils. An 80-year-old man with a history of chemoradiation therapy for oropharyngeal cancer presented with several episodes of active bleeding from the subsequent tracheostomy site. Radiological examination revealed a giant right common carotid artery (CCA) pseudoaneurysm. Endovascular internal trapping was performed using both NBCA and coils under proximal flow control. We slowly injected 9 ml of low-concentration NBCA, which subsequently filled the entire pseudoaneurysm. We then injected an additional 2 ml of NBCA into the proximal CCA to achieve complete obliteration. No re-bleeding was observed during the 6-month follow-up. Endovascular internal trapping using low-concentration NBCA was feasible to treat a giant CCA pseudoaneurysm. The injected low-concentration NBCA filled the entire pseudoaneurysm without the risk of catheter entrapment.

The classical clinical symptoms of ilio-iliac AVF include high-output heart failure, abdominal pain, abdominal bruits and thrills, a pulsatile abdominal mass, and venous congestion symptoms (leg edema and hematuria). The prompt repair of AVF is necessary to restore the patient's hemodynamics.

False lumen embolization is a useful method to promote thrombosis of false lumen. In the case presented here, direct penetration of the dissected membrane was employed to obtain access to the false lumen, enabling embolization. Case report: The case was a 64-year-old female who developed a Stanford type A acute aortic dissection. Replacement of ascending aorta and aortic arch with frozen elephant trunk technique was performed. After the operation, there was a residual flow through the false lumen in the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta. Twenty months later, the patient complained of sudden back pain, and a CT scan demonstrated another new dissection at the distal edge of the open stent. Additionally, the false lumen that had remained since the onset of the type A aortic dissection enlarged during the observation period. An endovascular procedure was planned to exclude the false lumen. Despite closing all communicating channels between true and false lumen using a vascular plug, coils, and stent grafts, the false lumen continued to expand due to the residual flow at the visceral segment. The origin responsible for the flow was not identified. To perform an embolization of the false lumen, access into the false lumen was obtained by penetration of the dissected flap using a trans-septal needle. Following the successful penetration of the flap, embolization of the false lumen was performed using coils and glue. After the embolization, an angiogram of the false lumen confirmed the significant reduction of leakage into the true lumen. The size of the aorta and false lumen decreased after the embolization. Conclusion: Direct penetration of the dissected membrane of the aorta was a safe and useful measure for regaining access to the false lumen and for the following endovascular intervention.

Methods: A retrospective, single centre analysis of 301 patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia involving the infrainguinal segment was conducted between September 2014 and September 2018, after approval from the Institutional review board. We analyzed clinical outcomes by measuring postoperative ABI improvement, restenosis requiring reintervention procedure, minor and major amputations at the end of 18 months. . To find the association between the group variables (POBA and DCB) and other risk variables, Chi-square test/Fisher's exact test was used. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used. Results: Patients who underwent treatment with plain balloon (POBA) and DCB(Paclitaxel) angioplasty were 246(81.7%) and 55(18.3%) respectively. Our study group was predominantly male (Male: Female = 6.7:1), most patients were more than 50 years of age (n = 251, 83.4%). Smoking (n = 199, 66.1%) and diabetes (n = 210, 69.8%) were the most common atherosclerotic risk factors. Postoperative Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABI) improvement were similar in both groups (POBA = 57.7%; DCB = 69.8%; p = 0.103). Minor and major amputations following POBA were 26% and 22%; and DCB were 12.7% and 16.4% respectively. Re-stenosis requiring a re-interventional procedure within 18 months was 15%, (n = 37) following POBA; and 12.7% (n = 7) following DCB (p = 0.661). Conclusions: This retrospective study shows similar clinical limb related outcomes following POBA and DCB at 18 months. However, our comparative analysis between the POBA and DCB groups was totally unadjusted and not adjusted for common confounders such as age and sex. Hence, for one to draw definitive conclusions leading to changes in clinical practice; a randomized, prospective study with a larger patient cohort is needed.

A 48-year-old female patient presented for a planned right nephrectomy by the urology service secondary to xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. This was complicated by inadvertent resection of an 8 cm segment of the infrarenal IVC. Postoperatively, the patient did not tolerate IVC ligation due to severe lower extremity edema. She then underwent reconstruction with a bovine pericardium conduit as an interposition graft. The post-operative course was complicated by pulmonary embolism requiring percutaneous intervention. This report addresses the utility of bovine pericardium for IVC reconstruction in an infected field.

We present herein a case of duodenal obstruction (DO) which occurred following an EVAS treatment for the repair of an AAA. A 77-year old man was admitted to our hospital with acute abdominal pain and recurrent vomiting. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a retroperitoneal 66 x 59 x 90 mm (antero-posterior, AP; latero-lateral, LL; cranio-caudal: CC) solid mass located in the epigastrium, corresponding to the infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm sac, previously treated by EVAS. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, which revealed a retroperitoneal mass compressing the third and fourth parts of the duodenum. A gastroenteroanastomosis was performed in order to bypass the duodenal obstruction. An extensive search of biomedical literature databases was conducted to identify similar cases. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of DO following an AAA repair with EVAS.

Methods: Between January 2019 and November 2019, 5 patients were diagnosed with acute type B aortic syndrome and ARSA (4 patients with intramural hematoma and ARSA, 1 patient with type B aortic dissection and ARSA). All the patients underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) using Castor single-branched stent-graft. In-hospital and 3-month outcomes were collected. Results: The mean operative time was 116 +/- 20.43 minutes (range 90-145). All the TEVAR procedures were successfully performed without conversion to open surgery (100% success rate). All the ARSAs of the 5 patients were revascularized in situ by Castor single-branched stent-grafts. No deaths and complications were observed in the 3-month follow-up. The maximal diameters of diseased aortas in the 4 patients with IMH decreased 3 months after TEVAR. The false lumen in the graft-covered segment was completely thrombosed in the patient with type B aortic dissection. Conclusions: Castor single-branched stent-graft may be a good choice in treatment of acute type B aortic syndrome and aberrant right subclavian artery.

J	Mukherjee, D; Kittner, J				Mukherjee, Dipankar; Kittner, Janine			Surgical Considerations in the Treatment of Axillary-Subclavian Venous Thrombosis in the Era of COVID-19	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						COVID-19; axillary; subclavian; venous thrombosis; thrombectomy; Paget-Schroetter; effort vein thrombosis; thrombolysis; thrombosis; venous occlusion		Purpose: Traditional treatment of axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis is resource intensive due to the need for advanced nursing care and increased utilization of intensive care units for thrombolysis procedures. We recently encountered this in the management of 2 patients with effort-induced upper extremity venous thrombosis following COVID-19 infection and offer a treatment paradigm for consideration. Case Reports: A 30-year-old presented with 2 weeks of left upper extremity symptoms following COVID-19 infection. Duplex ultrasound demonstrated axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis and venogram confirmed total occlusion of the axillary and subclavian veins with profuse collaterals around the occlusion. Suction thrombectomy was performed successfully and veins remained patent at 6 month follow up. The patient declined first rib resection and stopped lifting weights. A 16-year-old presented with 4 days of right arm symptoms 1 month after testing positive for COVID-19. Duplex ultrasound revealed acute axillary and subclavian vein thrombosis and she underwent successful thrombectomy followed by balloon angioplasty with improvement in symptoms. Conclusion: The pandemic has strained health care resources such that the treatment of non-life-threatening conditions must be triaged to conserve resources. While axillary-subclavian venous occlusion is usually not life-threatening, timely treatment leads to decreased morbidity and better outcomes. Percutaneous aspiration and thrombectomy without adjunctive thrombolysis may be of benefit in reducing healthcare resource utilization while still achieving good outcomes during the COVID pandemic and beyond.

May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is an anomaly where the left common iliac vein is compressed by the right common iliac artery. We present a rare case of ilio-femoral deep vein thrombosis in a patient with May-Thurner Syndrome and an underlying arteriovenous graft in-situ who presented with acute lower limb swelling. The patient underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis, pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy, venoplasty and iliac vein stenting. Follow-up surveillance duplex ultrasound showed patency of the iliac vein stent and arteriovenous graft at 1-year postoperatively.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate if patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) undergoing CT angiography (CTA) and local continuous thrombolysis for acute lower limb ischemia (ALI) had an increased risk of developing contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) compared to patients without DM. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients undergoing CTA and local continuous thrombolysis due to ALI between 2001 and 2018. CA-AKI was defined as a 25% increase in serum creatinine within 72 hours after latest contrast administration. Results: There was no difference (P = .30) in the frequency of CA-AKI between patients with (27.9%; n = 43) and without DM (20.6%; n = 170). Among patients with CA-AKI, patients with DM had a lower (P < .001) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at discharge (55 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) than at admission (70 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), while no such difference was found in the group without DM (P = .20). The gram-iodine dose/eGFR ratio was higher (P < .001) in patients with CA-AKI (median 1.49, [IQR 1.34-1.81]) than in those who did not develop CA-AKI (median 1.05 [IQR 1.00-1.13]). There was a trend that gram-iodine dose/eGFR ratio (OR 1.42/standard deviation increment, 95% CI 1.00-2.02; P = .050) was associated with an increased risk of CA-AKI, after adjusting for DM, age, and gender. Conclusions: The frequency of CA-AKI was high after CTA and local continuous thrombolysis for ALI without shown increased frequency for the DM group. Among patients with CA-AKI, however, patients with DM had worse renal function at discharge than those without DM. The gram-iodine dose/eGFR ratio in these patients needs to be lower to improve renal outcomes, particularly in patients with DM.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate computed tomography angiography based long-term patency after CFA stent placement and to analyze associated risk factors for restenosis. Methods: A retrospective and observational study was carried out in consecutive patients treated with endovascular stent placement in CFA lesions. A clinical follow-up and imaging study was performed using MD-CTA to assess different degrees of in stent restenosis (ISR) and primary, assisted, and secondary patency rates. Results: In a 5-year period, 35 extremities were treated in 33 patients with self-expandable nitinol stents. The technical success was 100% without complications related to the procedure. The mean follow-up (FU) was 32.2 months, and 8 limbs were lost. The degree of CFA stenosis was reduced from 79.69 +/- 26.47% to 11.23 +/- 24.53%. ISR < 20%, 20-70%, and >= 70% was evident in 15 (55.6%), 9 (33.3%), and 3 (11.1%) limbs, respectively. Estimated primary, assisted, and secondary patency was 79.5, 96.3, and 96.3%, respectively, after 24 months and 79.5, 96.3, and 96.3%, respectively after 60 months, with a freedom of clinical driven target lesion revascularisation rate of 87.8%. Conclusion: Endovascular treatment with self-expandable nitinol stents in CFA lesions had a high technical success rate and was related to few complications. A mild form of intimal hyperplasia was observed in a considerable number of cases. However, long-term patency was high; therefore, CFA stent placement might be a suitable therapeutic alternative in selected patients.

A Comparison of Contemporary Clinical Outcomes Following Femoro-Popliteal Plain Balloon Angioplasty and Bypass Surgery for Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						peripheral arterial disease; chronic limb threatening ischemia; angioplasty; femoro-popliteal bypass surgery	LEG BASIL TRIAL; AMPUTATION-FREE; REVASCULARIZATION; METAANALYSIS; SURVIVAL; PROTOCOL; DISEASE; RISK	Introduction: Despite the BASIL-1 trial concluding that bypass surgery (BS) was superior to plain balloon angioplasty (PBA) in terms of longer-term amputation free (AFS) and overall survival (OS), CLTI patients are increasingly offered an endovascular-first revascularization strategy. This study investigates whether the results of BASIL-1 are still relevant to current practice by comparing femoro-popliteal (FP) BS with PBA in a series of CLTI patients treated in our unit 10 years after BASIL-1 (1999-2004). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed prospectively gathered hospital data pertaining to 279 patients undergoing primary FP BS or PBA for CLTI in the period 2009 to 2014. We report baseline characteristics, 30-day morbidity and mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and long-term AFS, limb salvage (LS), OS, major adverse limb events (MALE), and freedom from re-intervention (FFR). Results: 234 (84%) and 45 (16%) patients underwent PBA and BS respectively. PBA patients were significantly older (77 vs 71 years, P = 0.001) and more likely to be female (45% vs 28%, P = 0.026). Bollinger and GLASS anatomic scores were significantly more severe in the BS group. Technical success was better for BS (100% vs 87%, P = 0.007). Index hospital stay was shorter for PBA (9.1 vs 15.6 days, P = 0.035) but there was no difference in hospital days or admissions over the next 12 months. AFS (HR 1.00), LS (HR 1.44), OS (HR 0.81), MALE (HR 1.25) and FFR (HR = 1.00) were not significantly different between PBA and BS. Conclusion: Important clinical outcomes following FP BS and PBA for CLTI have not changed significantly in our unit in the 10 years following the BASIL-1 trial. BASIL-1 therefore remains relevant to our current practice and should inform our approach to the management of CLTI going forward.

We report the technique and the results from a series of consecutive patients treated by transcatheter embolization, evaluating both ipsilateral and contralateral retrograde approaches. Methods: This was a retrospective study including patients with verified rectus muscle sheath hematoma as a result of active extravasation from the inferior epigastric artery referred for transcatheter embolization. Technical success, clinical success and major complications were calculated. In addition, minor complications, blood transfusions required after a technically successful embolization, length of stay, peri-procedural and 30-day mortality and overall survival at 6 months were obtained. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Results: Twenty-one patients (mean age = 59.67 +/- 19.51 years old) were included. The cause of the bleeding in the vast majority was iatrogenic trauma (n = 12/21, 57.14%). Both contralateral (n = 12/21, 57.14%%) and ipsilateral (n = 9/21, 42.86%) retrograde approaches were used. Embolic materials included micro-coils (n = 13/20, 65%), microspheres (PVA) (n = 1/20, 5%), a combination of PVA and micro-coils (n = 5/20, 25%) and gel-foam (n = 1/20, 5%). Overall technical success was 95.2% (n = 20/21) while clinical success was achieved in all but one of the technically successful cases 95% (n = 19/20). One patient died peri-procedurally due to profound hemodynamic shock. There were no other major complications. Additional transfusion was necessary in 7 patients (n = 7/21, 33.33%). There was a significant increase in the hemoglobin levels after the embolization (7.03 +/- 1.78 g/dL pre-procedure Vs 10.91 +/- 1.7 g/dL post-procedure, p = 0.048). The median hospital stay was 8 days. The peri-procedure and 30-day mortality was 4.8% (n = 1/21) and 28.6% (n = 6/21) respectively. The 6-month survival was 61.9% (13/21). Conclusion: Percutaneous embolization of the inferior epigastric artery is a minimally invasive method with satisfactory results. Both ipsilateral and contralateral retrograde approaches are feasible.

Material and Methods: The femoral vein diameters of 4 pigs were first measured. ICT was then applied such as to reduce the diameter of these veins by 50%. The femoral vein diameters of 2 pigs were re-measured after 1 month. The femoral vein and its surrounding tissue were excised for immunohistopathological and genetic examination. The same procedures were applied to the remaining 2 pigs 3 months subsequently. Collagen I and IV immunohistochemical staining and Masson's trichrome and Alcian blue histochemical staining were applied during immunohistopathological examination. Collagen I, III, and IV and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) mRNA expressions were examined for genetic examination. Results: The femoral vein diameters decreased by approximately 50% after ICT application. This decrease persisted after the first and third months. Histopathological examination revealed loose connective tissue around the venous tissue after the operation, particularly in the third month, together with perivascular fibrosis and increased collagen in connective tissue. No difference was observed between regions with and without ICT application in terms of mucinous degeneration, an indicator of tissue injury, during Alcian blue staining. Genetic examination revealed an increase in collagen I and IV and CTGF mRNA expression in perivascular tissue resulting from ICT application. Conclusion: ICT is effective both in terms of creating a durable tissue around the vein and of increasing collagen tissue and stimulating fibrosis, and has no deleterious side-effects on tissue.

Following deployment of the stent graft, the superior mesenteric artery was shuttered, and the patient subsequently developed signs and symptoms of bowel ischemia. The patient underwent successful retrograde open superior mesenteric artery stenting with resolution of her symptoms. Although retrograde open mesenteric artery stenting (ROMS) has been primarily shown to be effective in acute mesenteric ischemia, this case demonstrates that ROMS can be used as a salvage option for shuttering during endovascular procedures.

One percent of patients with CoA have concomitant an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA). Purpose: We report the case of a 35-year-old woman with uncontrolled hypertension who was found to have CoA and ARSA. Results: The patient was treated successfully using a hybrid procedure comprising ARSA ligation and subclavian to carotid transposition, followed by thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Conclusions: Patients with CoA should be carefully studied, considering the possible coexistence of other congenital aortic arch defects, such as ARSA. Hybrid repair is a safe and effective approach for this condition.

Materials and Methods: In a 2 years period, 14 no-option cCLI patients were treated with percutaneous deep vein arterialization (pDVA) by creating an AVF with a IVUS-guided system between posterior tibial artery and its satellite deep vein. Technical success was defined as successful AVF creation and venous perfusion of the wound site. Patients' characteristics, procedure details, mortality and wound outcomes were assessed prospectively. Results: Successful pDVA was successfully performed in all patients (mean age 82 years) without any procedural complications. Clinical improvement was achieved in all patients with resolution of rest pain, tissue formation of granulation tissue or both; only 3 major amputations were performed within the study period with a limb salvage rate of 78%. Median wound healing time was 4.8 months. Conclusion: pDVA is a safe and feasible revascularization technique alternative in no-option cCLI patients.

The Benefits of a Muscle-Sparing Below Knee Amputation in the Elderly Population	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						muscle-sparing below knee amputation; below knee amputation; elderly; anterior tibialis muscle; stump coverage; stump failure	ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; LIMB AMPUTATION; WALKING; RISK	Background It is well accepted that good muscle coverage of the bones at the end of a below knee amputation (BKA) stump is preferable, for both weight bearing and protection against prosthesis failure. Elderly patients often have atrophy of the leg musculature secondary to age-related physiological changes and decreased use. These patients often have poor coverage and bulk in their stumps after the standard BKA. We propose a selective muscle-sparing approach to these patients, utilizing selective removal of muscle bundles with regard to their blood supply and fascial planes. The surgical method technique along with outcomes of patients undergoing the procedure is presented here. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed to identify patients who had undergone a muscle-sparing BKA from March 2008 to October 2017 by a single surgeon. Estimated blood loss, operative time, and perioperative and postoperative complications were assessed. Results Forty-six patients greater than 60 years of age underwent muscle-sparing BKA procedures. Complete healing was seen in 30 (65%) patients, while 7 (15%) were lost to follow-up and 9 (20%) required conversion to an above knee amputation (AKA). Intraoperative outcomes in our series were notable for an average estimated blood loss (EBL) of 84.3 ml, lower than the traditional BKA (average EBL 150-500 ml), with comparable operative times averaging 131 minutes and as short as 85 minutes (skin incision to dressing). No patients in the cohort required postoperative blood transfusions (day 0-4), significantly less than the reported 3-7 ml/kg body weight blood requirements in similar patient populations. Conclusions The muscle-sparing BKA technique should be considered in elderly patients, where the normally bulky posterior calf muscle mass is lacking. The selective removal of muscle bundles with regard to their blood supply leaves maximum coverage of the bone with decreased potential hematoma formation and blood loss.

RVAs can be secondary to thrombosis, venous hypertension, or renal arteriovenous fistula (RAVF). RVAs secondary to RAVF are rare. Patients with RVA may present with hypertension, abdominal pain, hematuria, or may even be asymptomatic. However, there may be life-threatening emergencies including aneurysm rupture, thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. The treatment of RVAs includes reconstruction of the renal vein, nephrectomy, and endovascular treatment. Purpose: In this technical note, we report the endovascular treatment of a giant RVA that developed secondary to an acquired RAVF by the placement of multiple vascular plugs. Conclusion: Endovascular occlusion of the RAVF with vascular plugs is effective to prevent a life-threatening rupture of RVA. Clinical follow-up is crucial to detect leakage or migration of the vascular plugs.

The factors that affect catheter restoration and also catheter survival following thrombolytic therapy are not well described. In this study, we aimed to reveal the predictors that affect the success of the procedure and also present post-restoration catheter patency after intraluminal thrombolytic administration. Method: This retrospective study included 62 patients with tunneled THC thrombosis treated with alteplase between 2017 and2020 in the study center. Age, comorbidities, the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulants, a history of catheter thrombosis, time on dialysis, the duration of the catheter were investigated as possible predictors of procedural success. The independent predictive factors for procedural success were evaluated by using backward stepwise likelihood ratio logistic regression analysis. Primaryand assisted patencieswere presented with Kaplan-Meier graphs. Results: Thrombolityc was administered to 62 patients 102 times. The median primary patency from the first thrombolytic administration to a second catheter thrombosis was 9 months (range 1-20 months). The overall median patency was 12 months (range 2-23 months). The overall procedural success rate was 79.4% (81/102).Multivariate analyses revealed that a history of prior catheter thrombosis was the only risk factor for procedural success (OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.26-0.91; p = 0.004). The need for a second dwell time among patients with prior history of thrombolysis was significantly higher compared to patients without a history of catheter thrombosis (12/26 patients, 46.2% and 6/55 patients, 10.9%; respectively; p = 0.001). Conclusion: The success of thrombolysis in subsequent de novo THC thrombosis decreases in patients who previously required intraluminal thrombolytic administration. Identifying patient subgroups with a high risk for THC thrombosis may be useful to investigate effective secondary prevention strategies.

Methods: In the retrospective cross-sectional study, the CTA scans of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms and thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms type II-IV were assessed. Patients with thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms type I and V and history of abdominal aortic surgery were excluded from the study. Results: Study group comprised 937 patients with a median age of 73.0 years, 83.8% of whom were male. CTA revealed renal tumors in 11 patients (1.2% of the study population) with a median size of 26 mm (interquartile range 20-50). Adrenal incidentalomas were found in 61 patients (6.5% of the study population). In 20 patients (2.1%) adrenal lesions were found bilaterally. Conclusion: In the described cohort, the renal and adrenal tumors were relatively common findings among patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm and thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms type II-IV. Both anaesthesiologists and surgeons should be vigilant about the possibility of such coexistence in order to provide the patients with the best possible perioperative care and an optimal surgical modality.

However, IVC filter removal is complicated when the filter has penetrated the IVC wall and endovascular techniques usually fail. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of retroperitoneal laparoscopic-assisted retrieval of wall-penetrating IVC filters after endovascular techniques have failed. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated a series of 8 patients who underwent retroperitoneal laparoscopic-assisted retrieval of a wall-penetrating IVC filter between December 2017 and November 2019. All patients had experienced at least 1 failure with endovascular retrieval before the study. The filters were slanted and the proximal retrieval hooks penetrated the posterior lateral IVC wall in all patients on computed tomography. Demographic information, operation parameters, and complications were recorded and analyzed. All patients were followed up for at least 12 months. Results: The procedure was successful in all patients. The median surgery time was 53.6 +/- 12.7 min and the average blood loss was 45.0 +/- 13.5 ml. No serious complication occurred during the patients' hospitalization, which was an average of 6.4 days. The median follow-up time was 15.1 months, and no patient had deep vein thrombosis recurrence. Conclusions: Retroperitoneal laparoscopic-assisted retrieval is a feasible and effective technique, particularly when proximal retrieval hooks penetrate the posterior lateral wall of the IVC after endovascular techniques have failed. To some extent, the development of this technique at our institution has increased the success rate of filter removal and improved patient satisfaction.

We conducted a study prospectively to compare time resolved magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with diagnostic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for the vascular assessment in the patients of NSAA. Materials and Methods: Seventeen patients of NSAA were recruited in the study over the period of 3 years. Contrast enhanced MRA using Time-resolved angiography With Interleaved Stochastic Trajectories (TWIST) sequence and diagnostic DSA were performed in these 17 patients. Results: The majority of the patients were young (median age was 25 years, range 8 to 46 years) and 11 patients were females. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 9 patients and C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in 6 patients. Most commonly involved vessels in our patients were right renal artery (14 patients), abdominal aorta (12 patients) and left renal artery (11 patients). Left and right subclavian arteres were involved in 10 and 6 patients respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of time-resolved MRA using TWIST sequence is 100% as compared to DSA in the assessment of major vessels such as aorta, arch vessels, celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery. However, the sensitivity and specificity of time resolved MRA in the evaluation of renal arteries and vertebral arteries were 100%, 71.4% and 85.7%, 33.3% respectively. No significant association of MRI contrast enhancement with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 1.00) and C-reactive protein (p = 0.600). Conclusion: Time resolved MRA images obtained using TWIST sequence were as qualitative as DSA images and can noninvasively evaluate the vascular involvement in NSAA patients.

Hybrid technique (HT), an emerging treatment modality for complex aortic pathologies, decreases morbidity and mortality relative to open surgery. However, outcome data regarding HT in genetic aortopathies such as MFS is limited. We describe a case of a young male with hypertension and type B aortic dissection (AD) complicated by a symptomatic thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA). He underwent staged HT comprised of carotid-carotid transposition followed by zone 1 thoracic endovascular aortic repair and concurrent retrograde left subclavian stent graft placement. Genetic analysis was consistent with Marfan syndrome. Subsequent growth of his TAAA warranted open extent type IV TAAA repair with individual renovisceral and iliac bypasses. The patient recovered from the second surgery without further progression of disease or late complication.

Endovascular treatment is increasingly used for symptomatic relief, but clinical success depends on accurate patient evaluation and selection. This case describes the diagnostic and technical challenges in the care of a complex patient with post-thrombotic syndrome following stroke and extensive deep vein thrombosis. It highlights the multi-disciplinary work-up for a patient with post-thrombotic syndrome presenting with confounding symptoms, as well as the importance of considering alternative access for successful lower extremity venous recanalization.

Several surgical treatments are available; however, the optimal treatment strategy and long-term outcomes remain unelucidated. We herein report the 5-year outcomes of six patients treated with extra-anatomical bypass surgery for middle aortic syndrome. Case presentations Between 2013 and 2016, six patients underwent extra-anatomical bypass for middle aortic syndrome at our institute: three had Takayasu's arteritis, one had vessel vasculitis, and two had middle aortic hypoplastic syndrome of unknown origin. The patients included five women and one man, with a mean age of 59.7 years. Four patients had uncontrolled hypertension and were receiving antihypertensive medications. The mean ankle-brachial pressure index was .61. The three patients with Takayasu's arteritis were hospitalized for congestive heart failure. These patients underwent bypass surgery from the descending aorta to the infrarenal abdominal aorta, and one also underwent concomitant heart surgery. The patient with microscopic polyangiitis underwent Y-grafting with an aortic aneurysmectomy. Subsequently, bypass surgery was performed from the descending aorta to the graft via the diaphragm. The two patients with unknown causes underwent bypass surgery from the proximal descending aorta to the distal descending thoracic aorta. There were no early or late deaths at the 5-year follow-up. We did not observe any changes in anastomotic site stenosis or new aneurysmal changes during the follow-up period. The number of antihypertensive medications was reduced in all cases, and critical symptoms, including headache, severe abdominal pain, claudication, and heart failure, improved in all patients. The ankle-brachial pressure index increased to 1.11 and did not change for five years. Renal function remained stable, and the brain natriuretic peptide level decreased from 302.8 to 74.5 pg/mL at follow-up. Conclusion Extra-anatomical bypass for middle aortic syndrome is safe and effective, and can help prevent renal failure, and relieve critical ischemic symptoms.

However, a risk of recanalization of the embolized vessels has been reported. To augment the effectiveness of embolization, the coil-in-plug (CIP) technique was developed, exclusively using AVP I or IV. However, these plugs cannot be used for large vessels like portovenous shunt because of the size limitation. AVP II has a larger-sized model up to 22 mm. This article reports two cases of embolizing high-flow and large-caliber portosystemic shunts where the CIP technique with multilayer AVP II was effectively employed. Materials and methods The CIP technique using AVP II was utilized for one case with a portocaval shunt and another with a splenorenal shunt. CIP was established with wire penetration through the multilayer meshes, followed by a microcatheter insertion. After the microcatheter was positioned in the central lobe, the internal space was embolized tightly using pushable or detachable coils. Results A use of guidewire with a high tip load enabled an establishment of CIP and complete occlusion of the target vessels immediately without migration of the embolic devices in both cases. The symptom of encephalopathy improved after the procedure in both the case of the portocaval and the splenorenal shunt. Conclusion The CIP technique with the AVP II was safe and effective to achieve complete occlusion of the large-caliber portosystemic shunts.

J	Ulloa, JH; Figueroa, V; Cifuentes, JS; Pinto, P; Lurie, F				Ulloa, Jorge H.; Figueroa, Valentin; Cifuentes, Juan Sebastian; Pinto, Paula; Lurie, Fedor			The Impact of COVID-19 on Vascular Surgery Practice: A Systematic Review	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Review						COVID-19; deep venous thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; microangiopathy; peripheral arterial disease	PULMONARY-EMBOLISM; MANIFESTATIONS; COAGULOPATHY; THROMBOSIS; ISCHEMIA; VEIN	Background: COVID-19 is characterized by a pulmonary interstitial compromise which can require intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation. Covid patients develop a wide range of pathologies. This study aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 in diseases commonly treated by vascular surgeons. Methods: Four conditions were selected: venous thromboembolism (VTE), pulmonary embolism (PE), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and microangiopathy. A systematic review of the literature using PRISMA guidelines was. Results: Out of 1195 papers reviewed for conditions in COVID-19 patients relevant to routine vascular surgery practice, 43 papers were included and analyzed. Venous thrombosis was found to be the most common COVID-19 associated pathology with a cumulative incidence of 25% at 7 days and 48% at 14 days. Additionally, D-dimer levels proved to be a good predictor, even in the early stages of the disease with a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 88.5% and a negative predictive value of 94.7%. Patients in the ICU demonstrated a significantly higher risk of developing VTE, even when receiving pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Although evidence of arterial thrombosis was less common (1% to 16.3%), its consequences were typically more serious, including limb loss and death even in young individuals (OR = 25, 95% CI). Finally, microangiopathy has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations from retinal microangiopathy to other more severe manifestations such as myocardial injury, pulmonary compromise and potential multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Conclusions: Although the pathophysiological pathway by which COVID-19 produces thrombosis is not completely clear, the incidence of both arterial and venous thrombosis is increased. D-dimer screening should be done in all COVID-19 patients, as a predictor of thrombotic complications.

The objective of this study is to characterize the factors associated with increased total costs after peripheral bypass surgery. Methods: Data for 34,819 patients undergoing peripheral bypass surgery in NY State were extracted using the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) database for years 2009-2017. Patient demographics, All Patient Refined Diagnostic Related Groups (APR) severity score, mortality risk, hospital volume, and length of stay data were collected. Primary outcomes were total costs and length of stay. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: 28.1% of peripheral bypass surgeries were performed in New York City. 7.9% of patients had extreme APR severity of illness whereas 32.0% had major APR severity of illness. 6.3% of patients had extreme risk of mortality and 1 in every 5 patients (20%) had major risk of mortality. 24.9% of patients were discharged to a facility. The mean length of stay (LOS) was 9.9 days. Patient LOS of 6-11 days was associated with +$2,791.76 total costs. Mean LOS of >= 12 days was associated with + $27,194.88 total costs. Multivariate analysis revealed risk factors associated with an admission listed in the fourth quartile of total costs (>=$36,694.44) for peripheral bypass surgery included NYC location (2.82, CI 2.62-3.04), emergency surgery (1.12, CI 1.03-1.22), extreme APR 2.08, 1.78-2.43, extreme risk of mortality (2.73, 2.34-3.19), emergency room visit (1.68, 1.57-1.81), discharge to a facility (1.27, CI 1.15-1.41), and LOS in the third or fourth quartile (11.09, 9.87-12.46). Conclusion: The cost of peripheral bypass surgery in New York State is influenced by a variety of factors including LOS, patient comorbidity and disease severity, an ER admission, and discharge to a facility.

Methods: Forty-six ICA ISRs, which were reintervened at least once, were retrospectively analyzed regarding clinical and imaging characteristics, as well as invasive treatment type (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [PTA] with a plain balloon, PTA with a drug-eluting balloon [DEB], re-stenting) used. Results: The median follow-up was 29.5 months (IQR, 8.5-52.8 months) in patients who underwent reintervention for ICA ISR. Stent occlusion occurred in 3 patients (6.5%). One ISR recurrence was noted in 10 patients (21.7%); reintervention was carried out in 7 cases (7/10 [70%]; PTA, N = 5; PTA with a DEB, N = 1; re-stenting, N = 1), while 3 patients (3/10; 30%) received best medical treatment. Two ISR recurrences were observed in 3 patients (6.5%); all of them underwent reintervention (PTA, N = 1; PTA with a DEB, N = 2). Three ISR recurrences were seen in 1 patient (2.2%), who was treated with PTA. No recurrence was observed in those patients, who had DEB treatment. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed statin therapy to be a protective factor against recurrent ISR (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.84; P = .029). Conclusion: Our study suggests that PTA with a DEB is the most effective for the treatment of recurrent ISR, and confirms the importance of statin use in patients who have had a carotid reintervention.

J	Parker, MH; Colpitts, DK; Gilson, GF; Ryan, L; Mukherjee, D				Parker, Michael H.; Colpitts, Dayle K.; Gilson, Genevieve F.; Ryan, Liam; Mukherjee, Dipankar			Carotid-Axillary Bypass as an Alternative to Carotid-Subclavian Bypass Following Coverage of Left Subclavian Artery During TEVAR	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						TEVAR; carotid-subclavian; carotid-axillary; bypass; phrenic nerve		Introduction: Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR) has become the procedure of choice for pathology involving the descending thoracic aorta since its approval by the FDA in 2005. Left subclavian artery (LSA) coverage is commonly required to facilitate an adequate proximal landing zone for the endograft. The traditional revascularization procedure of choice is carotid-subclavian bypass, however recent studies report complication rates as high as 29%-specifically phrenic nerve palsy in 25% of patients undergoing this procedure. Our aim is to present our experience using carotid-axillary bypass as a safe alternative to carotid-subclavian bypass. Methods: All patients undergoing carotid-axillary bypass for TEVAR with LSA coverage between June 2016 and September 2019 at a tertiary medical center were retrospectively identified. Short-term and long-term complications were identified and analyzed including: phrenic nerve, recurrent laryngeal nerve, and axillary nerve injuries, as well as local vascular complications requiring re-intervention. All perioperative chest radiographs were reviewed for new hemidiaphragm elevation to assess for phrenic nerve injuries. Results: 35 patients underwent carotid-axillary bypass in conjunction with TEVAR during this time period. The majority of bypasses were performed concurrently with TEVAR (80.0%, 28/35) utilizing GORE PROPATEN 8 mm externally supported vascular graft (91.4%, 32/35). The complication rate specific to carotid-axillary bypass was 14.3% (5/35). We observed a significantly lower (0%, 0/35, P < 0.01) rate of phrenic nerve palsy for carotid-axillary bypass compared to the previously reported 25% (27/107) for carotid-subclavian bypass. For patients with available follow-up imaging (85.7%, 30/35), there was a 100% patency rate at time intervals ranging from 0-1066 days (IQR = 3-37.8). Conclusion: Carotid-axillary bypass can be performed as a safe alternative to carotid-subclavian bypass for LSA coverage during TEVAR involving a more superficial anatomic course of dissection. Phrenic nerve palsy, a well-described complication of the traditional carotid-subclavian bypass, was not observed in this retrospective series.

Computed tomography (CT) has been shown to be a useful complement to optimize treatment planning and can easily be performed after conventional LAG. The treatment options for lymphatic leaks include conservative dietary modification, sclerotherapy, embolization, and surgery. We present a case of a 48-year-old man who developed a symptomatic left retroperitoneal lymphatic fluid collection after left nephrectomy, complicated by postoperative retroperitoneal abscess. Retroperitoneal duct leak was confirmed via ultrasound-guided intranodal LAG and post-LAG CT. This leak was successfully managed with N-butyl cyanoacrylate glue embolization of the leaking lymphatics via fluoroscopic-guided catheterization of the leak via percutaneous access through the lymphatic fluid collection.

Case 1. A 70-year-old gentleman found with an uncomplicated ABAD with false lumen occluded, developed SCI shortly after admission during the initial medical management. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage (CSFD) was initiated followed by emergent TEVAR. SCI improved, and the patient was discharged. Case 2. A 52-year-old gentleman developed uncomplicated ABAD with patent false lumen. 5 hours after admission, he developed SCI during the initial medical management. Emergent TEVAR was performed followed by CSFD, and the SCI improved before discharge. These cases prompted us to address prompt TEVAR for primary entry closure and true lumen dilatation with postoperative hypertensive management to relieve the dynamic obstruction of the segmental arteries responsible for the compromised spinal cord circulation in complicated ABAD.

While the bulk of arterial supply to the tumour is derived from the external carotid system, some degree of contribution from the internal carotid artery (ICA) is common. ICA branch embolisation in this setting has previously been avoided due to concerns over ischaemic neurological complications, possibly contributing to the increased intraoperative blood loss observed in patients with tumours with ICA supply. There is a marked paucity of reports of embolisation of ICA branches supplying JNA in the medical literature. We present a case of successful embolisation of an aberrant pharyngeal branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery arising from the proximal cervical ICA, which was making a significant contribution to tumour blood supply in a male adolescent with a very large JNA.

Aortic valve perforation is one of those rare and major adverse events. In this report, we describe a case of an 82-year-old woman who suffered aortic valve perforation during EVAR caused by the wire-push technique. Her hemodynamics became unstable during the procedure and did not improve thereafter. Echocardiography performed 8 days after EVAR revealed aortic valve perforation. Surgical intervention was abandoned because her general condition was poor. The patient died 4 months after EVAR due to heart failure. It should be reminded that inadvertent manipulation of the wire can cause aortic valve perforation even during EVAR.

Research Design/ Study sample: This is a case report of a ruptured left gastric artery aneurysm as the first presentation of fibromuscular dysplasia. Data collection: After written consent from the patient, relevant clinical notes and imaging were retrospectively reviewed and critically analysed. Purpose: This case reiterates the importance of considering fibromuscular dysplasia as an uncommon cause of visceral artery aneurysms. In addition, this case shows that the impact of visceral artery vasospasm on endovascular access should not be underestimated and subsequent attempts can be successful after a period of resuscitation. Results: After initial difficulty in endovascular treatment due to visceral vasospasm, the case was successfully managed with with staged open ligation and endovascular embolization after a period of resuscitation. Conclusions: FMD is an important differential diagnosis to consider in cases of visceral aneurysms.	[Ho, Kelvin K.

A 65-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), treated with tissue plasminogen activator and oral anticoagulation, was admitted to hospital for dyspnea. Enhanced computed tomography showed recurrent PE and right SFVA with a mural thrombus. The SFVA was not identified during the first PE. The PE was not massive and was treated with direct oral anticoagulants. The thrombus in the SFVA caused the PE, and surgical repair was performed to prevent further embolic events. Under general anesthesia, the SFVA was excised, and direct anastomosis was performed. PE recurrence, venous aneurysmal changes, and thrombosis were not noted at the 1-year follow-up.

Novel solutions for EVAR salvage may be required in patients unable to tolerate explant or travel to centers with custom-fenestrated capabilities. However, strategies utilizing commercially available devices are often limited by anatomic constraints such as short renal artery to endograft bifurcation length. We present a case of progressive sac expansion due to late, concomitant type Ia and type IIIa endoleaks. The patient was successfully treated by proximal extension into the visceral segment using a Cook Zenith Fenestrated device and graft relining using the Endologix AFX(R)2.

Endovascular intervention has been advocated as first line of treatment for CBS. This Case Report describes 5 patients with prior history of head and neck cancer who presented with CBS. Two patients presented as acute, 2 as impending, and one as threatened CBS. The lesions found were pseudoaneurysm and focal vascular irregularities involving the common carotid artery, cervical internal carotid artery and lingual artery. Embolization and occlusion with detachable coils of the artery was used in all patients. Technical success and immediate hemostasis were achieved in all patients. One patient presented transient cranial nerve palsy. No recurrent CBS was reported during the follow-up. In our experience, coil embolization, if possible, is a safe and efficient technique in treatment of CBS secondary to head and neck cancers.

Materials and Methods: A 110 patients with an infrarenal AAA were prospectively enrolled in this study. Fifty-six patients received an EVAR, whereas 54 patients received an open surgical repair. Moreover, 103 gender and age-matched subjects without AAA served as controls. The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) was applied for measurement of the arterial stiffness. Results: CAVI values were statistically higher in the AAA patients when compared with control subjects. Although at 48 hours postoperatively the CAVI values were increased in both groups when compared to baseline values, the difference in CAVI had a tendency to be higher in the open group compared to the endovascular group. At 6 months of follow up the CAVI values returned to the baseline for the patients of the open repair group. However, in the endovascular group CAVI values remained higher when compared with the baseline values. Conclusion: Patients with AAAs demonstrated a higher value of CAVI compared to healthy controls. A significant increase of arterial stiffness in both groups during the immediate postoperative period was documented. The increase in arterial stiffness remained significant at 6 months in EVAR patients. Further studies are needed to elucidate the impact of a decreased aortic compliance after stentgraft implantation on the cardiac function of patients with AAA.

J	Hao, YJ; Han, WT; Mou, DT; Wang, JT				Hao, Yujun; Han, Weitao; Mou, Detang; Wang, Jintao			Efficacy and Safety of Rivaroxaban Therapy for Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Review						rivaroxaban; peripheral artery disease; meta-analysis	DOUBLE-BLIND; ASPIRIN; WARFARIN; RISK	Objective: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in patients with PAD for the first time. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library database for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted for PAD. Results: Three trials which contained 14873 patients were included for final meta-analysis. The results showed patients with rivaroxaban was associated with reduction in primary efficacy outcome (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.90; p < 0.001). The RR was 0.85 (0.71 to 1.01) for patients with rivaroxaban alone and 0.81 (0.74 to 0.89) for those with rivaroxaban plus aspirin (p for heterogeneity between groups = 0.65). Patients with rivaroxaban showed a lower rate of acute limb ischemia (0.56; 0.47 to 0.66; p < 0.001). There was a trend toward a reduction in the rate of major amputation for vascular causes in the rivaroxaban arm (0.81; 0.63 to 1.03; p = 0.08). Compared with control, rivaroxaban therapy did not reduce the risks of myocardial infarction (0.87, 0.73 to 1.04, p = 0.12), ischemic stroke (0.85, CI 0.68 to 1.06, p = 0.15), death from cardiovascular causes (0.99, 0.85 to 1.15, p = 0.91) or death from any cause (1.00, 0.90 to 1.12, p = 0.98). Rivaroxaban therapy was associated with a 1.57-fold higher major bleeding rate as compared with those with aspirin or warfarin alone. Conclusions: Overall, the risks of the primary efficacy outcomes or adverse limb events were significantly lower with rivaroxaban than with aspirin or warfarin alone in patients with PAD. It also points out the significant major bleeding that occur because of such therapies.

J.; Yang, Gary K.; Baxter, Keith; Gagnon, Joel			Evaluation of Aortic Zone 2 Proximal Landing Accuracy During Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair Following Carotid-Subclavian Revascularization	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						TEVAR; endoleak; thoracic aortic aneurysm; endograft; aortic arch		Background: Adequate seal for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) commonly requires landing in zone 2, but can prove to be challenging due to the tortuous and angulated anatomy of the region. Objectives: Our objective was to determine the proximal landing accuracy of zone 2-targeted TEVARs following carotid-subclavian revascularization (CSR) and its impact on clinical outcomes. Methods: Retrospective review of patients that underwent CSR for zone 2 endograft delivery at a tertiary institute between January 2008 and March 2018 was conducted. Technical outcomes were assessed by examining the incidence of intraoperative corrective maneuvers, 1a endoleaks and reinterventions. Distance to target and incidence of LSA stump filling were examined as radiographic markers of landing accuracy. Results: Zone 2-targeted TEVAR with CSR was performed in 53 patients for treatment of dissections (49%), aneurysms (30%) or trauma (21%). Nine (17%) cases required intraoperative corrective procedures: 5 (9%) proximal cuffs due to type 1a endoleak and 4 (8%) left common carotid artery (LCCA) stenting due to inadvertent coverage. Cases performed using higher resolution hybrid fluoroscopy machine compared to mobile C-arm were associated with increased proximal cuff use (OR 8.8; 95% CI 1.2-62.4). Average distance between the proximal edge of the covered graft to LCCA was 8 +/- 1 mm and larger distances were not associated with higher rates of 1a endoleak. Twenty-eight (53%) cases of antegrade LSA stump filling were noted on follow-up imaging, but were not associated with higher rates of reinterventions (OR 0.8, 95% CI [0.2-4.6]). Three (6%) patients had a stroke within 30 days and 4 (8%) patients expired within 1 month. Intraoperative corrective maneuvers, post-operative 1a endoleak and reinterventions were not associated with higher rates of stroke or mortality. Conclusion: Using current endografts and imaging modalities, zone 2-targeted TEVARs have suboptimal technical accuracy.	[Choi, Sally H.

The aim of the present study was to analyze and categorize the causes of perioperative strokes after CEA. Methods: All CEAs performed from 2006 to 2019 in a single center were collected. CEA was routinely performed under general anesthesia, with routine shunting and patching, using cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring. Carotid exposure technique was classified as either clamped-dissection (CD) or preclamping-dissection (PCD) if the carotid bifurcation was dissected after or prior to carotid clamping. Perioperative and 30-day strokes and their possible mechanisms were evaluated according to preoperative symptoms and surgical technique adopted. Results: Among 1760 CEAs performed, 30 (1.7%) perioperative strokes occurred. 14 (47%) were identified upon emergence from general anesthesia, and 16 (53%) were noted in the first 30 days following intervention. Stroke etiology was categorized as follows: technical (acute thrombosis or intimal flap or due to intraoperative complications), embolic (no recognized technical defect), hemorrhagic, or contralateral. Symptomatic patients had a significantly higher rate of any type of stroke than asymptomatic patients (3.8% vs 0.9%, P = .0001). CD was protective for postoperative stroke (0.9% vs 3.1%, P = .001) in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (2.5% vs 5.9%, P = .05; 0.4% vs 1.9%, P = .005), particularly for the cohort in which symptomatic patients (0.7% vs 3.2%, P = .04) suffered postoperative embolic stroke. Conclusion: Perioperative stroke in CEA may be multifactorial in etiology, including a result of technical errors. A CD technique may help reduce the incidence of perioperative stroke.

The diagnosis of a syphilitic popliteal aneurysm was made due to positive syphilitic serological testing and with exclusion of all other potential causes. The pseudoaneurysm was surgically repaired using a great saphenous vein patch angioplasty, which was done without delay to prevent further thromboembolic complications. This was then followed by a course of intravenous benzyl penicillin. Discussion: Peripheral arterial involvement of tertiary syphilis remains exceedingly rare, with the vast majority of reported cases of vascular syphilis relating to aortic involvement. Given the paucity of literature on this condition, there is no good evidence to guide current management. Conclusion: With the globally increasing rates of syphilis, more cases of peripheral arterial involvement may become apparent, as was the case in the early 20th century.

The patient underwent a two-stage repair for both pathologies. After an aortic valve replacement, postcardiotomy pericardial effusion occurred and was medically managed. Six months later, the patient underwent a distal arcus aorta and subclavian artery replacement with a left posterolateral thoracotomy as the second stage. Due to the strict adhesions, pulmonary veins were not cannulated and an extracorporeal bypass between the pulmonary artery and femoral artery was used for distal body perfusion. The coincidence of subclavian aneurysms and a pseudocoarctation of the aorta is rare and a literature review was performed to identify treatment options for this pathology.

Although there is no standard treatment, most cases can be managed conservatively; intervention is reserved for symptomatic or enlarging aneurysms. For patients who are not surgical candidates due to cirrhosis and portal hypertension, endovascular creation of a trans-jugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt (TIPS) is an option to reduce portal venous pressure. This report describes a case of an enlarging PVA successfully treated with TIPS in a patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis.

May-Thurner syndrome is also a rare pathology involving compression of the left common iliac vein, usually by the right common iliac artery. The incidence of concomitant occurrence of these entities is unknown and not well reported. This case series describes 3 patients who underwent evaluation of symptomatic left lower extremity venous disease. All 3 suffered symptomatic Klippel-Trenaunay initially, and were subsequently diagnosed with concomitant May-Thurner Syndrome. They were successfully treated with left common iliac vein stents with symptomatic improvement.

Postoperative surveillance included DU at 1 month and CTA at 3 months. 82 patients met inclusion criteria including 39 (47.6%) ChEVAR and 43 (52.4%) FEVAR cases. DU identified endoleak with aneurysm sac enlargement in 3 cases requiring reintervention. CTA at 3 months detected 2 new endoleaks without growth and 1 renal artery stent occlusion. Replacement of initial postoperative imaging with DU did not result in any missed endoleaks, deaths, ruptures, or branch occlusions.	[George, Justin; Tadros, Rami O.; Rao, Ajit; Png, C. Y.

Endovascular approaches, rather than traditional open procedures, are increasingly used to treat a wide range of vascular disease. The use of endovascular repair for revascularization in the trauma setting is not routine but may provide an appealing alternative in select trauma patients and injuries. We present a case of successful endovascular repair with stent grafting of a superficial femoral artery intimal injury following a femur fracture in a 35-year-old morbidly obese female and review the current literature regarding the use of endovascular therapy in the trauma setting.

Deep Learning and Multivariable Models Select EVAR Patients for Short-Stay Discharge	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						aneurysm; health services research; EVAR; care pathways	AORTIC-ANEURYSM REPAIR; RISK; FEASIBILITY; MORTALITY; OUTCOMES; SAFETY; IMAGES; TRENDS	Objectives: We sought to develop a prediction score with data from the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) EVAR in efforts to assist endovascular specialists in deciding whether or not a patient is appropriate for short-stay discharge. Background: Small series describe short-stay discharge following elective EVAR. Our study aims to quantify characteristics associated with this decision. Methods: The VQI EVAR and NSQIP datasets were queried. Patients who underwent elective EVAR recorded in VQI, between 1/2010-5/2017 were split 2:1 into test and analytic cohorts via random number assignment. Cross-reference with the Medicare claims database confirmed all-cause mortality data. Bootstrap sampling was employed in model. Deep learning algorithms independently evaluated each dataset as a sensitivity test. Results: Univariate outcomes, including 30-day survival, were statistically worse in the DD group when compared to the SD group (all P < 0.05). A prediction score, SD-EVAR, derived from the VQI EVAR dataset including pre- and intra-op variables that discriminate between SD and DD was externally validated in NSQIP (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.79, P < 0.001); deep learning analysis concurred. This score suggests 66% of EVAR patients may be appropriate for short-stay discharge. A free smart phone app calculating short-stay discharge potential is available through QxMD Calculate https://qxcalc.app.link/vqidis. Conclusions: Selecting patients for short-stay discharge after EVAR is possible without increasing harm. The majority of infrarenal AAA patients treated with EVAR in the United States fit a risk profile consistent with short-stay discharge, representing a significant cost-savings potential to the healthcare system.

A rupture of ICA is a possible mechanism of intramural aortic hematoma (IH). We report a case with IH and ICAs without clear etiology. Case presentation: A 64-year-old man was admitted to our emergency room with a sudden onset of acute diffused abdominal and chest pain, radiating to the back. Without previous traumatic insult, a computed tomographic angiography scan (CTA) revealed an IH beginning inferior to the left subclavian artery extending to the level of the celiac trunk. Follow-up CTA demonstrated a stable maximal IH thickness diameter of 11 mm, maximal aortic diameter of 40 mm, a new left hemorrhagic pleural effusion, and a focal contrast enhancement at T9 level. Due to these findings, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was performed. During follow up, T9 focal enhancement continues to grow and an additional one developed. Selective angiography was performed demonstrating a connection to the costal artery and the aortic lumen, confirming ICA. Successful embolization with micro coils was performed. During follow up, additional 2 ICAs developed and treated with embolization. CTA three months later showed a complete resolution of the IH and obliteration of all treated ICAs. Infectious, inflammatory and connective tissue disease investigations were undertaken without a clear etiology. Conclusions: This is a case of IH and ICAs, in the absence of a clear etiology which were successfully treated by endovascular procedures TEVAR and coil embolization. It is not clear whether the hematoma was the source of the ICA or the other way round. Lack of ICAs in the initial CTA might be due to the pressure exerted by the hematoma or that they were too small to be detected but continued to grow on follow up. Rupture of these micro-aneurysms is a possible mechanism of intramural aortic hematoma.

Statius			Wall Shear Stress Assessment of the False Lumen in Acute Type B Aortic Dissection Visualized by 4-Dimensional Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging: An Ex-Vivo Study	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						aortic dissection; type B; four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging; ex-vivo	THORACIC AORTA; TEAR SIZE; MANAGEMENT; QUANTIFICATION; PRESSURE; PORCINE; MOTION; MODEL	Background: Four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D flow MRI) can accurately visualize and quantify flow and provide hemodynamic information such as wall shear stress (WSS). This imaging technique can be used to obtain more insight in the hemodynamic changes during cardiac cycle in the true and false lumen of uncomplicated acute Type B Aortic Dissection (TBAD). Gaining more insight of these forces in the false lumen in uncomplicated TBAD during optimal medical treatment, might result in prediction of adverse outcomes. Methods: A porcine aorta dissection model with an artificial dissection was positioned in a validated ex-vivo circulatory system with physiological pulsatile flow. 4D flow MR images with 3 set heartrates (HR; 60 bpm, 80 bpm and 100 bpm) were acquired. False lumen volume per cycle (FLV), mean and peak systolic WSS were determined from 4D flow MRI data. For validation, the experiment was repeated with a second porcine aorta dissection model. Results: During both experiments an increase in FLV (initial experiment: Delta FLV = 2.05 ml, p < 0.001, repeated experiment: Delta FLV = 1.08 ml, p = 0.005) and peak WSS (initial experiment: Delta WSS = 1.2 Pa, p = 0.004, repeated experiment: Delta WSS = 1.79 Pa, p = 0.016) was observed when HR increased from 60 to 80 bpm. Raising the HR from 80 to 100 bpm, no significant increase in FLV (p = 0.073, p = 0.139) was seen during both experiments. The false lumen mean WSS increased significant during initial (2.71 to 3.85 Pa; p = 0.013) and non-significant during repeated experiment (3.22 to 4.00 Pa; p = 0.320). Conclusion: 4D flow MRI provides insight into hemodynamic dimensions including WSS. Our ex-vivo experiments showed that an increase in HR from 60 to 80 bpm resulted in a significant increase of FLV and WSS of the false lumen. We suggest that strict heart rate control is of major importance to reduce the mean and peak WSS in uncomplicated acute TBAD. Because of the limitations of an ex-vivo study, 4D flow MRI will have to be performed in clinical setting to determine whether this imaging model would be of value to predict the course of uncomplicated TBAD.

J	Hakkenbrak, NAG; Truijers, M				Hakkenbrak, Nadia A. G.; Truijers, Maarten			Life-Threatening Non-Allergic Drug Hypersensitivity Reaction as a Very Rare Side Effect of Rivaroxaban Administration in the Netherlands	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						rivaroxaban; non-allergic drug hypersensitivity reaction; anaphylaxis; anaphylactoid reaction		Background: Anticoagulant therapy is indicated for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are frequently prescribed and Rivaroxaban is the most frequently administered DOAC in the Netherlands. Most side effects relate to hemorrhagic complications, however, also non-hemorrhagic side effect may be potentially life threatening. Case presentation: A 74-year-old man presented at the emergency department with a ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm for which open aneurysm repair was performed. Postoperatively, the patient developed neurological deficit, respiratory and circulatory failure following rivaroxaban administration, initiated for atrial fibrillation. Even though, the clinical signs resembled an anaphylactic reaction, the skin-prick test was negative and complications most likely resulted from a non-allergic drug hypersensitivity reaction. Conclusion: This case report shows that non-allergic drug hypersensitivity reactions may mimic an anaphylactic reaction and can be potentially life threatening. In addition, severe non-hemorrhagic complications after rivaroxaban administration do occur and should be considered in case of acute clinical deterioration.	[Hakkenbrak, Nadia A.

It is not confirmed what the pathophysiology is that causes this pain, but the proposed mechanism is the iatrogenic damage of sympathetic fibers that extend from the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) to innervate the parotid gland. The presentation of this syndrome has been acknowledged in patients who have undergone head and neck tumor resections, but it has not been documented in the same thorough manner among vascular surgery cases in the parapharyngeal space, possibly because of a higher risk of development in other head and neck surgeries, or to under-reporting of cases. To date, only 5 cases of FBS status post carotid endarterectomy have been documented in the literature. Definitive treatment of FBS has not been established. Some studies have shown improvement with amitriptyline, and carbamazepine as well as botulinum toxin injections. We will present the case of a 75 year old male who developed first bite syndrome after a right carotid endarterectomy with efforts of raising awareness of a potential acute complication of carotid endarterectomy.

We evaluated the safety of CFA access and the ease of sheath insertion over time after EA. Method We included 19 patients (21 limbs, 40 cases) in whom the CFA was used after EA with autologous repair as an access route in EVT for peripheral arterial disease in our institution from January 2013 to December 2020. Nine limbs underwent simple closure repair and 12 underwent autologous patch repair. Difficult sheath insertions were defined as those in which additional devices (stiff guidewire or a smaller diameter sheath for dilation) were used for scheduled sheath insertion. The inability to insert a sheath with the scheduled diameter was defined as a failed sheath insertion. We evaluated the EVT timing after EA for difficult sheath insertions, and whether the CFA was repaired with simple closure or autologous patch repair during EA surgery. Results There were 10 (25%) difficult sheath insertions, with one (2.5%) failure. The rate of difficult sheath insertions peaked from 6 months to 1 year after EA and gradually decreased (47% from 6 months to 3 years, 14% thereafter). There were more statistically significant difficult sheath insertions with simple closure repair (50%) than with autologous patch repair (12%) (P = 0.018). Hemostasis devices were used in 90% of EVT cases. The median maximum sheath diameter was 6 Fr (mean = 5.8 Fr). None of the cases required surgical procedures to achieve hemostasis after EVT. Conclusion EVT may be performed safely using the CFA after EA. The difficulty of sheath insertion may differ depending on the EVT timing after EA; it was more difficult with simple closure than with autologous patch repair, possibly related to scar formation.

In the present report we described a case of a patient with massive RCC and extensive neoplastic thrombosis reaching the retrohepatic tract of the inferior vena cava. After a discussion in a multidisciplinary team meeting we decided to perform a radical nephrectomy with vena cava thrombectomy along with the support of a novel removable vena cava filter in order to avoid thromboembolism during the surgical procedure. Furthermore, a preoperative renal artery embolization with a non-adhesive liquid embolic agent was performed ahead of the surgical procedure in order to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding. The surgical procedure performed the day after was based on a hybrid endovascular-surgical approach consisting in nephrectomy, liver derotation, cavotomy with the additional use of a novel temporary caval filter, thus reducing the risk of intraoperative thromboembolic dissemination.

While open surgery remains the standard treatment, the endovascular approach is attractive as it may reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality. We report a case of IA blunt injury extending to the subclavian artery with pseudoaneurysm formation successfully treated with covered stenting of IA and its bifurcation. A 49-year-old male was admitted after suffering multiple trauma due to a high energy impact motorcycle crash. In the emergency room, the patient was hypotensive with a Glasgow coma score of 15. On physical examination, he had right peri-orbital ecchymosis, left otorrhagia and an open patella fracture. The computed tomographic angiography (CTA) revealed enlargement of the mediastinum and a 29 mm pseudoaneurysm involving the right brachiocephalic trunk and its bifurcation. Under general anesthesia, a covered balloon-expandable stent (CBES) was then placed in the IA followed by kissing stent of its bifurcation with an additional 2 covered balloon-expandable stents. Final subtraction angiography demonstrated complete pseudoaneurysm exclusion and stent patency without additional complications. No neurologic deficits or other intervention-related complications were found in the postoperative period. At 10 months follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic and with palpable distal pulses. Endovascular management of IA injury may provide a good alternative to open surgery with low perioperative morbidity and mortality.

The endovascular treatment is less invasive, with a minor risk of complications. However, the presence of a highly angulated aortic arch (type III) is a challenge, since the navigation of endovascular devices is not favorable.

Early Characteristics and Progression of Blunt Traumatic Aortic Injuries at a Single Level I Trauma Center	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						aortic injury; blunt trauma; low-grade aortic injury; computed tomography	ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR; THORACIC AORTA; NONOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT; AMERICAN-ASSOCIATION; OPERATIVE REPAIR; OUTCOMES; SURGERY; RUPTURE	Objectives: The most widely accepted grading system for blunt traumatic aortic injury (BTAI) by the Society of Vascular Surgery (SVS) recommends endovascular repair for grade 2 and greater. Non-operative management in grade 2 injuries has been shown to be reasonable in certain circumstances. The natural history of low-grade injuries (1, 2) when managed non-operatively is not well defined. Methods: Utilizing our trauma registry, patients from 2013 to 2016 with blunt traumatic injury who underwent initial computed tomography were identified. Aortic pathology was graded and grouped by SVS classification. Clinical courses were reviewed for timing of interventions, repeat imaging, concurrent injuries, and outcomes. Analysis of variance and Chi-square tests of significance were utilized to compare between groups. Results: Out of 10,178 patients, we identified 32 with BTAI (grade: 1 (n = 13), 2 (n = 5), 3 (n = 3), 4 (n = 11)). High-grade injuries (3, 4) resulted only from motor vehicle, motorcycle, and pedestrian mechanisms. Initially, 9 patients (28%) required intervention, 5 (16%) were treated non-operatively, and 18 (56%) underwent repeat imaging. On repeat imaging, injuries that did not resolve remained stable and no injuries were found to progress. Of these patients, 9 (50%) required delayed intervention and 9 (50%) successfully underwent non-operative management. Patients with low-grade injuries were more likely to have successful non-operative management than those with high-grade injuries (72% vs 7%; p < 0.01). Conclusions: While low-grade injuries generally have good outcomes, some ultimately do require delayed intervention, and short-term imaging is not reliable in identifying these cases.

Methods Between January 2013 and December 2019, 63 patients with SVCO related to NSCLC received stent implantation with (n = 30) or without (n = 33) RSS insertion at our center. The clinical efficacy, stent patency duration, and overall survival (OS) were compared between these two groups. Results Both groups achieved 100% clinical and technical success rates. There were no obstacles associated with the procedure performed for the patients. Two patients in the RSS group and 7 patients in the stent-alone group experienced stent re-stenosis. The rate of re-stenosis between the two groups was not significantly different (P = .099). Patients in the RSS group had significantly longer median patency than those in the stent-alone group (381 vs 309 days, P = .045). All patients died because of the development of tumors during the follow-up. Patients in the RSS group had a significantly longer median OS than those in the stent-alone group (229 vs 178 days, P = .026). During the follow-up, no patient in the RSS group suffered RSS migration or brachytherapy-related complications. Conclusion For patients with SVCO secondary to NSCLC, a stent with RSS insertion is efficacious and safe, and it may improve stent patency and OS.

Immediate intervention is warranted in massive hemoptysis due to high mortality. Various causes of massive hemoptysis are TB, bronchiectasis, aspergilloma, lung abscess, lung cancer, necrotizing pneumonia, and cystic fibrosis. Active pulmonary TB as well as chronic pulmonary TB can manifest with massive hemoptysis. Hemoptysis in active TB occurs due to ulceration in bronchiolar wall, eroding the wall of the adjacent BA or pulmonary artery, and in chronic TB due to hypertrophied bronchial arteries, or bronchiectasis, or aspergilloma. Herein, we report a case of pulmonary TB causing intrapulmonary BA pseudoaneurysm in a young male patient who presented with acute massive hemoptysis. The BA pseudoaneurysm as well as other hypertrophied bronchial arteries were embolized using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles.

Methods We report a case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with upper airway obstruction, who had profuse bleeding, post-tracheostomy, from the stomal site. CT angiography showed presence of a pseudoaneurysm adjacent to the tracheostomy site which was confirmed on catheter angiography to be arising from anomalous thymic branch of right common carotid artery (CCA). Superselective cannulation of the anomalous thymic artery was done using a microcatheter with subsequent coil embolization. Results Post-coiling, the bleeding stopped immediately and the patient recovered. He was under oncology care till 3 months following embolization and was doing well. Conclusions The emergency physicians should be aware of this rare variation of thymic artery while performing tracheostomy. Ultrasound as point-of-care device may help mitigate these complications. Endovascular embolization is a minimally invasive and effective management option for an injured arterial branch from a tracheostomy.

About 160 cases can be found in literature, but presentation in a patient with post-endarterectomy stenting has not been reported. Most frequent clinical manifestations include the occurrence of a sinus, a pseudoaneurysm, or neck swelling, but in severe cases it may present anastomosis dehiscence with hematoma or hemorrhage. Usually, patch removal and reconstruction is recommended, but there is not a standard protocol for management. Conservative surgical management with patch preservation has only been reported in a minority of cases. We report a patient with a history of carotid endarterectomy and subsequent carotid stenting 21 months later because of >80% restenosis. He presented a sinus in the scar 81 months after the former intervention. The patient underwent surgery, and during the procedure, a detachment of a small segment of the Dacron patch from the surrounding tissue was found. The sinus tract was resected, and after verifying the integrity of the patch, it was irrigated with rifampicin and preserved in situ. S. epidermidis was isolated from tissue cultures. Twenty-four months later, the patient remains asymptomatic and duplex ultrasound shows no signs of infection. Conservative surgical approach can be a valid option for treatment and may be considered in selected patients with limited infection.

Owing to the gradual growth of the false lumen, we planned to deploy a stent to the celiac artery dissection and embolize the PDA aneurysm. Prior to stent placement, we assessed the acute celiac artery dissection distal to the stenosis using four-dimensional computed tomography (CT) angiography through expiration/inspiration/expiration cycle. We diagnosed median arcuate ligament syndrome considering that the celiac axis showed a hooked narrowing at end-expiration, and the compression decreased at end-inspiration. Additionally, the true lumen distal to the stretched axis dilated in the inspiration phase. Therefore, we could advance a catheter into the true lumen during inspiration and successfully deploy a stent. Subsequently, laparoscopic median arcuate ligament release was performed after the stent deployment. A postoperative CT scan showed good patency in the stent, with disappearance of the blood filling the false lumen and with reduced celiac axis stenosis.

Open Surgical Secondary Interventions are More Durable than Endovascular Interventions for Lower Extremity Bypass Stenosis or Occlusion	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						lower extremity bypass; limb ischemia; angioplasty	INFRAINGUINAL BYPASS; VEIN GRAFTS; BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; PREVENT-III; THROMBOLYSIS; REVISION; EFFICACY	Objectives: Lower extremity bypasses often require secondary interventions to maintain patency. Our objectives were to characterize effectiveness of secondary interventions to maintain or restore bypass graft patency, and to compare outcomes of open and endovascular interventions. Methods: We reviewed patients who underwent lower extremity bypass at our institution from 2007 to 2010. We recorded the index bypass and subsequent ipsilateral interventions performed through 2018 or until loss of secondary patency. Patient, procedure, and anatomic data were collected. Endovascular intervention was compared with open/hybrid intervention. For outcome analysis, patency measures were defined relative to the time of the secondary intervention rather than the time of the index bypass. Results: 174 secondary interventions (56 open/hybrid, 118 endovascular; 42 for graft occlusion, and 132 for stenosis) treating 228 lesions in 97 bypasses were available for study. The index bypass was most commonly performed for tissue loss (71.1%), utilized a tibial artery target (57.7%), and used single-segment great saphenous vein (59.8%) rather than alternative vein (32.0%) or prosthetic (8.2%). A higher portion of open/hybrid interventions (51.8%) were done for graft occlusion than endovascular interventions (11.0%, P < .001). Mean follow-up for secondary interventions was 3.5 years. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model identified female gender, prior MI, anticoagulation, occlusion, and endovascular intervention as predictors of loss of primary patency. Intervention for occlusion predicted poorer primary and secondary patency. Endovascular intervention was associated with poorer primary patency as compared to open intervention and a trend toward poorer secondary patency. Conclusions: Both open and endovascular secondary interventions on lower extremity bypasses are low-risk procedures that offer acceptable patency. Although more commonly performed in the setting of graft occlusion, open surgical interventions show improved durability compared to endovascular interventions. Some patients, including those with occluded grafts, may benefit from more liberal use of open surgical intervention to restore bypass patency.

Materials and Methods: Between November 2009 and November 2011, 16 patients with aortic arch dissections underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair utilizing customized unibody single-branched fenestrated stent-graft (UBFSG) in our institution. Results: All 16 patients were male with mean age of 54.50 +/- 11.33. The technical success rate was 100%. 30-day mortality rate was 6.25% (n = 1). The median follow-up period was 98 months (range, 0-119). During follow-up, 4 nonaorta-related deaths were recorded. Two (2) cases of left subclavian artery occlusion were observed 12 and 14 months after the operation. Two (2) patients had another successful endovascular repair in time, including one case of type Ib endoleak occurred 100 months after the operation and one case of stent-graft induced new entry tear 38 months after the operation. No stroke and migration of stent-grafts were observed. Conclusions: The branched fenestrated stent-graft may be an effective alternative treatment for aortic arch dissections unfit for open surgery.

Covered Stents for Endovascular Treatment of Aortoiliac Occlusive Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Review						AIOD; aortoiliac occlusive disease; covered stent; bare metal stent; endovascular treatment; therapy	SELF-EXPANDING STENTS; BARE-METAL STENT; AORTIC BIFURCATION; KISSING STENTS; SURGICAL RECONSTRUCTION; EXPANDABLE STENTS; EDITORS CHOICE; OUTCOMES; TASC; EXPERIENCE	Purpose: The treatment of aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) has largely shifted to endovascular techniques, with primary stenting constituting the preferred treatment approach. The goal of the current study was to summarize available literature and to determine whether covered stents are superior to bare metal stents for the treatment of AIOD, in terms of both periprocedural and long-term outcomes. Methods: A meta-analysis of 47 studies was conducted with the use of random effects modeling. The incidence of adverse events during follow up among the individual included studies was synthesized. Results: Most of the lesions were located at the common iliac arteries and were chronic total occlusions. The procedure was technically successful in almost all cases in both groups, with a low rate of periprocedural complications observed in both groups. The reported primary patency rates for the non-covered and covered stent group during an average follow up of 24.3 months among the individual studies, were 84% and 92% respectively, while surgical or endovascular re-intervention was required in 10% of non-covered stent cases and in 6% of covered stent cases. Eight studies comparing covered vs non-covered stents in terms of patency demonstrated superiority of covered stents (OR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.01-6.01; p = 0.047 Combining TASC C/D lesions together 12 studies reported 92% (95%CI:89%-95%) primary patency in the covered stent group, while 7 studies reported 75% (95%CI: 60%-88%) primary patency for cases treated with non-covered stents. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that covered stents are safe and effective when utilized for the treatment of AIOD. Covered stents were associated with a statistically significant higher odds of primary patency in both the overall cohort and in more complex TASC C/D lesions. However, additional high-quality comparative analyses between covered vs bare metal stents and between several types of covered stents are needed to determine the most optimal treatment modality for AIOD.

J	Gu, GC; Liu, ZL; Song, XT; Zheng, YH				Gu, Guangchao; Liu, Zhili; Song, Xitao; Zheng, Yuehong			Surgical Excision of a Functional Carotid Body Tumor Presenting Intraoperative Hypertensive Crisis: A Case Report and Literature Review	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Review						carotid body tumor; paraganglioma; functional; catecholamine; surgery		Carotid body tumor (CBT) is a rare neoplasm arising from the carotid bifurcation. Functional CBTs are extremely rare and are usually associated with elevated serum catecholamine and catecholamine-induced symptoms such as paroxysmal hypertension, palpitations, dizziness, flushing and tachycardia. We reported a 47-year-old female with a functional CBT that was biochemically silent and had no catecholamine-induced symptoms preoperatively, but experienced hypertensive crisis during surgical excision of the lesion. Postoperative pathology confirmed the diagnosis of CBT, and a functional tumor was considered due to the hypertensive crisis during surgical manipulation of the lesion. Under careful management of intraoperative blood pressure and close monitoring of vital sign along with adequate crystalloid infusion after surgery, the tumor was successfully excised and the patient recovered uneventfully during a follow-up period of 12 months. To the best of our knowledge, this is an unusual report of functional CBT presenting merely hypertensive crisis during surgery, with no elevated serum catecholamine or catecholamine-induced symptoms preoperatively. Clinicians should be aware of such lesions so that appropriate medication and gentle manipulation are given when encountering hypertensive crisis during surgical excision of CBTs, to prevent life-threatening cardiovascular complications. The appropriate management and recognition of functional CBTs were also discussed by means of a review of the literature.

The Utility of Duplex Ultrasonography Surveillance in Identify Failing Aortobifemoral Grafts	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						surveillance; aortobifemoral graft; duplex imaging; failing graft		Objective: The Society for Vascular Surgery stated there are a lack of studies describing long-term surveillance for aortobifemoral (AoBF) bypasses. Our goal was to investigate the value of DU studies as a surveillance tool for AoBF bypasses. Methods: We retrospectively identified patients in our prospectively maintained database who underwent AoBF bypasses between 1995-2018. Surveillance was performed routinely with DU post-operatively, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually. We considered "abnormal" DU findings to include peri-graft fluid, pseudoaneurysm or, peak systolic velocities (PSVs) > 350 cm/sec or PSV ratio > 3.5 anywhere from the proximal aortic to distal femoral anastomosis. If abnormalities were identified patients underwent intervention or shorter surveillance intervals. Results: Of 153 AoBF bypasses, 60 patients with 120 graft limbs fulfilled our post-operative surveillance protocol with a mean follow-up of 4.0 years (0.5-24 years). "Normal" DU surveillance studies were documented throughout follow-up in 112 (93%) limbs. Of these, 2 (1.7%) developed acute limb occlusion. Eight (6.7%) limbs had "abnormal" DU findings: 5 failing grafts with focal elevated PSVs, 2 with peri-graft fluid leading to a diagnosis of an infected graft, and 1 with a pseudoaneurysm (PSA). Contrast arteriography or CT-angiography confirmed > 75% diameter stenosis, fluid or PSA in all 8 limbs. Graft revision (5 endovascular, 2 surgical) was performed in 7 of the 8 limbs initially or after 2 successive "abnormal" DU studies within 6 weeks of each other; 1 patient refused intervention. Without surveillance, urgent or emergent treatment might have proved necessary in 7.5% (7 + 2 = 9/120) of cases instead of only 1.7% (2/120) of cases. Conclusion: Vascular surgeons should adopt DU as a useful surveillance tool to identify AoBF bypasses that are failing or have other problems not identified clinically. Persistence of "abnormal" DU findings should prompt operative or endovascular intervention.

We therefore sought to determine the impact of this on the surgical experience of vascular trainees. Methods: Surgical case volume, breadth, and the participating trainee post-graduate level from 3 large New York City Hospitals with integrated residency and fellowship programs (Mount Sinai, Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and New York University) were reviewed. Procedures performed between February 26 to March 25, 2020 (pre-pandemic month) and March 26 to April 25, 2020 (peak pandemic period) were compared to those performed during the same time period in 2019. The trainees from these programs were also sent surveys to evaluate their subjective experience during this time. Results: The total number of cases during the month leading into the peak pandemic period was 635 cases in 2019 and 560 cases in 2020 (12% decrease). During the peak pandemic period, case volume decreased from 445 in 2019 to 114 in 2020 (74% reduction). The highest volume procedures during the peak pandemic month in 2020 were amputations and peripheral cases for acute limb ischemia; during the 2019 period, the most common cases were therapeutic endovascular procedures. There was a decrease in case volume for vascular senior residents of 77% and vascular junior and midlevel residents of 75%. There was a 77% survey response rate with 50% of respondents in the senior years of training. Overall, 20% of respondents expressed concern about completing ACGME requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Vascular surgery-specific clinical educational and operative experiences during redeployment efforts have been limited. Further efforts should be directed to quantify the impact on training and to evaluate the efficacy of training supplements such as teleconferences and simulation.

Chest CT images showed bilateral ground glass opacities, bilateral pulmonary embolism, right ventricular clot in transit and 2 thoracic aortic mural thrombus. Therapy was initiated with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin, and the patient was discharged at 20 days asymptomatic. Complete resolution of the aortic thrombus was observed in a 1-month surveillance CT angiogram. Our case illustrates vascular complications in a COVID-19 patient and its effective treatment with anticoagulation.

In this experimental study, we evaluated the effects of naftidrofuryl and cilostazol in ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury on various tissues. Materials and Methods: 40 male albino Wistar rats (8-12 weeks old, 250-350 g.) are randomly divided into 4 groups: Control (Group 1), sham (group 2), cilostazol pre-treatment (group 3), naftidrofuryl pre-treatment (group 4). During 21 days placebo is given to group 2, 12 mg/kg/day cilostazol is given to group 3, 50 mg/kg/day naftidrofuryl is given to group 4 orally. Ischemia and reperfusion are induced at the lower hind limb in Groups 2, 3 and 4. Ischemic muscle, kidney, liver, heart, brain and blood samples are obtained. The total antioxidant capacity, oxidant levels and oxidative stress index are studied for each group. Results: Both drugs have protective effects of remote organ injury following IR. Systemic effects are similar to each other, both have protective effects of IR injury. It showed no statistical significance in the total antioxidant capacity. Total oxidant levels are significantly affected by cilostazol in the heart (p < 0.01) and by naftidrofuryl in the liver (p < 0.01). The effect on oxidative stress was only significant with cilostazol on the heart (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Cilostazol and naftidrofuryl had beneficial effects in all tissues against tissue damage caused by IR injury. In ischemic muscle, kidney and heart cilostazol had improved outcomes comparing to naftidrofuryl. Naftidrofuryl had benefits over cilostazol in liver tissue.

However, tumor thrombus extension into the right atrium harbors the potential risk of stent migration and perforation. One strategy to avoid this potential life-threatening complication could be the placement of a bridging stent from the superior vena cava-to-inferior vena cava. This case reports describes the superior vena cava-to-inferior vena cava bridging stent technique in 2 patients with malignant occlusion of the superior and inferior vena cava. Special considerations such as technical details of the devices and potential complications are discussed.

Transposed brachiobasilic fistula (BBF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG) becomes an option when radiocephalic or brachiocephalic fistula cannot be created or fails. This study compared the patency and complications between BBFs and AVGs among patients on hemodialysis. Methods: A retrospective study was performed in Shuang Ho Hospital, Taiwan, from November 2015 to May 2020. All the operations were done by a single surgeon. Primary outcomes were primary patency, primary-assisted patency, and secondary patency of the BBF and AVG groups. Secondary outcomes were incidence of complications and reinterventions. Results: Of the 144 consecutive patients, 20 and 124 patients underwent BBF and AVG creation, respectively. Median follow-up time was 19.2 months. Primary patency at 1 and 2 years were 67% and 19% in the BBF group and 44% and 16% in the AVG group (P = 0.126). Primary-assisted patency at 1 and 2 years were 82% and 54% in the BBF group and 54% and 30% in the AVG group (P = 0.012). Secondary patency at 1 and 2 years were 100% and 82% in the BBF group and 81% and 67% in the AVG group (P = 0.078). The incidence of complication was significantly higher in the AVG than in the BBF group (1.7 per patient-year vs 0.93, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Compared with the AVG group, BBF group showed better primary-assisted patency, less complication and intervention rates. Therefore, BBF is a reliable option for patients with exhausted cephalic veins if basilic vein is available for reconstruction.

Readmission and Utilization After Repair of Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms in the United States	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA); readmission; vascular surgery; outcomes; disparities		Objectives: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has emerged as a less invasive alternative to open repair for ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (rAAA), but comparisons to traditional open rAAA repair and late complications leading to readmission are limited. Materials and Methods: Hospitalizations for patients undergoing repair for rAAA were selected from the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD). In-hospital mortality, complications, 30-day readmission, readmission diagnoses, and charges were evaluated. Design-adjusted chi-square, Wilcoxon test, and logistic regression were used for analysis. Results: During 2014-2016, 3,629 open rAAA and 5,037 EVAR were identified. The index mortality rate was 21.4% for EVAR vs. 33.5% for open (p < .0001). Median index length of stay (LOS) was 4.9 days for EVAR vs. 8.6 days for open repair (p < 0.001). All-cause 30-day readmission after rAAA was higher following EVAR (18.9%) than open (14.3%, p = .007). Time to readmission and charges for readmission stays did not differ between procedure groups. Respiratory complications were more common following open repair than EVAR (20.4% vs 11.4%, respectively; p = .008). Patients who underwent open repair suffered more infectious complications than patients treated with EVAR during readmission (49.2% vs 39.8%, respectively; p = 0.054). In multivariable analysis, factors associated with readmission included having EVAR during the index stay (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-1.88; p = .003), increased length of index stay (OR = 1.01; 95% CI 1.01-1.02; p = 0.002), chronic kidney disease (OR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.18-1.94; p = .001), and coronary artery disease (OR = 1.32; 95% CI 1.02-1.71; p = .034). Aggregate readmission charges totaled $79 million. Readmissions were most often infectious complications for both repair types. Conclusions: EVAR was used more often than open repair for rAAA. In-hospital mortality and length of the index stay were significantly lower following EVAR. After multivariable adjustment, the odds of readmission were 1.5 times higher after EVAR, costing the health system more over time when prevalence and readmission are considered. Coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and index length of stay were also associated with 30-day readmission. Further investigation into reasons why a less invasive procedure, EVAR, has a higher readmission rate and understanding post-discharge infectious complications may help lower overall health care utilization after rAAA.

He did not tolerate the stress of general anesthesia due to severe pulmonary function impairment. Therefore, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in zone 3 was performed under epidural anesthesia. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed another leakage into the aneurysmal sac in zone 1 after performing TEVAR. Because open surgical repair and debranching TEVAR were contraindicated, transcatheter arterial embolization was performed with careful consideration of his comorbidities. Follow-up contrast-enhanced CT performed 2 weeks after embolization indicated no opacification of the aneurysmal sac, and noncontrast-enhanced CT a year after embolization showed no dilatation of the aneurysmal sac.

On the fifteenth day after the onset of symptoms, he had typical CT findings in polyarteritis nodosa involving only the hepatic arteries. Transcatheter arterial coil embolization of the right hepatic artery was performed due to ruptured hepatic aneurysms. Combination therapy with antibiotics and antihypertensives was administrated after embolization. The intrahepatic aneurysms completely vanished and inflammatory biomarkers returned to normal on the tenth day after embolization. The current case highlights the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial-infection-associated polyarteritis nodosa involving only the hepatic arteries, coexisting with hypertension.

Methods: We describe a case of a UAF associated with previous aorto-biiliac grafting, ureteric stenting and right nephrectomy because of chronic pielonephritis and complicated by surgical site infection. This case illustrates a very complex pathology, with a challenging diagnosis and multiple treatment options. Results: A 72 year-old woman was referred to Vilnius Vascular Unit for open UAF repair. The patient had a history of open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair using a bifurcated graft 25 years ago. The right ureter was injured during the operation and a rigid indwelling ureteric stent was inserted. Six months prior to referral, she underwent a right nephrectomy due to a chronic pyelonephritis, complicated by surgical site infection, which was still present at the time of admission. Initial CTA demonstrated bilateral iliac aneurysms, but no signs of UAF. A further CTA revealed a UAF between the right ureteral stump and the right common iliac artery (CIA) para-anastomotic aneurysm. After unsuccessful attempts to embolize the UAF using both coils and glue, the patient was referred to Vilnius Vascular Unit for open repair. Left axillo-bifemoral bypass reconstruction was performed followed by UAF repair and bifurcated graft explantation. Follow-up after 2 years showed no recurrence of haematuria, good function of the remaining kidney and patent axillo-bifemoral bypass with no signs of infection around the prosthetic aortic stump. Conclusions: Uretero-arterial fistula is a uncommon condition in everyday clinical practice. The rarity of this condition may lead to delayed or missed diagnosis which can result in life-threating consequences. A multidisciplinary approach involving urologists, vascular surgeon and radiologist are crucial to both the diagnosis and managment of this rare entity.

To our knowledge, there have been no reports on the application of ISLF for delayed revascularization of the LSA previously sealed in TEVAR. This report describes 5 patients who underwent ISLF for delayed LSA revascularization, with a technical success rate of 80%. No endoleakage occurred, and stents remained patent during more than 6-month follow-up. ISLF is an effective, safe and minimally invasive method for delayed revascularization of the LSA following TEVAR for type B aortic dissection (TBAD) when patients are selected appropriately.

Endovascular interventions have been attempted, but reports have been anecdotal. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the outcomes of endovascular management of TIF by pooling the existing evidence. Methods: An electronic database search of Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was performed to identify all studies examining endovascular treatment of TIF. Patients greater than 14 years of age who underwent endovascular intervention for TIF were included. 25 studies consisting of 27 patients met the inclusion criteria. Results: 48.1% (13/27) of patients were male and median age was 39.0 [IQR 16.0, 47.5] years. Tracheostomy was present in 96.3% (26/27) of cases. Median duration from tracheostomy to TIF presentation was 2.2 months [0.5, 42.5]. On presentation, 84.6% (22/26) had tracheal hemorrhage, and 22.8% (6/27) were hemodynamically unstable. 96.3% (26/27) underwent covered stent graft placement while 1 patient (3.8%) had coil embolization. 18.5% (5/27) of patients required repeat endovascular intervention for recurrent bleeding, while 11.1% (3/27) required rescue sternotomy. Median hospital length of stay was 30 days [16.0, 46.5], and overall mortality was 29.6% (8/27) with a median follow-up time of 5 months [1.2, 11.5]. Conclusion: While uncommon, endovascular treatment of TIF may be a feasible alternative to sternotomy. The approach may be useful in those who are unable to undergo surgery or are likely to have adhesions from prior chest operations.

Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature (database searched: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library; last search: April 2020). We included articles reporting on the outcomes for IIIAA interventions comprising at least 5 patients. Studies were included when presenting extractable outcome data regarding intraoperative and/or early results. We performed meta-analyses of proportions for different outcomes, using random effects model. Results: Thirteen non-randomized studies were included (192 patients with 202 IIIAA). IIIAA were symptomatic in the 18.1% (95%CI 9.3-26.9; I-2 54.46%, P = .019). Estimated mean IIIAA diameter was 46.28 mm (95%CI 39.72-52.85; I-2 88.85%, P < .001). Open repair was performed in 21/202 cases. Endovascular treatments were: embolization (81/181), embolization and hypogastric artery coverage (79/181), hypogastric artery coverage by stent-grafting (15/181), stent-grafting in the hypogastric artery (6/181). Overall estimated technical success (TS) rate was 91.6% (95% CI 86.8-95.5; I-2 45.82%, P = .031). TS rate was 94.5% for open surgery (95%CI 85.3-100; I-2 0%, P = .907), and 89.7% for endovascular repair (95%CI 83.8-95.6; I-2 55.43%, P = .006). Estimated overall 30-day mortality was 3.1% (95%CI 0.8-5.4; I-2 0%, P = .969). Mortality rates after open surgery and endovascular repair were 8.2% (95%CI 3.4-19.8; I-2 0%, P = .545) and 2.8% (95%CI 0.5-5.1; I-2 0%, P = .994), respectively. Estimated mean follow-up was 32.63 months (95%CI 21.74-43.53; I-2 94.45%, P < .001). During this timeframe, IIIAA exclusion was preserved in 92.8% of the patients (95%CI 89.3-96.2; I-2 0%, P = .797). Buttock claudication occurred in 13.9% of the patients (95%CI 8.7-19.2; I-2 0%, P = .622). Conclusions: IIIAA are frequently large, and symptomatic at presentation. Several treatments are proposed in literature, open and endovascular, both with good results. The endovascular treatment is the preferred method of treatment in literature, since it offers good short- to mid-term results and low early mortality. Buttock claudication after hypogastric artery exclusion is a common complication.

Outcomes of Type II Endoleak Treatment Using Ethylene Vinyl Alcohol Copolymer (Onyx(TM))	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						type 2 endoleak; Onyx (TM); endovascular; abdominal aortic aneurysm; embolization; sac volume	ABDOMINAL AORTIC-ANEURYSM; INFERIOR MESENTERIC-ARTERY; ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR; COIL EMBOLIZATION; FOLLOW-UP; DIAMETER; SURVIVAL; PREVENTION; MANAGEMENT; OCCLUDE	Introduction: This study reports our experience with the use of an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx (TM)) for the treatment of type II endoleak after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) in comparison to coils and cyanoacrylate glue. Methods: Clinical data of all patients treated for type II endoleak following EVAR between 2009 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) diameter and AAA sac volume during follow-up were measured using computed tomography angiography (CTA). Treatment failure variables were created for the change in sac diameter and volume. An increase in sac diameter >= 5 mm was considered a failure, as was an increase >= 10% in AAA sac volume. Results: 35 patients underwent treatment for a persistent type II endoleak following EVAR. Of these patients, 18 (51.4%) were treated with Onyx and 17 (48.6%) were treated with coils +/- cyanoacrylate glue embolization. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to demographics. The average volume of Onyx used per treatment was 13.4 ml (range 4.5 ml- 39 ml). There was no difference in efficacy between the Onyx and non-Onyx group. Complications were limited to 1 non-target embolization without significant clinical sequelae. Conclusions: Ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx (TM)) embolization is similarly effective compared to traditional cyanoacrylate glue or coil embolization in the treatment of type II endoleak after EVAR.

Mechanical Thrombectomy in Pulmonary Embolism Associated with COVID-19: A "Clotography" Gallery	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Editorial Material						pulmonary embolectomy; mechanical thrombectomy; pulmonary embolism; COVID-19; venous thromboembolism		Venous thromboembolism from a "thrombotic storm"-like syndrome is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with active or "recovered" COVID-19. Patients should be risk-stratified, optimally by a pulmonary embolism (PE) response team (PERT), and considered for escalation of care if found with intermediate or high-risk PE.

A 73-year-old man underwent percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage placement in another hospital, complicated by haemobilia and development of a RHA PsA. Endovascular embolization was attempted, resulting in coil embolization of the proper hepatic artery, and persistence of the PsA. At this point, the patient was referred to our hospital. Computed tomography and direct angiography confirmed the iatrogenic extra-hepatic PsA of the RHA, refilled by small collaterals from the accessory left hepatic artery (LHA) and coil occlusion of the proper hepatic artery. Attempted selective catheterization of these vessels was unsuccessful due to the tortuosity and very small caliber of the intra-hepatic collaterals, the latter precluding endovascular treatment of the PsA. Percutaneous trans-hepatic combined fluoroscopic and ultrasound-guided embolization of the PsA was performed with Lipiodol (R) and cyanoacrylate-based glue (Glubran (R) 2). Real time fluoroscopic images and computed tomography confirmed complete occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm. Surgical repair, although feasible, was considered at high risk. In our patient, we decided to perform a percutaneous trans-hepatic combined fluoroscopic and ultrasound-guided embolization of the PsA using a mix of Lipiodol (R) and Glubran (R) 2 because of the fast polymerization time of the glue allowing the complete occlusion of the PsA in few seconds, thus eliminating the risk of coil migration, reducing the risk of PsA rupture and avoid a difficult surgical repair.

There is some controversy regarding the long-term effect of this on renal function. We describe the case of a 37-year-old gentleman who underwent an elective aorto-bifemoral bypass for aorto-iliac occlusive disease with symptoms of short distance claudication, with intra-operative ligation of the left renal vein. This was complicated by post-operative acute renal failure and haematuria, with CT findings of left renal venous dilatation and peri-renal stranding. The patient underwent successful left renocaval bypass with reversed great saphenous vein, with subsequent resolution of haematuria and improvement in renal function. The syndrome of acute renal failure and haematuria is a rare but possible complication of left renal vein ligation during aortic surgery, and restoration of renal venous outflow via renocaval bypass in this instance was an effective method of treating this complication.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of sirolimus in treating complex head and neck (H&N) LFVM that were challenging and/or refractory to standard treatment. Methods: Each patient had baseline and 6-months assessments consisting of clinical history and examination, quality of life (QoL) questionnaires, laboratory investigations, MRI and medical photography. Patients were followed up 1-week and then 1-monthly for 6-months. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare pre-and 6-months treatment in all 8 domains of RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and visual analog score for pain (VAS-P). P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Seven patients (median age 43 years, range 23-65 years) were recruited. Six patients completed the six-months course of therapy with 1 patient withdrawing due to intolerable side effects. All six patients reported reduction of swelling with and without other symptom improvement related to the vascular malformations while on treatment. However, at 1-month review after discontinuation of sirolimus, 5 patients reported return of initial symptoms. Overall, patients demonstrated an improvement in QoL six-months treatment but there was no statistical significance (P > 0.05) in all 8 domains of SF-36, HADS and VAS-P. Five patients demonstrated a minimum 10% decrease in lesion size six-months treatment (median 21%, range 13-40%). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that sirolimus treatment did elicit a statistically significant change in lesion size in either direction (Z = -1.992, P = 0.046). The most common side effects found were dyslipidaemia (n-4) and mouth ulcers (n = 2). Conclusion: In our preliminary experience, sirolimus is effective and safe in treating patients with complex H&N LFVM. This provides an alternative treatment where standard treatment is challenging and/or refractory.

J	Li, L; Lao, YH				Li, Long; Lao, Yong-Hao			Massive Hemoptysis Caused by an Aortobronchial Fistula Related to Pedicle Screw Impingement	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						case report; massive hemoptysis; aortobronchial fistula; pedicle screw; percutaneous thoracic endovascular aortic repair		We report a case of a 50-year-old man with a 10-year history of pedicle screw internal fixation in the thoracic spine and heroin abuse, who presented with sudden-onset massive hemoptysis with hemorrhagic shock and asphyxia. Urgent contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) characteristically showed thoracic aortic perforation, a paravertebral pseudoaneurysm, and an intrapulmonary hematoma. Emergency percutaneous thoracic endovascular aortic repair (pTEVAR) with the preclose technique using a vascular closure device under local anesthesia achieved success without any complications. The current case highlights the importance of understanding massive hemoptysis caused by an aortobronchial fistula related to pedicle screw impingement in clinical practice and the value of pTEVAR with the preclose technique under local anesthesia in the emergency setting.

Comparison of Cost and Efficacy of Trufill (R) vs Histoacryl (R) n-Butyl Cyanoacrylate for Translumbar Type 2 Endoleak Embolization	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						endoleak; embolization; type 2 endoleak; n-butyl cyanoacrylate; n-BCA; glue; histoacryl; trufill; EVAR; abdominal aortic aneurysm; AAA		Purpose: The study aimed to compare the cost and efficacy of translumbar approach type 2 endoleak repairs using either Trufill (R) or Histoacryl (R) n-BCA liquid embolic. Method and Materials: This was a retrospective review of patients who had translumbar approach type 2 endoleak repairs using either Trufill (R) or Histoacryl (R). Patients were included if they underwent a technically successful type 2 endoleak repair via a translumbar approach with Trufill (R) or Histoacryl (R) n-BCA. A multivariable analysis was performed with the primary clinical outcome of percent change in aneurysm diameter per month compared. Procedure cost was calculated based on typical materials used. Results: 20 Trufill (R) and 14 Histoacryl (R) patients were included. The mean procedure cost was higher for Trufill (R) ($5,757.30 vs. $1,586.09, p <= 0.001). There was no significant difference between Trufill (R) or Histoacryl (R) patients for age at first embolization, gender, total number of embolizations, number of feeding branches, aneurysm sac size prior to embolization, or residual endoleak at first follow-up. Trufill (R) patients had more coils used (12.0 vs. 4.3, p = 0.0007), less glue used (0.9 vs. 2.1 mL, p < 0.001), longer follow-up duration (33.5 vs. 13.2 months, p = 0.002), more follow-up CT angiograms (CTA) (3.7 vs. 1.9, p = 0.01), and larger excluded aneurysm sac size at most recent CTA (7.1 cm vs. 5.9 cm, p = 0.04). Percent change in sac diameter per month was not significantly different between Trufill (R) and Histoacryl (R) (0.21% vs. -0.25%/month, p = 0.06, respectively). There were no complications. Conclusion: Use of Histoacryl (R) over Trufill (R) n-BCA resulted in significantly less procedural cost while maintaining safety and efficacy.

J	Galas, N; Shahverdyan, R				Galas, Noemi; Shahverdyan, Robert			Use of the Surfacer (R) Inside-Out (R) Catheter Access System to Obtain Central Venous Access in Dialysis Patients With Thoracic Venous Obstructions: Single-Center Series	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						hemodialysis; kidney failure; Surfacer; Inside-Out; thoracic central venous obstruction		Background: Thoracic central venous obstruction (TCVO) is a common condition which can impact the ability to achieve central venous access (CVA) in patients on hemodialysis. The Surfacer(R) Inside-Out(R) Catheter Access System is designed to enable repeated right-side central venous access in patients with TCVO. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 10 dialysis patients who presented with TCVO and underwent the Inside-Out procedure with the Surfacer System to obtain CVA between 2017 and 2020. Patient demographics, hemodialysis vascular access history, and procedural data were identified and analyzed. The mean patient age was 62.4 +/- 19.6 years (25.9-89.1 years) with 7 of the 10 patients being male. Eight patients (80.0%) were diagnosed with chronic kidney disease with time on hemodialysis ranging from 3 to 13 years. The remaining 2 required CVA to treat acute-on-chronic kidney injury due to septic shock. Patients in our series had a mean of 2.8 +/- 1.6 previous catheters placed prior to the Surfacer procedure. Results: CVA was achieved in all 10 patients with 1 patient requiring a second attempt to achieve access due to the inability to initially traverse the iliac vein with the device, possibly due to a history of kidney transplantation. One multimorbid patient died shortly after the successful procedure, possibly due to cardiac decompensation. Mean total procedure time for the 7 patients having only dialysis catheter placement using the Surfacer device was 67.2 +/- 19.1 minutes (49-103 minutes). The remaining 3 patients received a Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow (HeRO) graft in conjunction with the Inside-Out procedure. All vascular accesses functioned properly during the immediate time period following placement. No adverse events associated with the use of Surfacer device were encountered. Conclusions: Data presented from our patient series confirms the effectiveness of the Surfacer System to safely achieve CVA in dialysis patients with TCVOs with a history of multiple catheter placements.

Utilization Rates of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Vascular Procedures Among Patients Undergoing Lower Extremity Amputations in a Rural Community Hospital: A Clinicopathological Correlation	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						amputation; endovascular revascularization; surgical revascularization; critical limb ischemia; peripheral artery disease		Background: Significant geographical variations exist in amputation rates and utilization of diagnostic and therapeutic vascular procedures before lower extremity amputations in the United States. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the rates of diagnostic and therapeutic vascular procedures in the year prior to amputation in a contemporary population and correlate with pathological findings of the amputation specimens. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of non-traumatic amputations from 2011 to 2017 at a rural community hospital. We reviewed the proportion of patients undergoing diagnostic (ankle brachial index with duplex ultrasound, computerized tomography angiogram and invasive angiogram) and therapeutic (endovascular and surgical revascularization) vascular procedures in the year prior to amputation. Prevalence of tissue viability and osteomyelitis were evaluated in all amputated specimens and atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASVD) was evaluated in major amputations. We also analyzed primary amputation rates among different subgroups. Results: 698 patients were included with 248 (36%) major amputations and 450 (64%) minor amputations. Any diagnostic procedure was performed in 59% of the major amputations and 49% of the minor amputations (P = 0.01). Any therapeutic revascularization procedure was performed in 34% of the major amputations and 28% of the minor amputations (P = 0.08). The pathology of major amputation specimens revealed severe ASVD in 57% and mild-moderate ASVD in 27% of specimens. Tissue viability was significantly higher in major amputations (90% vs 30%, P = 0.04) and osteomyelitis was significantly higher in minor amputations (50% vs 14%, P = 0.03). Primary amputations were performed in 66% of major amputations, 72% of minor amputations, 81% with mild to moderate ASVD and 54% with severe ASVD. Conclusion: Diagnostic and therapeutic vascular procedures appear under-utilized for patients undergoing lower extremity amputations at a rural community hospital. ASVD rates and tissue viability imply that revascularization could be of significant benefit to avoid major amputation.

A 78-year-old man was admitted to our institution with dysarthria and disturbance of gait. MRI revealed occlusion of the BA with acute ischemic change in bilateral cerebellum and brain stem. At 36 hours after onset and 30 hours after administration, EVT was performed because of deteriorating neurological symptom. Successful revascularization was achieved with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for VA and thrombectomy for BA occlusion. The neurological symptoms were improved in postoperative course.

This study aims to elucidate the difference in efficacy between SB and PB as pre-balloon in superficial femoral artery angioplasty. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed angiographic images of 113 lesions in 98 patients treated with endovascular surgery. 37 lesions were prepared by SB and 76 lesions by PB. Lesions without significant residual stenosis nor a flow-limiting dissection were treated by drug-coated balloon and the others by drug-eluting stent. Severity of dissection was evaluated by Kobayashi dissection grade and NHLBI classification. The rate of stent implantation was compared between the 2 groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate at 12 months. Results: Severe dissections (>1/3 of lumen) occurred less frequently in the SB group (SB 40.5% vs. PB 75.0%, P = 0.001). Overall stent implantation rate was lower in the SB group (SB 27.0% vs. PB 55.3%, P = 0.005). In subgroup analysis for the complex lesions, the SB group had lower rate of severe dissection(>1/3 of lumen) in patients with long lesions(>15 cm) (SB 51.7% vs. PB 76.9%, P = 0.020) and lesions of calcium grade >= 2 (SB 43.8% vs. PB 72.5%, P = 0.009). SB group had lower stent implantation rate in patients with long lesions (SB 34.5% vs. PB 59.6%, P = 0.030), lesions of calcium grade >= 2 (SB 31.3% vs. PB 56.9%, P = 0.023), and total occlusion (SB 30.8% vs. PB 80.0%, P = 0.002). There were no procedure-related complications in either group except 1 case of puncture-site hematoma. There was no significant difference in TLR rate between both groups at 12 months (P = 0.509). Conclusion: SB reduces the incidence of severe dissection (>1/3 of lumen) and rate of overall stent implantation in comparison with PB. The use of SB is a safe and effective method of lesion preparation in SFA angioplasty.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on all consecutive patients who underwent recanalization with stent implantation of CA or SMA between 2015 and 2019. Data regarding technical success (successful stent placement with restoration of sufficient blood flow by the first attempt without changing kind of introducer sheath or access site), indication for treatment, vascular access, kind of introducer sheath, fluoroscopy time and radiation dose were collected. Preinterventional CT were analyzed to classify the difficulty of catheterization of target vessels. Technical parameters were compared with independent t-test (p <= 0.05). Results: 66 patients underwent recanalization of CA or SMA. Usage of steerable introducer sheaths was associated with higher technical success compared to not steerable introducer sheaths with transfemoral approach respectively of 8/8 vs 15/19 for the CA and 11/11 vs 17/20 for the SMA. Steerable introducer sheaths were used in recanalization considered more technically difficult compared to not steerable introducer sheaths (58% vs 33%). Usage of steerable introducer sheath showed a statistically significant reduction of radiation dose in the recanalization of the SMA (respectively 32035 +/- 15716 cGy cm(2) vs 60102 +/- 28432 cGy cm(2); p = 0.005). Conclusion: Even if used in more difficult interventions, steerable introducer sheaths showed a higher technical success compared to not steerable introducer sheaths with transfemoral access.

Computed tomography revealed a 22 mm saccular aneurysm with a wide neck at the main renal artery trunk. An 8 x 100 mm Viabahn stent graft (W. L. Gore, Flagstaff, AZ) was deployed by fully pulling back the guiding sheath. However, the deployment knob was not able to be pulled. We returned the guiding sheath to the original position and confirmed the cause was the bowstring phenomenon. Because avoidance of this phenomenon required straightening of the tortuous vessel, the stent graft was deployed by short pull-back of the guiding sheath. Computed tomography after a year revealed no opacification of the aneurysm and the patency of the stent graft.

We describe a case of CAD presenting in a female with left external iliac artery occlusion and intermittent claudication, for whom an intra-operative diagnosis of CAD of the ilio-femoral segment was made. A 37-year-old mother-of-two was referred to a Vascular Surgeon with a 3 to 4-year history of progressive intermittent claudication. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram demonstrated a left external iliac artery occlusion. Given the location of the lesion, the absence of cardiovascular risk factors and the patient's history of cycling, a diagnosis of left external iliac artery occlusion secondary to arterial endofibrosis or spontaneous arterial dissection was thought to be likely. A left Rutherford-Morrison incision was made and an extraperitoneal approach used to expose the left iliac system. A cyst was opened and marsupialized along the superior aspect of the external iliac artery, releasing gelatinous material. A provisional intra-operative diagnosis of CAD was made. The patient was systemically heparinized and an external iliac to common femoral artery bypass was performed using reversed ipsilateral greater saphenous vein. CAD primarily involves the popliteal artery. Under 40 cases of CAD with iliofemoral involvement have been reported. Our case is unusual given the location of CAD, as well as its occurrence in a female. Management options for similar cases have been described in the literature ranging from cyst excision and arterial patching, to interposition bypass and even exclusion bypass, in the case of longer segment occlusions. In our case, an exclusion bypass was deemed the most appropriate treatment given the extensive length and complete occlusion of the external iliac artery.

Little is known about the natural history and optimal management of these aneurysms. We report a 58-year-old female patient with bilateral renal artery aneurysms with significant rapid growth of the right aneurysm on 1-year follow-up. Due to her age and the anatomical complexity of the aneurysm, the patient was not a candidate for endovascular repair. She therefore underwent open repair of the right renal artery aneurysm with resection and primary anastomosis. This case offers an example of surgical management of this rare disease process.

Methods A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted on data about all consecutive patients treated for visceral artery pseudoaneurysms in the Interventional Radiology Unit of SS Annunziata Hospital, in Taranto (Italy) between January 2016 and July 2020. Only patients treated with NBCA-MS embolization were included. Clinical and technical outcomes were evaluated during in-hospital stay and at 3-month follow-up by computed angiotomography (CTA). Results Among 89 patients undergoing treatment for visceral artery pseudoaneurysm, a total of 58 (65.2%) patients (n = 32, 55.2% men; median age 45.8 years, range: 35-81) treated with NBCA-MS only were enrolled. Pseudoaneurysms were located in the renal artery (n = 18 cases, 31%), in the splenic artery (n = 27, 46.6%), in the intra-parenchymal hepatic artery (n = 3, 5.2%), in the common hepatic artery (n = 4, 6.9%) or in the pancreatic artery (n = 6, 10.3%). N-butyl-cyanoacrylate was diluted 1:1 with Lipiodol ultra-fluid, and mean volume injected was 0.6 +/- 0.3 mL (range: 0.2-2.8 mL). Embolization was technically and clinically successful in all patients (n = 58, 100%) with an immediate total thrombosis of the pseudoaneurysm at the completion angiography. No systemic complications were noted in all cases. Five cases (8.6%) of non-target vessel embolization occurred without any clinical complication. No pseudoaneurysm recurrence was detected at the CTA control 1 day postoperatively. In one case (1.7%), a recurrence was detected 4 days after the initial treatment and successfully managed by a repeated NBCA-MS embolization. During the hospital stay, 56 patients recovered well but 2 (3.4%) died from multi-organ failure not related to the embolization. No recurrences were detected at the 3-month postoperative CTA in the remaining patients. Conclusions In properly selected patients affected with visceral artery pseudoaneurysms, NBCA-MS represents a definitive and safe embolization agent.

J	Pandey, G; Sharma, P				Pandey, Gargi; Sharma, Paritosh			The Management of Patients With Penetrating Aortic Ulcers: A Systematic Review	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Review						penetrating aortic ulcer; PAU; management; asymptomatic	DESCENDING THORACIC AORTA; STENT-GRAFT REPAIR; ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR; ATHEROSCLEROTIC ULCERS; NATURAL-HISTORY; INTRAMURAL HEMATOMA; FOLLOW-UP; OUTCOMES; INFLAMMATION; THERAPY	Background: Penetrating aortic ulcers (PAUs) are an entity within acute aortic syndrome. They often remain undiagnosed and are found incidentally or when they become symptomatic. Management is currently guided by clinical judgment. This review aims to identify indications for treatment and inform management. Methods: We searched PubMed for studies on the management of PAUs. The outcome measures were mortality, progression and resolution of symptoms. Results: This review incorporates 27 studies involving 1356 patients with PAU. Data was available regarding symptoms for 1213 patients (494 symptomatic, 719 asymptomatic). Overall late mortality for PAUs was found to be higher than 30-day mortality. Early mortality was higher for symptomatic patients as compared to those with asymptomatic PAUs. Early mortality was lowest for PAUs treated with endovascular interventions (5%), followed by PAUs managed medically and highest following open surgical management. Indications for treatment included symptoms, progression/instability, aortic diameter >5 cm, concomitant aortic pathology or pleural effusion. 13% of patients managed conservatively at initial presentation demonstrated progression and were considered for intervention subsequently. 9% of patients required reintervention after initial endovascular surgery. Conclusion: Endovascular treatment, if anatomically suitable, should be considered as first line treatment for symptomatic PAUs. Patients with asymptomatic PAUs, if associated with high-risk features such as PAU diameter >20 mm, PAU depth >10 mm, aortic diameter >42 mm, concomitant pathology, morphological change or an infective etiology, should also be considered for intervention. Small asymptomatic PAUs with no high-risk features may be managed conservatively but must undergo regular surveillance.

Cervical sympathectomy or distal sympathectomy or A botulinum toxin have demonstrated efficacy after medical treatment failure. We report the case of a 38-year-old female patient with an acute onset of severe RP in both hands secondary to systemic sclerosis. Medical treatment failed, so a novel approach by a combination of a modified distal sympathectomy and injection of A botulinum toxin on digital neuromuscular bundles was performed. Remission of the pain occurred immediately after the procedure and 45 days later she had complete healing of the digital wounds and recovered full mobilization of both hands. The patient remained asymptomatic 6 month after the procedure, and a Doppler ultrasound showed tri-phasic flows distal to the surgical site. This novel technique is described, and a brief review of the literature is performed.

The most common symptoms are hematemesis, epigastric pain or retrosternal chest pains, odynophagia, and dysphagia. Early recognition of IHE is important as it may mimic other diseases such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, Mallory-Weiss tears, Boerhaave's syndrome, ruptured aortic aneurysms, and aortic dissection. Computed tomography is the preferred investigation method, and treatment is usually conservative. We herein present 2 cases of IHE associated with catheter-directed thrombolysis in the setting of pulmonary embolism.

Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent interventions for lower extremity CTOs in the OBL setting by a single vascular surgeon were evaluated (January 2013-November 2017). If antegrade crossing was not possible, then a retrograde distal approach was used. Patient characteristics, CTO location, procedural time, contrast, anticoagulation and radiation doses and costs were recorded. Post-procedural complications were documented on post-procedure day 1 and 10-14 days post procedure. Three groups were compared: group 1-antegrade approach for femoropopliteal CTOs; group 2-antegrade approach for tibial CTOs, and; group 3-retrograde approach for femoropopliteal and tibial CTOs. Results: Two hundred and thirty-seven patients were studied. In 39 (16.5%), the lesions could not be crossed. A successful antegrade approach was used in 185 of them, of which 69% (group 1, n = 128) patients had femoropopliteal CTOs and 31% (group 2, n = 57) had tibial CTOs. Fourteen patients (5.9%, group 3) were treated by retrograde distal approach. Group 3 patients received higher contrast doses than groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.01). However, patients in groups 1 and 2 received similar contrast doses. Group 3 patients had the highest operative time and treatment costs followed by group 1 and then group 2 (p = 0.01). Three femoral pseudoaneurysms were noted in group 1, and 2 in group 2. No complications were seen in group 3. Conclusions: Although the operative times, costs, radiation and contrast dose are higher with retrograde arterial access, it represents a safe and effective method for the crossing of CTO infrainguinal lesions in an ambulatory venue.

In this case, the patient underwent repeated angioplasty of a prior vein bypass graft utilizing a paclitaxel-coated balloon. He subsequently developed a progressive aneurysmal degeneration, threatening his bypass, which ultimately required an urgent exclusion with a covered stent. This case represents a rare complication of peripheral bypass graft related to percutaneous intervention as well as paclitaxel-coated devices and warns other practitioners of the increased scrutiny and caution one should exercise in the use of such interventions.

The results of aneurysm excision with arteriovenous anastomosis proximalization for the treatment of dialysis fistula aneurysms have been described below. Methods: Patients qualified for the reconstruction of a dialysis fistula aneurysm underwent a duplex ultrasound examination. The diameter, length of the aneurysm, relations with the artery, thrombus presence and blood flow were determined. In the case of favorable anatomical conditions, we performed aneurysm excision with arteriovenous anastomosis proximalization as the procedure of choice. Patients, dialysis access, operative data and the results obtained during a median follow-up of 41 months were then analyzed. Findings: Since 2012, we have performed 20 aneurysm excision combined with primary anastomosis as dialysis fistula aneurysm treatment. In 18 patients, aneurysm excision was combined with simple re-anastomosis in the more proximal arterial segment. In 2 autogenous radio-cephalic forearm direct fistulas the aneurysm excision was combined with switching anastomosis type from side-to-end to end-to-end. The 12- and 24-month primary patency rates of corrected fistulas in the observed group were 94.7% and 82.4%, respectively. No early complications were noted. In 7 patients (35%) we observed late complications, which required reintervention or led to access failure. Dialysis fistula thrombosis as an indication for treatment was a significant risk factor for late re-occlusion. Discussion: A simple primary reconstruction by arteriovenous anastomosis proximalization and aneurysm excision for the surgical correction of dialysis fistula aneurysms has potential benefits compared to established methods-aneurysmorraphy and aneurysm excision with a vascular prosthesis bypass. The obtained data showed the efficiency, safety and excellent long-term results of this procedure.

Many listed causes can be attributed to the development of there are no reported cases of AHVF following a core-needle biopsy. We report a case of 38 year-old-female with EHPVO, who underwent splenectomy with a proximal splenorenal shunt. She had an injury to left hepatic artery, consequent to a blind intra-operative core needle biopsy from the liver, which led to the development of a fistulous connection between left hepatic artery and middle hepatic vein causing high output cardiac failure. She was successfully managed with trans-arterial embolization. The present review emphasizes the possibility of AHVF following a liver biopsy and the role of digital subtraction angiography in the diagnosis, therapeutic intravascular interventions, and follow-up.

Early detection and treatment of the pseudoaneurysms should be done as they carry high mortality following rupture. The splenic artery is the commonest artery involved followed by gastroduodenal and pancreaticoduodenal arteries. Gastric artery pseudoaneurysms are less common with less than 50 cases reported in the literature till now. We describe a case of gastric artery pseudoaneurysm secondary to chronic pancreatitis in a patient who presented with intermittent GI bleeding and also describe the role of endovascular management in the treatment of the same.

However, such risks are rarely reported and raising awareness can increase the safety of chiropractic manipulations. Case Report We present two middle-aged patients with carotid artery dissection leading to ischemic stroke after receiving chiropractic manipulation in Foshan, Guangdong Province, China. Both patients had new-onset pain in their necks after receiving chiropractic manipulations. Excess physical force during chiropractic manipulation may present a risk to patients. Patient was administered with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator after radiological diagnoses. They were prescribed 100 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 3 months as dual antiplatelet therapy. There were no complications over the follow-up period. Conclusion These cases suggest that dissection of the carotid artery can occur as the result of chiropractic manipulations. Patients should be diagnosed and treated early to achieve positive outcomes. The safety of chiropractic manipulations should be increased by raising awareness about the potential risks.

Materials and Methods A total of 229 patients (43.2% [n = 99] female and 56.8% [n = 130] male), who underwent hemodialysis through a TDC, were included in this study. Tip cultures of TDCs removed in an operating room and under sterile conditions were collected. All patients were asymptomatic for catheter infection and had not received antibiotic therapy for the last month. Results The median duration of catheterization was 80 days (min: 5, max: 2880). Bacterial growth was observed in a total of 62 (27.1%) patients. The most common microorganisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. The asymptomatic infection rate was highest in catheters placed through the right and left subclavian veins; however, this was not statistically significant due to the small number of patients. Placement and usage time of TDCs were found to be the most significant factors for bacterial growth in the catheter tip culture (P < .001). Conclusion Prolonged duration and use of the catheter is significant in terms of bacterial load. The use of TDC as vascular access in renal replacement therapy should be avoided as much as possible.

Repeated Endovascular Interventions Are Worthwhile, Even After Thrombosis, to Maintain Long-Term Use of Autogenous Dialysis Fistulas	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						autogenous fistula; endovascular intervention; fistula abandonment; hemodialysis; fistula patency	VASCULAR ACCESS; ARTERIOVENOUS-FISTULAS; PERCUTANEOUS INTERVENTIONS; HEMODIALYSIS; OUTCOMES; GRAFTS; MAINTENANCE; GUIDELINES; MORBIDITY; SURVIVAL	Objectives: Patients often require multiple access re-interventions to improve fistula patency and the overall usable lifespan of autogenous arteriovenous fistula (aAVF). There is no consensus on the appropriate number of re-interventions after which an access should be abandoned and new access placed. We evaluated whether repeated endovascular interventions for failing/failed aAVF are worthwhile or futile. Methods: A retrospective review was performed on aAVFs created between 2009-2014. Fistula function was evaluated until January 2017. Functional fistula patency (FFP) was defined as the total time of functional fistula use for hemodialysis, from time of cannulation to time of measurement or fistula abandonment, including all interventions performed to maintain/reestablish patency. Primary outcomes were FFP duration and number of post-dialysis interventions. Results: The study included 163 patients. Mean age was 67 (SD = 15.03). The only variable statistically different between functional fistulas and abandoned fistulas was obesity (p = 0.03). At the end of the study period, 145 (89.0%) patients continued to have functional fistulas, and 73 (44.8%) patients died, but had functional fistulas at time of death. Median FFP for the functional group was 3.18 years (range 0.01-7.01 years) and median number of interventions was 1 (range 0-13). In 18 patients (11%), the fistula was abandoned, most commonly due to thrombosis (47.1%), followed by infection (23.5%). No fistula was abandoned because of an unacceptable rate of reintervention. Median FFP in the abandoned group was 0.91 years (range 0.03-5.30 years), and median number of interventions was 0 (range of 0-5). Conclusions: Through repeated interventions on aAVFs, none of the patients in our study exhausted all hemodialysis access options prior to transplantation, death or loss to follow-up. These results may indicate repeated and/or more frequent revisions do not negatively affect the FFP nor do they increase the overall risk for abandonment of aAVFs.

J	James, JD; Agarwal, H; Kumar, V; Kumar, A; Hemachandran, N; Gupta, A				James, Joses Dany; Agarwal, Harshit; Kumar, Vignesh; Kumar, Atin; Hemachandran, Naren; Gupta, Amit			Traumatic Arterio-Enteric Fistula-A Report of 2 Cases With Review of Literature	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Review						arterio-enteric; fistula		Background: Traumatic arterio-enteric fistula is predominantly seen after penetrating trauma with only 21 reported cases documented in the past 25 years. They may present in an acute or delayed manner with upper or lower gastrointestinal bleed. A detailed clinical examination with requisite imaging can help in detecting such injuries. Case Description: Case 1: A 20-year-old gentleman, presented with penetrating stab injury to the gluteal region with bleeding per rectum. Imaging revealed evidence of injury to the inferior rectal artery which was found to be communicating with the extraperitoneal portion of the rectum. He was managed with a combination of endovascular and open surgery with a successful outcome. Case 2: A 29-year-old gentleman, presented in a delayed manner 2 weeks after a gunshot wound to the gluteal region, which was managed operatively in another hospital. He developed a massive lower gastrointestinal bleed 2 weeks after presentation. Imaging revealed evidence of a pseudoaneurysm of the inferior gluteal artery which had a fistulous communication with the gastrointestinal tract leading to bleeding. It was managed by endovascular techniques successfully. Conclusion: Arterio-enteric fistulas following trauma are rare phenomena and they need a high index of suspicion for diagnosis. Once diagnosed, they can be managed based on their location and patient physiology by interventional techniques, surgery, or a combination of the two.

Case Report: A 79-year-old male patient, was seen in the ambulatory clinic with a 2-year history of bilateral leg swelling, calf pain, chronic ulceration, and hyperpigmentation. Upon physical examination, lower extremities were edematous, with a 3 cm suppurative ulcer on each leg. Image studies showed a popliteal right arterial aneurysm of maximum diameter of 41.7 mm, extrinsically compressing the ipsilateral popliteal vein. Likewise, on the left leg, a popliteal arterial aneurysm of maximum diameter of 47.9 mm was encountered triggering the same phenomenon. Bilateral endovascular treatment deploying stent grafts was auspiciously performed. At 36-months follow up, his symptoms are completely resolved, and his ulcers healed. US follow up showed exclusion of the aneurysms with progressive shrinkage of both residual sacs. Conclusion: Popliteal artery aneurysm compressing and constraining flow in the popliteal vein must be included as a differential diagnosis among the causes of chronic venous syndromes. Prompt diagnosis with its appropriate treatment is needed for reducing severe complications caused by PAA, such as the venous disorder our patient had.

However, there have been few studies investigating the relationship between the EPA/AA ratio and atherosclerotic risk factors in patients with PAD. The purpose of the present study was to analyze atherosclerotic risk factors in patients with PAD to identify those factors associated with a low EPA/AA ratio. Methods. The data of patients treated for symptomatic PAD at Tokyo Medical University Hospital and Eniwa Midorino Clinic between April 2014 and March 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Results. A total of 149 patients were tested for blood levels of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, including EPA and AA. 73 patients had a low EPA/AA ratio (<0.4) and 76 patients had a high EPA/AA ratio (>= 0.4). Univariate analysis showed that older age (>= 75 years), female sex, smoking history, body mass index (BMI), and hemoglobin A(1C) (HbA(1C)) were associated with the low EPA/AA ratio. Multivariable analysis showed that older age (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95% confidential interval [CI], 0.15-0.76; p = 0.008), BMI (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.98; p = 0.027), smoking history (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.09-6.55; p = 0.007), and HbA(1C) (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29-0.72; p = 0.020) were independently associated with the low EPA/AA ratio. Conclusions. The EPA/AA ratio was related to existing arteriosclerotic risk factors in patients with PAD; it was positively correlated with older age, increasing BMI, and higher HbA(1C), whereas it was negatively correlated with smoking history. These results suggest that the EPA/AA ratio may be closely intertwined with other atherosclerotic risk factors and have an influence on cardiovascular health.

The management of aortic pathologies may be called into question in malpractice suits. Malpractice claims were analyzed to understand common reasons for litigation, medical specialties involved, patient injuries, and outcomes. Methods: Litigation cases in the Westlaw database from September 1st, 1987 to October 23 rd, 2019 were analyzed. Search terms included "aortic aneurysm" and "aortic dissection." Data on plaintiff, defendant, litigation claims, patient injuries, misdiagnoses, and case outcomes were collected and compared for aortic aneurysms, aortic dissections, and overall cases. Results: A total of 346 cases were identified, 196 involving aortic aneurysms and 150 aortic dissections. Physician defendants were emergency medicine (29%), cardiology (20%), internal medicine (14%), radiology (11%), cardiothoracic (10%) and vascular surgery (10%). Litigation claims included "failure to diagnose and treat" (61%), "delayed diagnosis and treatment" (21%), "post-operative complications after open repair" (10%) and "negligent post-operative care" (10%). Patients with aneurysms presented with abdominal (63%) and back pain (37%), while dissections presented with chest pain (78%), abdominal pain (15%), and shortness of breath (14%). Misdiagnoses included gastrointestinal (12%), other cardiovascular (9%), and musculoskeletal conditions (9%), but many were not specified (58%). Overall, 83% of cases were wrongful death suits. Injuries included loss of consortium (23%), emotional distress (19%), and bleeding (17%). In 53% of the cases, the jury ruled in favor of the defendant. 25% of cases ruled for the plaintiff. 22% of cases resulted in a settlement. The mean rewarded for each case was $1,644,590.66 (SD: $5,939,134.58; Range: $17,500-$68,035,462). Conclusion: For aortic pathologies, post-operative complications were not prominent among the reasons why suits were brought forth. This suggests improvements in education across all involved medical specialties may allow for improved diagnostic accuracy and efficient treatment, which could then translate to a decrease in associated litigation cases.

Methods: This study comprised all consecutive patients who underwent CAS for atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis from March 2014 to May 2018. A standardized dose of atropine (0.4 mg) was given prior to stent deployment. Changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and neurological status were monitored and recorded. Potential predictors of HI were tested in multivariate analysis using binary logistic regression model. Results: A total of 728 patients were enrolled. Two hundred twenty seven patients (31.2%) developed periprocedural HI. The presence of hypertension (OR, 2.037; 95% CI, 1.292-3.211; P = 0.0022), symptomatic carotid lesions (OR, 1.704; 95% CI, 1.057-2.747; P = 0.0287), right sided lesions (OR, 3.090; 95% CI, 1.934-4.935; P = 0.0001), hyperechoic/calcified plaques (OR, 2.195; 95% CI, 1.458-3.304; p P = 0.0002), and longer lesions (OR, 1.043; 95% CI, 1.012-1.076; P = 0.0072) were significant predictable factors for the occurrence of HI. On the other hand, smoking was significantly associated with a 48.1% decrease in risk of development of HI (OR, 0.519; 95% CI, 0.358-0.754; P = 0.0006). There were no statistically significant differences in periprocedural morbidity or mortality between patients with and without HI. Conclusion: HI occurs in a considerable percentage of patients undergoing CAS. Hypertension, right sided, symptomatic carotid lesions, calcified plaques, and longer lesions were shown to be independent risk factors for the development of periprocedural HI. Conversely, smoking demonstrated a protective effect. HI did not appear to predispose to periprocedural adverse events.

Celiac artery pseudoaneurysm in a background of chronic pancreatitis is a very rare event. Digital Subtraction Angiography is an important adjunct in the diagnosis and follow-up with the advantage of providing therapeutic options along with giving other details regarding the site, size, and flow characteristics. It has replaced emergency surgical procedures with the added advantage of fewer postoperative complications and lower morbidity and mortality. An urgent surgical intervention remains the only option when such endovascular management fails, not feasible, or is unavailable. Surgical options include proximal arterial ligation or a pancreatic resection, depending on the location of the pseudoaneurysm. We report a case of a 35-year-old gentleman, a known patient of chronic pancreatitis, who presented to our emergency with clinical features of hypovolemic shock and was diagnosed to have celiac artery pseudoaneurysm. Following a failed endovascular coiling, he was successfully managed with operative celiac artery ligation.

Angio-MSCT showed highly calcified superficial femoral artery, with a 180 degrees bend in distal portion, followed by a large popliteal aneurism (63 x 61 mm) with a large extent hematoma (142 x 112 x 104 mm). Endovascular approach was chosen due to high morbidity. Results: Anterior puncture of right superficial femoral artery was performed under ultrasound guidance. Despite various intents, the 0.035 hydrophilic coated wire could not be crossed distally through the aneurism. Retrograde access was performed via tibio-peroneal trunk under fluoroscopic guidance with a micropuncture set. A stiff 0.035 '' Glidewire (R) was successfully advanced into the proximal portion of the aneurism through a 5F vertebral catheter externalized with a snare from the femoral sheath obtaining a "through-and-through wire" technique. Tightening of both ends of the wire helped gain support and straightened curves. Two stent grafts were implanted with no residual leak at 1 month follow-up. Conclusion: Anterograde and retrograde approach was useful to perform a through-and-through wire technique in a challenging case of a tortuous ruptured popliteal artery aneurism.

Methods: We performed a population-based retrospective analysis based on electronic medical record system data provided by Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University from 2009 to 2018. Results: We identified 1,367 cases of TBAD patients with TEVAR over the past decade. The total incidence of in-hospital complications was 7.6% (104 of 1,367), among which acute kidney injury (AKI) had the highest incidence (3.1%, 42 of 1,367). Aortic-related reintervention was performed in 7 patients (0.5%). The overall aortic-related in-hospital mortality rate was 2.7% (37 of 1,367) and had no significant time-varying trend (P = 0.2). Among these, 27% of in-hospital deaths were caused by retrograde type A dissection (RTAD). Chronic TBAD had a higher risk of in-hospital death versus acute TBAD, with a risk ratio of 2.69 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-6.09). Patients with hypertension (risk ratio 4.63, 95% CI: 1.38, 15.54) also had a higher in-hospital death risk. These 2 factors were also the predictive factors for the composite endpoint of in-hospital adverse events (risk ratio 2.17, 95% CI: 1.43, 3.29 and risk ratio 4.83, 95% CI: 1.90, 12.28, respectively), in addition to Marfan syndrome (risk ratio 4.05, 95% CI: 1.61, 10.19). The average length of hospitalization significantly declined during the past decade (annual percentage change -6.3%, 95% CI -8.2 to -4.3), and the stent-grafts (SGs) cost was the main expenditure of the total hospitalization costs. Conclusion: Our study showed a favorable early outcome of TEVAR over the past decade. Greater attention should be paid to certain risk factors in order to reduce the in-hospital adverse events.

Treatment of Post-Evar Aortoduodenal Fistula Without Endograft Excision	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						aortoduodenal fistula; abdominal aortic aneurysm; endovascular aneurysm repair	ABDOMINAL AORTIC-ANEURYSM; ENDOVASCULAR STENT-GRAFT; REPAIR; SECONDARY; MANAGEMENT	An 80 year-old gentleman presented with aortoduodenal fistula 2 months after uncomplicated endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Upon laparotomy and fistula takedown, there was no active hemorrhage from the excluded aneurysm. It was theorized the fistula had originated from an occult type II endoleak which had since thrombosed. The duodenum was repaired primarily; the anterior defect in the aneurysm sac was packed and covered with omentum. The patient recovered uneventfully and remains well after 9 months. This is the first case, to our knowledge, of a post-EVAR aortoduodenal fistula successfully treated without endograft excision.

Methods From March 2012 to October 2018, 51 consecutive CoA patients were treated with ascending aorta to bilateral iliac artery bypass concomitant with and cardiac surgerical procedures performed for a variety of reasons. A Y-shaped graft was used for the bypass procedure. We evaluated early outcomes, including postoperative death, systolic blood pressure and differences between upper and lower limb blood pressure. Results The average age was 41 years and 64.7% of patients were men. Simultaneous cardiac procedures included aortic valve replacement, ventricular septal defect repair, Bentall procedures and Wheat procedures. No deaths occurred in the early postoperative period. Three patients had delayed healing at the site of the abdominal lower quadrant incisions. The average systolic pressure in the upper limb and the average difference between the upper- and lower-limb blood pressure decreased significantly after surgery (162.7 +/- 13.4 mmHg vs 128.4 +/- 6.7 mmHg, P = .000; 69.6 +/- 15.6 mmHg vs 8.7 +/- 7.6 mmHg, P = .000, respectively); The systolic blood pressure in the lower limb increased after bypass surgery (93.1 +/- 6.2 mmHg vs 119.6 +/- 7.7 mmHg, P = .000). The follow-up rate was 100%, with an average follow-up time of 61 months. Six patients (11.8%) had graft stenosis or occlusion. Three patients (5.9%) underwent endovascular embolectomy. Conclusions In our small series, ascending aortoiliac bypass for one-stage repair of CoA with concomitant cardiac lesions appears safe and efficacious in effectively reduceing differences between upper and lower limb systolic blood pressure. Further study with larger sample size and longer follow-up is needed.

Schuyler			Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Diabetes Mellitus Undergoing Peripheral Vascular Intervention for Infrainguinal Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						lower extremity intervention; endovascular intervention; peripheral artery disease; diabetes mellitus; chronic limb threatening ischemia		Purpose: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are known to be at higher risk for peripheral artery disease (PAD), amputations, and major adverse cardiovascular events, though it is unclear whether they are at any higher risk for repeat intervention. LIBERTY 360 offered an opportunity to study a real-world cohort of patients who underwent distal superficial femoral artery endovascular revascularizations. We aimed to describe patients with DM, their outcomes following peripheral vascular intervention, and the effect of DM on outcomes in the LIBERTY 360 cohort. Methods: LIBERTY 360 is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, mono-industry funded observational study of patients undergoing endovascular revascularization. Outcomes included 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality, major amputation, target vessel/lesion revascularization, and a composite of those events. A multivariable regression model including DM was constructed to examine the effect of DM on outcomes. Multivariable survival estimates were made using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: A total of 1,204 patients were enrolled, of whom 727 had DM (60.4%). Patients with DM had significantly more comorbidities and a third required insulin for DM management. Patients with DM had more severe disease based on Rutherford classification at baseline. After adjusting for comorbidities and disease severity, DM patients had more frequent major amputations at 1 year (5.2% versus 1.2%; HR 2.71, 95%CI 1.05-6.98, p = 0.040). The 1-year rates of all-cause mortality and target vessel/lesion revascularization were not significantly higher for patients with DM. Conclusions: Diabetes mellitus was associated with increased major amputations at 1 year following endovascular revascularization after accounting for demographics, comorbidities, and PAD-related characteristics. Further research is needed to determine which aspects of PAD and DM are most strongly associated with poor outcomes following lower extremity revascularization.	[Weissler, E.

Previous publications have described back table modifications of standard iliac endografts to conform to the innominate artery for exclusion of the lesion. Others have proposed extra-anatomic bypass or carotid-subclavian transposition with occlusion of the innominate artery. We were unable to find a report of repair when aneurysms of the innominate and subclavian arteries were in continuity. We present such a case of endovascular repair using commercially available endografts without compromise of the left common carotid artery origin as this patient had a "bovine" arch. Surgeons will benefit from adding this endovascular option to their "tool box" when confronted with such a challenging clinical scenario.

Acute Thrombosis of an Infrarenal Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Presenting as Bilateral Critical Lower Limb Ischemia	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						thrombosis; abdominal aortic aneurysm; acute limb ischemia; open repair	SUDDEN COMPLETE THROMBOSIS	Background: Intraluminal thrombosis in the aneurysm sac is commonly seen in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Complete acute thrombosis of an AAA is a rare and catastrophic event. Method: We report a patient with acute AAA thrombosis presenting as bilateral lower limbs critical ischemia. A79-year-old male with a past history of AAA presented with acute onset of bilateral leg pain, coolness, weakness and numbness. His lower extremity pulses including femorals were absent bilaterally on physical examination. Urgent computed tomography angiography showed an infrarenal AAA measuring 45 mm in diameter. The aneurysm sac and bilateral common iliac arteries were completely occluded. Emergency open repair of AAA and bilateral iliac thrombectomy were successfully performed under general anesthesia. Result: Bilateral femoral pulses were present and the neurological deficits were completely resolved after operation. Patient recovered well and was asymptomatic at 3-month follow-up. Conclusion: Acute thrombosis of aortic aneurysm could be an unusual cause of lower limb ischemia, prompt diagnosis followed by surgical revascularization is essential to avoid prolonged ischemia.

Particularly, a case of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm is extremely rare and there are only 3 reported cases. A 70-year-old man underwent endovascular aortic repair for impending rupture of an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm and was medicated steroids for approximately 2 years. Four years after endovascular aortic repair, he developed endograft infection with an aortoduodenal fistula and a left psoas abscess. He underwent total endograft excision, debridement, in situ reconstruction of the aorta using prosthetic grafts with omental coverage, and digestive tract reconstruction to prevent leakage.Pseudomonas aeruginosawas detected in the infected aortic sac. The patient has not experienced recurrence of infection in the 35 months since his operation.

Patients and Methods This prospective study comprised all non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients presenting for endovascular management of CLTI. All endovascular interventions were done using CO2 as a contrast medium whether alone or supplemented by ICM (hybrid angiography) to treat unilateral arterial steno-occlusive lesions of iliac, femoropopliteal, or BTK arteries. Study outcomes included feasibility of the device, technical success, and freedom from contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI), renal replacement therapy, and CO2 angiography-related complications. Results A total of 206 CKD patients underwent endovascular intervention using CO2 only as a contrast medium (159 patients, 77.2%), or hybrid CO2-ICM angiography (47 patients, 22.8%). The overall technical success was 95.6%. Patients were followed up for a mean period of 17.9 +/- 4.6 months. The mean volumes of CO2, and ICM consumption were 200.7 +/- 95.1 mL, and 11.8 +/- 4.4 mL, respectively. The mean procedural, and fluoroscopy times were 95.6 +/- 12.5 and 49.5 +/- 10.8 minutes, respectively. BTK lesions were significantly associated with the need for hybrid angiography (P = <.0001). The mean pre- and postoperative serum creatinine levels were comparable (P = .08). Two patients (4.3%) showed transient manifestations of CI-AKI, but neither required renal replacement therapy. No statistically significant differences were encountered between the two study groups regarding procedure outcomes. Conclusion Hybrid CO2-ICM angiography is safe, feasible, effective, and a fairly simple alternative during endovascular interventions to treat chronic lower extremity ischemia. Using supplemental small volumes of ICM to overcome the suboptimal images generated by CO2 alone does not jeopardize the renal functions in CKD patients.

Methods Using the National Inpatient Sample database, we identified octogenarians (>= 80 years) and non-octogenarians (<80 years) who had undergone thoracic endovascular aortic repair between 2012 and 2017. We compared patients' demographic, socioeconomic, comorbidity data between the two groups as well as the procedure indications and perioperative outcomes. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of advanced age (>= 80 years) on the in-hospital mortality rates in patients who underwent TEVAR. This analysis was also performed for a separate cohort which included only patients who underwent TEVAR for ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm. Results A total of 4108 patients were included in our study; 3432 (83.5%) patients were <80 years (37.9% female; median age, 64 years; 34.3% non-white) and 676 (16.5%) patients were >= 80 years (50.7% female; median age, 83 years; 20.4% non-white). Non-ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm was the most common indication for TEVAR in older patients (61.4%), whereas type B aortic dissection was the most common indication in younger patients (36.4%). In-hospital complications were comparable between the two groups except for respiratory complications that were higher in the younger patients (21.2% vs. 15.2%; P <.001). The multivariable analysis demonstrated that advanced age had no association with increased in-hospital mortality rates (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], .97-2.05), However, in ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm cohort, octogenarians had higher in-hospital mortality rates (aOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.04-3.32). Conclusions Octogenarians have acceptable rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality compared to the younger group and should be considered for TEVAR. Octogenarians are at higher risk for in-hospital mortality in the setting of ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm, supporting the appropriateness of elective TEVAR in selected Octogenarians.

Outcomes After Selective Fasciotomy for Revascularization of Nontraumatic Acute Lower Limb Ischemia	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						acute limb ischemia; amputation; fasciotomy		Objectives: Limited data support the use of fasciotomies in acute limb ischemia (ALI) in patients with isolated arterial occlusion. This study describes an experience in which fasciotomies are not regularly performed post-revascularization. Methods: Using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Edition codes, patients presenting to the University of California Davis Medical Center between January 2003 and July 2018 with ALI, excluding those with traumatic injuries were identified. The primary outcome was major amputation, and the secondary outcome was foot drop. Additionally, the characteristics of those patients in each category of ischemic severity excluding those with grade 3 ischemia were summarized. Results: Of the 253 patients identified, revascularization was successful in 230 patients with 11 total fasciotomies performed. One hundred thirty-five patients were Rutherford Class 1/2A and 95 were 2B. In those with 1/2A ischemia, 134 (102 had >6 hours of symptoms) did not undergo fasciotomy with only one amputation occurring in this group. In those with 2B ischemia, 65 had >6 hours of symptoms; 58 did not undergo fasciotomy with 4 major amputations. In the 30 patients with <= 6 hours of ischemic symptoms, 27 did not undergo fasciotomy with 1 major amputation occurring in this group. There were no amputations in those patients who underwent fasciotomies. Additionally, there were 14 patients with a foot drop, of which 11 were in patients with 2B ischemia without fasciotomy. Conclusions: The data suggest that regardless of ischemic duration, 1/2A patients may not need fasciotomies, while those patients with 2B ischemia may benefit.

It uses a polyethylene glycol sealant plug which is absorbed fully within 30 days, alleviating concerns around difficulties with regaining access in future. The Mynx device uses a balloon, inflated within the artery and retracted against the arteriotomy to achieve haemostasis, with the extravascular sealant plug then deployed outside the vessel wall. While the manufacturer's instructions for use do not include utilisation of imaging guidance, we routinely employ fluoroscopic and/or ultrasound to ensure safe use of the device. These techniques allow confirmation of balloon position against the arteriotomy, hence avoiding inadvertent deployment of the plug partially or fully intraluminally. Visualisation of the balloon within the lumen also eliminates risk of plaque disruption in diseased vessels on retraction of the device. Image guidance adds little time to device deployment, and the safety benefits are such that we recommend that practitioners elsewhere consider adopting our techniques. Here, we describe the process involved in both techniques.

Materials and Methods: The PubMed Database was extensively searched for articles describing Portal Vein Stenosis (PVS) as a complication in Liver Transplant (LT) patients. The initial database search yielded 488 unique records published in the PubMed Database, 19 of which were deemed to meet the inclusion criteria. Outcomes were separated into 2 groups (Group A included patients with primary angioplasty, Group B included patients with primary stent placement), and further subdivided into Adult and Pediatric populations. Results: Group A included a total of 282 LT patients with portal vein stenosis. The population was predominantly pediatric (n = 243). Group B included a total of 111 LT patients with portal vein stenosis. This population was predominantly adult (n = 66). Technical success was significantly higher in both Group B pediatric (100%) and adults (97%) compared to Group A (69.5%) and (66.7%) respectively. Re-stenosis rates were significantly lower in Group B pediatric group compared to Group A (2.3% vs 29.7%, chi(2) = 13.9; p < 0.001). Overall major (3.1%) and minor complications rates (1.5%) were low. Conclusion: Primary stent placement appears to have higher technical success in both populations and lower re-stenosis rates for treatment of PVS in pediatric populations.

The present study was performed to evaluate the safety of embolization for VAPAs, including the incidence of intraprocedural rupture. Methods: Among 56 consecutive patients with 57 VAPAs who underwent treatment between April 2009 and October 2020, 46 patients with 47 VAPAs underwent embolization. Complications related to embolization including intraprocedural rupture, the technical success rate, and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Complications that required extended hospitalization, an advanced level of care, or resulted in permanent adverse sequelae or death were classified as major complications, while the remainder were considered to be minor. Technical success was defined as the completion of embolization. Results: The intraprocedural rupture of pseudoaneurysms occurred in 3 out of 47 VAPAs treated with embolization (6%) and resulted in minor complications. One liver abscess requiring drainage was regarded as a major complication (2%). Focal infarction after embolization was observed as a minor complication in 20 cases. Complications occurred in 24 out of 47 cases (51%), comprising one major complication (2%) and 23 minor complications (48%). The technical success rate was 100% (47/47). Fifty-three out of 56 patients (95%) were alive in a median follow-up period of 18 months (range: 2 days-137 months). Conclusions: Embolization is safe and useful for the treatment of VAPAs; however, the intraprocedural rupture of pseudoaneurysms may occur, and, thus, care is needed during this procedure.

Mycotic Pulmonary Aneurysm Managed With Covered Stent	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						mycotic pulmonary aneurysm; acute myeloid leukemia; bacteriemia; hemoptysis; endovascular technique; covered stent		Mycotic aneurysms are vascular dilations caused by fungal or bacterial infections. The involvement of the pulmonary artery or its branches is extremely rare with only a few cases reported in the literature posing a diagnostic challenge. We present the case of a young adult patient with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing chemotherapy, who presented with febrile neutropenia, recurrent bacteremia due to Pseudomona Aeruginosa and Klebsiella Pneumonie and hemoptysis. The management was unconventional, opting for the placement of a covered endovascular stent, being the first successful case with this reported technique. Rapid detection of this pathology and individualization in the management of each patient is essential because of high risk of mortality due to sepsis and rupture of the aneurysm.

Method: A single-center consecutive case series where 434 elective and acute P-EVAR procedures were registered prospectively between May 2011 and July 2017. The mean age was 74.5 years +/- SD 11.4 years. 82.3% of the patients were male. All patients were pre-planned from CT angiography. Percutaneous access punctures, performed in local anesthesia in the common femoral artery, with a final introducer size between 12-22 Fr OD were included and stratified in 2 groups, 12-16 Fr and 17-22 Fr. Results: By screening 868 access groins 22 groins were excluded. Of the remaining 846 groins, intended to be treated with ProGlide, 9 groins were excluded peri-procedurally and treated with the Fascia Suture Technique or surgical cutdown. The remaining 837 groins had access closure with ProGlide, with a mean value of 2.15 devices per groin with a slight significant difference between the 2 stratification groups. Primary ProGlide technical success was achieved in 68.1% of the groins. Secondary percutaneous or non-invasive technical success was achieved in 96.9%. Here there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 stratification groups. Thirty-one (3.7%) groin complications were registered during 30-day follow-up and 17 required additional treatment. Total mortality was 2.8%. None of these deaths were related to the access site. Conclusion: ProGlide by itself has a significant failure rate in the closure of large-bore access holes on an unselected cohort of patients eligible for P-EVAR. However, together with adjunct percutaneous or non-invasive methods a success rate of 97% can be achieved. The access complication rate was lower than 4% at 30-day follow-up.

Of the many complications that arise from ATAAD is malperfusion, which is the result of true lumen compression secondary to the dissection, and it is one of the most dangerous complications. Left untreated, malperfusion can eventually compromise circulation to the vascular beds of almost all vital organs. Clinicians must consider the diagnosis of malperfusion promptly following a diagnosis of acute aortic dissection. The outcomes post-surgery for patients with ATAAD with concomitant malperfusion remains poor, despite mortality for aortic surgery improving over time. Optimal management for ATAAD with associated malperfusion has yet to be implemented, further research is warranted to improve the detection and management of this potentially fatal pathology. In this review, we explore the literature surrounding the complications of malperfusion in ATAAD and the various symptom presentations, investigations, and management strategies available.

Management of an Aortoenteric Fistula in a Patient with End Stage Renal and Liver Disease, Prior Endovascular Aortic Repair With Type II Endoleak	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						aortoenteric fistula; EVAR; endoleak; ESRD		Primary aortoenteric fistula (AEF) is an uncommon but life-threatening condition. We present a case of primary AEF in an octogenarian with previous endovascular aortic repair, type II endoleak and end stage liver and renal disease. He was successfully treated with accessory renal artery ligation, duodenojejunostomy, aneurysm sac debridement and irrigation and closure of the aneurysm sac over a drain. The patient made an excellent recovery and was discharged on POD #7, with no complications noted after over a year of follow up. This approach may represent a valuable option to manage primary AEF versus open endograft explant, particularly in severely ill patients.

FET is frequently used to treat aortic conditions involving the distal aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta in a single stage. Surgical preference has recently changed from FET procedures being performed at Zone 3 to Zone 2. There are several advantages of Zone 2 FET over Zone 3 FET including reduction in spinal cord injury, visceral ischemia, neurological and cardiovascular sequelae. In addition, Zone 2 FET is a technically less complicated procedure. Literature on the comparison between Zone 3 and Zone 2 FET is scarce and primarily observational and anecdotal. Therefore, further research is warranted in this paradigm to substantiate current surgical treatment options for complex aortic pathologies. In this review, we explore literature surrounding FET and the reasons for the shift in surgical preference from Zone 3 to Zone 2.

Endovascular interventions on infrageniculate vessels are frequently performed with the intent of treating peripheral artery disease (PAD) and decreasing the risk of amputation in those with diabetes. This study aimed to investigate how the extent of MAC impacts outcomes of endovascular procedures in people with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Methods: We identified all patients who had undergone infrageniculate angioplasty in the setting of DFU at our institution between 2009 and 2019. Subjects were assigned a MAC score based on the severity of MAC in each vessel visualized on plain radiographs of the ankle and foot. We evaluated the relationship between MAC and the primary outcome, major adverse limb event (MALE), using stratified Cox proportional modeling. Results: Among 99 subjects with DFU who had undergone infrageniculate angioplasty, MALE occurred in 50% (95% confidence interval [CI] 38%-61%) of patients within 1 year of intervention. On univariate Cox regression analysis, each 1 point increment in MAC score (hazard ratio [HR], 1.09; 95% CI 1.01-1.18), the third tertile of MAC score (HR, 2.27; 95% CI 1.01-5.11), age (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.93-0.99), and wound grade (HR, 5.34; 95% CI 2.17-13.14), were significantly associated with increased risk of MALE. On adjusted analysis stratified by wound grade, MAC score was found to be associated with MALE only in patients with a low wound grade. Conclusion: Increased severity of MAC is associated with increased risk of MALE for subjects undergoing infrageniculate angioplasty with a low wound grade. Further research is needed to better understand the complex relationships of MAC, PAD, DFU, and interventions aimed at promoting healing of DFU.

Comparison of Clinical Outcomes in Patients Selected for Infra-Popliteal Bypass or Plain Balloon Angioplasty for Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia Between 2009 and 2013	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						chronic limb threatening ischemia; endovascular; bypass surgery; infrapopliteal; tibial	RISK	Introduction: A published subgroup analysis of the Bypass versus Angioplasty in Severe Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL)-1 trial suggests that, in patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) due to infra-popliteal (IP) disease, clinical outcomes are better following vein bypass surgery (BS) than after plain balloon angioplasty (PBA). The aim of the present study is to determine if clinical outcomes following IP revascularization in our unit are concordant with those found in BASIL-1. Methods: We analyzed prospectively gathered data pertaining to 137 consecutive CLTI patients undergoing IP PBA or BS between 2009 and 2013. We compared 30-day morbidity and mortality, days in hospital (index admission and out to 12-months), amputation free survival (AFS), overall survival (OS), limb salvage (LS), and freedom from arterial re-intervention (FFR). Patient outcomes were censored on 1 February 2017, providing a minimum 3 years follow-up. Results: Patients undergoing BS (73/137, 47%) tended to be younger, have less comorbidity, and were more likely to be on best medical therapy (BMT). BS patients spent more days in hospital during the index admission (median 9 vs 5, p = .003), but not out to 12 months (median 15 vs 13, NS). BS patients suffered more 30-day morbidity (36% vs 10%, p < .001), mainly due to infective complications, but not mortality (3.1% vs 6.8%, NS). AFS (p = .001) and OS (p < .001), but not LS or FFR, were better after BS. Conclusions: CLTI patients selected for revascularization by means of IP BS had better long-term outcomes in terms of AFS and OS, but not FFR or LS. Although we await the results of the BASIL-2 trial, current data support the BASIL-1 sub-group analysis which suggests that patients requiring revascularization for IP disease should have BS where possible and that PBA should usually be reserved for patients who are not suitable for BS.

Edward, Jr.			Evaluation of Staged TCAR and Cardiac Surgery or Structural Heart Intervention	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						TCAR; carotid disease; coronary disease; cardiac valve disease		Introduction: The optimal treatment strategy for patients with concomitant carotid and cardiac disease remains controversial. Transcarotid artery revascularization stenting with reversed flow protection (TCAR) has achieved results equivalent to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in high risk patients. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients at a single center who received staged TCAR prior to cardiac intervention was performed. Results: 37 patients underwent 42 TCAR procedures prior to cardiac intervention (25 requiring open cardiac surgery and 12 requiring percutaneous intervention). There were no myocardial or neurological complications following TCAR prior to cardiac intervention. Three patients (8%) developed a neck hematoma which required evacuation. Conclusion: A staged approach to combined carotid and cardiac pathology with TCAR prior to cardiac intervention appears to be a safe and effective strategy.	[Almenoff, Maxwell; Garrett, H.

Stent-associated thrombocytopenia is a rare complication not typically seen with modern stents. The following case describes the clinical presentation of stent kinking and consumptive coagulopathy. Stent-associated microangiopathic hemolytic anemia was inferred from protracted workup and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Despite the risk of arterial puncture in the setting of profound thrombocytopenia, the patient was successfully treated with stent embolization with near immediate rebound in platelet count. This case report documents the presentation of rare stent-associated thrombocytopenia leading to challenging diagnostic evaluation and necessitating high-risk intervention.

Favorable Conservative Management of a Rare Primary Aortitis Secondary to Listeria Monocytogenes: Case Report and Review of the Literature	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Review						primary aortitis; listeria monocytogenes; conservative management		Primary aortitis (PA) secondary to Listeria monocytogenes is extremely rare with only a few cases reported in the literature. Presently, there is no consensus concerning the best treatment when no complications are found in the thoracic computed tomography (CT) imaging. This report illustrates the clinical presentation and favorable clinical course of a rare case of PA secondary to Listeria monocytogenes in an 82-year-old diabetic woman, successfully treated with conservative management with 18 months of follow up. Included in this article, we additionally present a review of the literature of this uncommon etiology of infectious aortitis.

Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common perioperative cardiac arrhythmia. It is speculated that elevated suPAR has a role in the development of AF. The aim of our study was to investigate the predictive role of preoperative suPAR in the occurrence of AF during the first 6 months after major vascular surgery. Methods: We included 119 male and 63 female patients with an average age of 67.19 +/- 6.02 years, without permanent/persistent AF. Basic predictive model (BASIC) included traditional risk factors for AF: age, gender, body mass index-BMI, smoking status, presence of arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. Results: Over the 6-month period, 19 (10.4%) patients had one new episode of atrial fibrillation and 2 patients (1.1%) had 2 episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Paroxysms of AF were significantly more frequent in patients who had a resection of an abdominal aneurysm than in patients with other types of major vascular surgery. BASIC had good discriminatory ability in the prediction of AF paroxysms during the first 6 months after surgery (AUC = 0.715, 95%CI 0.590-0.840). Adding suPAR to the basic model significantly improved the discriminative ability of the predictive model for AF episodes (Delta AUC = 0.238, p < 0.001). The predictive performance of the model BASIC+CRP+suPAR, measured using AUC, NRI and IDI statistics, was very similar to the model BASIC+suPAR. Conclusion: AF is a common complication in surgical patients with high mortality and morbidity. suPAR could improve the ability of traditional risk factors to predict its occurrence up to 6 months after major vascular surgery.

Aneurysm thrombus density after EVAR could predict successful aneurysm exclusion. Materials and Methods: Twenty-seven patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) who had a CT scan within the first 45 days (early group) post-surgery or after 7 months (late group) were included. Thrombus density was analyzed on non-contrast enhanced CT scans. Results: A total of 5/13 (38%) patients in the early group had an ELII and 9/14 (64.3%) in the late group had a persistent ELII since surgery. In the early group, thrombus density was similar in patients with or without an ELII (mean: 39.9 +/- 4.8 vs. 41.9 +/- 3.4, p = 0.7; median: 38.7 +/- 4.8 vs. 39.7 +/- 3.1, p = 0.8). In patients with an ELII, there was no difference in thrombus density at 45 days and after 7 months (mean: 39.9 +/- 4.8 vs. 40.2 +/- 2.1, p = 0.9; median: 38.7 +/- 4.8 vs. 38 +/- 2.6, p = 0.9). In patients without an ELII, thrombus density was significantly higher at 45 days than after 7 months (mean: 41.9 +/- 3.44 vs. 25.7 +/- 2.0, p = 0.005; median: 39.7 +/- 3.11 vs. 24.4 +/- 1.5, p = 0.004). In patients with an ELII, thrombus density was significantly higher after 7 months than in patients without an ELII (mean: 40.2 +/- 2.1 vs. 25.7 +/- 2.0. p = 0.001; median: 38 +/- 2.6 vs. 24.4 +/- 1.5, p = 0.003). Conclusion: Low thrombus density after EVAR on late unenhanced CT scans predicts aneurysm exclusion.

Carotid Restenosis Following Endarterectomy in Patients Managed With Single Antiplatelet Therapy Versus Dual Antiplatelet Therapy	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						carotid endarterectomy; athererosclerosis; restenosis; antiplatelet; single antiplatelet therapy; dual antiplatelet therapy		Background: Antiplatelet therapy is a cornerstone in the management of carotid artery disease following carotid endarterectomy (CEA). There is a paucity of data regarding the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) on restenosis rates. Methods: A retrospective review of patients who underwent CEA from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2013 was performed at a single center. Study groups consisted of subjects who received DAPT and those who received single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) following CEA. Restenosis was evaluated by carotid duplex. Severity and timing of restenosis, postoperative complications, and reinterventions were compared between study groups. Results: Between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2013, 1453 patients underwent CEA. The SAPT group consisted of 245 patients and the DAPT group consisted of 1208 patients. No difference in restenosis was identified between groups at less than 6 weeks (6.5% vs. 11.7% 50-79% stenosis, 0% vs. 2.2% 80-99% stenosis, 2.2% vs. 0.6% occlusion, p = 0.368), and 6 weeks to 2 years (20.6% vs. 17.9% 50-79% stenosis, 1.1% vs. 1.0% 80-99% stenosis, 1.6% vs. 0.4% occlusion, p = 0.242). A higher rate of restenosis in SAPT was found greater than 2 years from surgery (68.4% vs. 82.4% <50% stenosis, 29.9% vs. 16.1% 50-79% stenosis, 0% vs. 0.6% 80-99% stenosis, 1.7% vs. 0.9% occlusion p = 0.004). This finding persisted on multivariable analysis with 31.6% of the SAPT group showing >50% stenosis vs. 17.6% of the DAPT group (adjusted OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.30-0.76, p = 0.002). In a propensity matched-population, 32.7% of the SAPT group demonstrated restenosis vs. 13.7% of the DAPT group (adjusted OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.16-0.77, p = 0.009). There was no difference in the need for reintervention between study groups (DAPT 3.8% vs SAPT 3.3%, p = 0.684). Conclusion: Following CEA, patients on DAPT exhibited lower rates of late restenosis.

However, there will be some gutter space around 2 stent grafts, which may cause endoleak. The "eye of the tiger" technique was invented to minimize this leak when deploying a small side-branch stent graft in conjunction with a large aortic endograft. The purpose of this case report is to describe our modified technique for 2 small endografts deployed in double D-shape in order to prevent gutter leak, which we applied in endovascular treatment for a hypogastric artery aneurysm. Case Report: A 79-year-old male patient presented with a right hypogastric artery aneurysm measuring 44 mm. The patient refused the open surgical repair option and hoped for an endovascular treatment. Therefore, endovascular treatment to exclude the hypogastric artery aneurysm as well as preserve the gluteal arteries was planned. An Internal Iliac Component (IIC)(W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was utilized for the proximal sealing and 2 Viabahn stent grafts (W. L. Gore & Associates) were deployed in the superior and inferior gluteal arteries for distal sealing. Then, 2 VBX stent grafts (W. L. Gore & Associates) were added in the IIC as bridging stents to connect the IIC and both Viabahn stent grafts. Next, over-dilatation of VBX stent grafts was performed alternately with an 8 mm balloon catheter and subsequent kissing balloon dilation with 5 mm balloon catheters, which allowed the VBX stents to be set in double D-shape. A follow-up CT scan performed 1 week after the procedure revealed no endoleak and a favorable shape to the VBX stent grafts. Conclusion: The modified method of dilating the VBX stent grafts allowed the double D-shape deployment, minimizing the risk of gutter leak and preserving distal branch perfusion.

Data regarding the optimal anticoagulation regimen for VTE prevention and treatment remain scarce. This study describes the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with VTE treated in a single academic center in Mexico. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of all patients with a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized in a single academic center in Monterrey, Mexico, between March 2020 and February 2021, with a radiologically confirmed VTE, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Informed consent was obtained from each patient before reviewing their medical records. Results Of the 2000 COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 36 (1.8%) developed VTE and were included in the analysis. The median age was 60 years (range 32-88 years), and up to 78% (n = 28) were males. Most patients (n = 34, 94%) had an underlying comorbidity and 47% (n = 17) had a BMI >= 30 kg/m2. In most cases (n=28, 78%), VTE presented as a PE, whereas the remaining 22% (n = 8) had a DVT. The median time between hospital admission and VTE was 8 days (range 0-33 days). Regarding the thromboprophylaxis regimen, 35/36 patients received low molecular weight heparin enoxaparin on admission, most commonly at a dose of 60 mg daily (n = 19, 53%). Other complications presented were superinfection (n = 19, 53%), acute kidney injury (n = 11, 31%), and septic shock (n = 5, 14%). A total of 69% of patients (n = 25) required intensive care unit admission, and patients' overall mortality was 55.6%. Conclusion VTE remains a significant cause of increased morbidity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. The strikingly high mortality among patients with VTE highlights the need for further investigation regarding the best preventive, diagnostic, and treatment approaches.

Completion Arteriogram Following Carotid Endarterectomy Yields Lower Perioperative Stroke Rate	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						carotid endarterectomy; completion arteriogram; technical defect; stroke	STUMP PRESSURE; ANGIOGRAPHY; OUTCOMES; IMPACT; DEATH	Introduction: Completion imaging following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) remains controversial. We present our experience performing routine completion arteriography (CA). Methods: A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained institutional database was performed for patients undergoing isolated CEA. Results: 1439 isolated CEAs with CA were performed on 1297 patients. CEA was for asymptomatic lesions in 70% (1003) of cases. There were no complications related to arteriography. An abnormal arteriogram documented significant abnormalities in the internal carotid artery (ICA) and prompted revision in 1.7% (24/1439) of cases: 20 unsatisfactory distal endpoints of the endarterectomy (12 residual stenoses, 7 intimal flaps, and 1 dissection), 3 kinks or stenoses within the body of the patch, and 1 thrombus. Of the 20 distal endpoint lesions, stent deployment was used in 17 cases and patch revision in 3 cases. The other 4 cases were treated by patch angioplasty (3) or thrombectomy (1). None suffered a perioperative stroke. The overall 30-day stroke, death, and combined stroke/death rate for the 1439 patients in our series was 1.5% (22), .5% (7), and 1.9% (27), respectively. The combined stroke/death rate for asymptomatic lesions was 1.1% (11/1003) and for symptomatic lesions was 2.5% (11/436). Of the 22 strokes in the entire series (all with normal CA), 15 were non-hemorrhagic strokes ipsilateral to the CEA; 14 were confirmed to have widely patent endarterectomy sites by CT-A (13) or re-exploration and repeat arteriography (1). The occluded site was re-explored and underwent thrombectomy, but no technical problems were identified. The remaining strokes were hemorrhagic (4 reperfusion syndrome and 1 surgical site bleeding) or contralateral to the CEA (2). Conclusion: Although not all patients in this series who underwent intraoperative revision due to abnormal CA might have suffered a stroke, performing this simple and safe study may have halved our overall perioperative stroke rate from 3.2% to 1.5%.

Superior Mesenteric Artery and Vein Injuries: Operative Strategies and Outcomes	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Review						superior mesentery artery; superior mesentery vein; visceral vessel injury; vascular trauma	NONCOMPRESSIBLE TORSO HEMORRHAGE; BLUNT ABDOMINAL-TRAUMA; DAMAGE CONTROL; MANAGEMENT; REPAIR; TIME; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MULTICENTER; MORTALITY; SPECTRUM	Traumatic injuries to the mesenteric vessels are rare and often lethal. Visceral vessels, such as the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and vein (SMV), supply blood to the small and large bowel by a rich system of collaterals. Because fewer than 100 such injuries have been described in the literature, they pose challenges in both diagnosis and management and can unfortunately result in high mortality rates.

Report: In this report we describe a patient with a previous endoluminal repair of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm, complicated by a persistent type 1a endoleak despite treatment with endoanchor fixation. A decision was made to proceed with a proximal 4 vessel FEVAR to treat the type 1a endoleak. Due to angulation of the mesenteric vessels, and a rotation of the fenestrated stent graft during deployment, the CT and SMA were unable to be catheterized. A decision was made to perform a median laparotomy for retrograde access of the aforementioned vessels, allowing successful catheterization and stenting. The patient was discharged 30 days following the procedure, without any major post-operative complications. Follow up at 6 weeks with a contrasted enhanced computerized tomography scan showed a stable repair with no residual type 1a endoleak. Discussion: Catheterization of the target vessels during a FEVAR can be difficult, especially in patients with challenging anatomy. Prolonged surgical time in an attempt to catheterize the vessels can result in increased morbidity for the patient, and ultimately may result in the procedure being abandoned or conversion to an open repair of the aneurysm. Retrograde access of the target vessels as a bailout measure during fenestrated stent graft repair due to failure of an antegrade approach has rarely been reported in the literature. Only a few cases are described in the available literature, however, none of them describe retrograde approach of both the CT and SMA as described in this case. A median laparotomy for retrograde access is a feasible alternative in these situations, and should be considered if the patient is suitable.

Autologous vein is regarded superior to other options. As the graft of first choice, the great saphenous vein (GSV) is often not available due to previous bypass, stripping or poor quality. Other options like arm veins (AV) are important alternatives. As forearm portions of AVs are often unusable, a graft created from the upper arm basilic and cephalic veins provides a valuable alternative. Patients and Methods: We analyzed consecutive patients treated at an academic tertiary referral center between 01/1998 and 07/2018 using arm veins as the main peripheral bypass graft. Study endpoints were primary patency, secondary patency, limb salvage and survival. Results: In the observed time period 2702 bypass procedures were performed at our institution for below-knee arterial reconstructions. Vein grafts used included the ipsilateral GSV (iGSV; n = 1937/71.7%), contralateral GSV (cGSV; 192/7.1%), small saphenous vein (SSV; 133/4.9%), prosthetic conduits (61/2.3%) and different configurations of AV (379/14%). In the majority of patients receiving AV grafts a complete continuous cephalic or basilic vein (CAV) was used (n = 292/77%). If it was not possible to use major parts of these 2 veins, either spliced arm vein grafts (SAV) (42/11%) or an upper arm basilic-cephalic loop graft (45/12%) were used. Median follow-up was 27 (interquartile range: 8-50) months. After 3 years secondary patency (CAV: 85%; SAV: 62%; loop: 66%; p = 0.125) and limb salvage rates (CAV: 79%, SAV: 68%; loop: 79%; p = 0.346) were similar between the 3 bypass options. Conclusion: The encouraging results of alternative AV configurations highlight their value in case the basilic or cephalic veins are not useable in continuity. Especially for infragenual redo-bypass procedures, these techniques should be considered to offer patients durable revascularization options.

Methods: In this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected information in patients undergoing CEA, we recorded information on demographics, risk factors and comorbidities, dissection maneuvers of the distal ICA, other operative variables and neurological outcome measures. Results: During the period July 2008 and February 2020 inclusive, 218 consecutive patients (180 males, median age 69.5 years) underwent 240 CEAs. In 117 (48.8%) of them, CEA was performed for a symptomatic stenosis. Dissection maneuvers of the distal ICA were required in 77 cases (32.1%), including division and ligation of the sternocleidomastoid vessels in 66 cases (27.5%), mobilization of the XII cranial nerve in 69 cases (28.7%, with concomitant transection of the superior root of the ansa cervicalis in 11 cases, 4.6%) and division of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle in 8 cases (3.3%). Styloid osteotomy was not required in any case. Smoking was the single predictive factor associated with the use of an adjunctive dissection maneuver (odds ratio 2.23, p = 0.009). The use of a patch was more common in smokers (16% vs 7.1% in non-smokers, odds ratio 2.48, p = 0.05). Perioperative stroke and/or death rate was 0%, not allowing testing for associations with maneuver performance. Two patients (0.8%) developed a transient ischemic attack and 4 patients (1.7%) a cranial nerve injury (CNI), including 2 patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, diagnosed on routine laryngoscopy during planning of a contralateral CEA. There was no association between CNI and dissection of the distal ICA using an operative adjunct (p = 0.60). Conclusions: Several surgical maneuvers are often required to accomplish dissection of the distal ICA beyond the point of atherosclerotic disease. When dictated by operative findings, such maneuvers are deemed safe.

Here, we report a case of spontaneous rupture of the ascending lumbar vein for the first time. A 66-year-old woman visited the emergency department due to the swelling of the left lower limb for 2 hours. After admission, the patient developed symptoms of pain in the left lumbar region, as well as symptoms of shock, such as increased heart rate and decreased blood pressure. During emergency venography, it was found that the ascending lumbar vein was ruptured, which was accompanied by the compression and occlusion of the iliac vein (May-Thurner syndrome). During the endovascular surgical treatment, a covered stent was placed in the iliac vein, and the occluded common iliac vein was treated with a bare stent. Immediately after the surgical procedure, the patient's abdominal computed tomography examination showed the formation of a large retroperitoneal haematoma, and continuous routine blood parameter monitoring showed that haemoglobin was stable. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the ninth postoperative day.

We propose that non-ventilated patients who develop COVID-19 related spontaneous arterial thrombosis with associated limb threat may be best suited with percutnaeous revascularization to achieve limb salvage. Herein we describe 5 cases of patients who had severely threatened limbs with complete thrombosis of all 3 tibial arteries who were treated with percutaneous revascularization. All 5 patients were felt to be facing inevitable amputation without revascularization should they survive their COVID hospitalization. We were able to achieve limb salvage in all 5 patients selected for therapy, although 2 ultimately succumbed to respiratory failure.

However, effectiveness of DB for patients with intermittent claudication (IC) remains uncertain. This study aimed to analyze long-term results of DB for IC patients (IC-DB) compared with those of DB for CLI patients (CLI-DB). Methods: Patients undergoing DB from January 2009 to July 2018 at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Operative details, primary and secondary patency, amputation free survival rate (AFS), and long-term exercise capacity using Barthel index were analyzed. Results: Out of 302 DB (245 patients), 49 IC-DB were performed in 43 patients: 38 males, mean age 70.3 +/- 8.0 years, diabetes mellitus 51%, chronic renal failure with hemodialysis 7%. The Great saphenous vein was used in 47 limbs, the small saphenous vein in 1, and the arm vein in 1. These grafts were bypassed in a non-reversed fashion for 35 limbs, in an in-situ fashion in 9, and in a reversed fashion in 5. The mean operative time was 173 min. The mean follow-up was 25 +/- 26 months. Primary and secondary patency of IC-DB was 79% and 94% at 1 year, 71% and 90% at 3 years, 65% and 90% at 5 years, which were significantly higher than those of CLI-DB (primary patency: P = .007, secondary patency: P = .025). AFS of IC-DB and CLI-DB was 100% and 77% at 1 year, 93% and 52% at 3 years, and 90% and 43% at 5 years (IC-DB vs. CLI-DB, p < .0001). Barthel index of IC-DB unchanged at discharge (median 100) and at the last visit (median 100), showing daily activity was maintained adequately. Conclusions: DB could offer a promising approach for patients with IC because of durable graft patency, acceptable AFS, and maintenance of daily activity.

Temporal Analysis of Tachycardia During Catheter Directed Thrombolysis for Acute Pulmonary Embolism	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						pulmonary embolism; thrombolysis; tachycardia; catheter-directed thrombolysis; heart rate	TRIAL; FIBRINOLYSIS	Purpose: To evaluate the effect of catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT) on heart rate (HR) in patients with sinus tachycardia and acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed for patients who underwent CDT with tPA for acute massive or submassive PE between 12/2009 and 2/2020. Included were patients who presented with tachycardia at the time of initiation of CDT. Patients with chronic PE, atrial fibrillation, beta blocker therapy, adjunctive endovascular therapy, systemic thrombolysis, or who expired before conclusion of CDT were excluded. HR was measured approximately every hour during CDT. Graphs were plotted of HR as a function of CDT duration. Two interventional radiologists identified the point of plateau (POP) on the graph where CDT had maximized its benefit in decreasing the patient's HR. Discrepancies were adjudicated by a third interventional radiologist and the median of the 3 measurements was selected. The primary endpoint was the duration of CDT from initiation until the POP. Results: 48 patients were included (52.5 +/- 14.7 years, 56.3% female). The POP occurred after 13.1 +/- 6.1 hours, by which point HR had been reduced from 110 +/- 9.2 bpm to 88 +/- 10.6 bpm. Sinus tachycardia was not resolved in 10 patients even though they achieved maximal improvement in HR after 11.3 +/- 6.7 hours. Conclusion: Patients presenting with sinus tachycardia related to acute PE achieved maximal, sustained reduction in heart rate from CDT, after approximately 13 hours of infusion. Patients who did not resolve their tachycardia by that point in time were unlikely to resolve it by the conclusion of CDT.

Management of Pancreaticoduodenal Artery Aneurysms Based on a Single-Institution Experience	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm; endovascular surgery; visceral artery aneurysm		Objectives: Pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms (PDAAs) are rare and have a high propensity for rupture. Historically, management of PDAAs included surgical reconstruction but has evolved with advances in endovascular therapy. We report our experience with management of PDAAs during the last 30 years. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our prospectively maintained registry between January 1, 1992 - March 30, 2020. Results: We identified 8 patients with PDAAs: 4 with associated celiac artery occlusive disease and 4 without identifiable etiologies. Four patients were treated with surgical resection of the PDAAs: 2 intact aneurysms underwent concomitant revascularization (superior mesenteric artery-to-hepatic artery Dacron bypass; supra celiac aorta-to-hepatic artery Dacron bypass) and 2 (1 intact, 1 rupture) underwent ligation alone. Four patients were treated with coil embolization of the PDAA: 2 with concomitant stent-graft exclusion of the aneurysm (1 non-rupture, 1 rupture) and 2 without adjunctive measures (intact). There were no deaths nor any significant procedure-related morbidity. Conclusion: Our large single-center experience shows that PDAAs can be successfully treated by open or endovascular intervention with selective revascularization.

We reported the case of a 67-year-old female who presented with painless progressive jaundice for 2 months accompanied by thrombocytopenia and liver dysfunction. The computed tomographic angiography (CTA) showed an aberrant SAA located behind the pancreatic head along with the dilation of common bile duct. Stent-graft deployment in SMA and coil embolization of the aneurysm were performed. Her liver dysfunction and thrombocytopenia improved postoperatively. CTA at 2-year follow-up showed patency of stent-graft and SMA and the shrinkage of the excluded aneurysm sac. Considering the particular location of the aneurysm, painless progressive jaundice can be the initial symptom for the aberrant SAAs. This combined endovascular technique completely excluded the aneurysm and was beneficial for treating secondary liver dysfunction and thrombocytopenia.

Method: We report a patient with a large superficial femoral artery aneurysm presenting with irreversible limb ischemia, due to multiple distal embolization as demonstrated with urgent computed tomography angiography. Due to local and systemic consequences primary limb amputation was performed. Unfortunately, the patient died from cardiac arrest on the 2nd postoperative day. Conclusion: Delayed diagnosis of true superficial femoral artery aneurysms can result in life-threatening consequences. Peripheral embolization is an uncommon event, but can lead to irreversible ischemia and limb loss.

Methods: Retrospective analysis was performed on all non-ruptured AAA treated by elective EVAR using FDA-approved endografts in our facility from July 2004 to December 2017. Patients were grouped into 3 cohorts based on preoperative aneurysm size: Group I (<5.5 cm), Group II (5.5-6.4 cm), and Group III (>= 6.5 cm). Occurrences of endoleak, secondary intervention and overall survival underwent univariate and multivariate analysis. Cause of death data on deceased patients was similarly examined. Results: A total of 517 patients were analyzed. There was no difference between size groups in the rate of endoleak (Group I 48/277, 17.3%; Group II 33/160, 20.6%; Group III 18/80, 22.5%; p = 0.46) or time until endoleak development. Univariate analysis showed no difference in the rate of secondary intervention (Group I 36/277, 13.0%; Group II 24/160, 15.0%; Group III 18/80, 22.5%; p = 0.11), time until intervention or number of interventions performed. Multivariate analysis showed an association with shorter time to secondary intervention for both Group III aneurysms (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.11-3.73; p = 0.02) and female patients (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.02-3.13; p = 0.04). There was no difference in overall survival, aneurysm-related mortality or overall cause of mortality. Conclusion: AAA diameter prior to EVAR was not associated with any differences in rates of endoleak or secondary intervention, and was not associated with poorer overall survival or greater aneurysm-related mortality. Patients with suitable anatomy for EVAR can be considered for this intervention without concern for increased complications or poorer outcomes related to large aneurysm diameter alone.

Case Report: A 72-year-old male patient presented at a medical center with abdominal pain and reduced liver function according to laboratory tests. Due to a history of right hemihepatectomy and left portal vein occlusion, the percutaneous transhepatic approach was considered inappropriate. Instead, percutaneous transsplenic access was selected as a suitable procedure for portal vein catheterization. Eight days following the procedure, the patient developed abdominal pain, and a computed tomography scan showed a small splenic pseudoaneurysm that was underappreciated at the time. Patient suffered acute splenic rupture 32 days post-procedure. Subsequent embolization was performed, achieving complete hemostasis. Conclusion: The transsplenic approach should be considered when the transhepatic or transjugular approach is unfeasible or difficult to implement. A careful plugging of the puncture tract is necessary to prevent or minimize hemorrhage from the splenic access tract. In addition, careful serial follow-up computed tomography should be used to evaluate the splenic puncture tract.

Research has shown that it is a safe and effective form of treatment, however, one of the well-known risks is in-stent thrombosis. We hypothesize that a single 75 mg dose of Clopidogrel the night prior to the procedures along with a 3-month regimen post-op would decrease the 30-day thrombosis rate. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 3,518 patients from September 2012 to August 2018 who received an iliofemoral stent. Patients were broken down into 2 main groups: those given Clopidogrel post-stent and those given Clopidogrel both pre- and post-stent. In our practice, we prescribe a 3-month course of Clopidogrel after iliac vein stenting. Patients were also checked for any anticoagulant medications pre- and/or post-stent. The 30-day thrombosis rates were recorded for each patient. Results: 1,205 patients received Clopidogrel pre-procedurally and post-procedurally, 1,941 patients received Clopidogrel only post-procedurally. 372 patients were excluded from the study because they were on other anti-coagulant medications. Mean follow-up for this cohort was 17 months. 112 total patients developed some degree of 30 day in-stent thrombosis (3.6%). 74 patients developed a complete thrombosis of the stent and 38 developed a partial (<= 60% occlusion) thrombosis. Of the 1,205 patients who were on clopidogrel pre-stenting, 28 had a complete thrombosis and 10 had a partial in-stent thrombosis. Of the 1,941 patients on Clopidogrel only post-stenting, 46 had a complete thrombosis and 28 had a partial in-stent thrombosis. Using the Chi-squared test, there were no statistically significant differences between the group of patients receiving Clopidogrel pre- and post-stent vs. just post-stent with respect to 30-day any degree of thrombosis rates (complete and partial thrombosis) (p = .33). Using the Chi-squared test, there were no statistically significant differences between the group of patients receiving Clopidogrel pre- and post-stent vs. just post-stent with respect to 30-day complete thrombosis rates (p = .93). Conclusions: There appears to be no statistical difference in 30-day thrombosis rates between those receiving Clopidogrel the night prior vs. those who do not receive Clopidogrel the night prior. Therefore, we conclude that it is not necessary to give this single dose the night prior to iliac vein stenting procedures.

Up to a third of CLTI patients are not eligible to receive first-line treatments such as bypass surgery or endovascular interventions. Epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used as a method to improve microcirculatory blood flow and relieve ischemic pain in CTLI patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate limb salvage, ulcer closure, and clinical changes of SCS implanted CTLI patients at 1-year follow-up. Methods: Eligible patients had end-stage lower limb PAD unresponsive to medical therapy and not amenable to surgical reconstruction. Patients were candidates for amputation, but limb loss was not inevitable (Fontaine stage III and IV). Pain intensity and skin temperature in the ischemic area (visual analogue scale), quality of life (WHOQoL-BREF), and ankle/brachial blood pressure index (ABI) were recorded at routine follow-up visits. Data were analyzed retrospectively. Results: 29 patients underwent SCS implantation at one vascular center. The minimum follow-up period was 30 months. Limb survival at 1-year follow-up was 97% (28/29) and 73% (11/15) had complete closure of limb ulcers. Pain intensity, skin temperature, and quality of life progressively improved up to 12 months after implant, with Fontaine stage III patients improving more substantially than Fontaine stage IV patients. SCS therapy did not affect ABI measurement. No complications related to the device or procedure occurred. Conclusions: SCS is a valid alternative in patients unsuitable for revascularization. The quality of results depends on both a strict selection of patients by vascular specialists and the frequency of follow-up controls. The therapy may be more beneficial in patients classified as Fontaine stage III.

Monckeberg medial sclerosis is considered to be more widespread in the lower abdominal region and lower limbs. We present a 59-years-old male patient presented right foot gangrene. At physical exploration, femoral and popliteal pulses were presented and the ankle-brachial pressure index was 0.45, and the toe-brachial index was 0.33. The patient underwent distal angioplasty of anterior and posterior tibial arteries and due to inaccurate evolution a transmetatarsal amputation was required. Monckeberg's medial sclerosis is diagnosed with an ABI>1.1, however, questions have been raised about the validity and the role of ABI in diagnosis of Monckeberg's medial sclerosis. Colour-doppler vascular ultrasound allow a non-invasive technique widely available to detect vascular calcification and to differentiation between Monckeberg's medial sclerosis and the atherosclerosis-related lesions.

Multi-Level Lower Extremity Arterial Revascularization Via Retrograde Pedal Access Under Local Anesthesia in a Patient With Severe Cardiopulmonary Comorbidities: A Case Report	VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY			English	Article						retrograde pedal access; critical limb ischemia; comorbidities; local anesthesia; supine	VESSEL	Background: Chronic limb-threatening ischemia is a severe form of peripheral artery disease that leads to high rates of amputation and mortality if left untreated. Bypass surgery and antegrade endovascular revascularization through femoral artery access from either side are accepted as conventional treatment modalities for critical limb ischemia. The retrograde pedal access revascularization is an alternative treatment modality useful in specific clinical scenarios; however, these indications have not been well described in literature. This case report highlights the use of retrograde pedal access approach as primary treatment modality in a patient with an extensive comorbidities precluding general anesthesia nor supine positioning. Case Presentation: The patient is a 60-year-old female with multiple severe cardiopulmonary comorbidities presenting with dry gangrene of the right great toe. Her comorbidities and inability to tolerate supine positioning precluded her from receiving open surgery, general anesthesia or monitored sedation, or percutaneous femoral access. Rather, the patient underwent ankle block and retrograde endovascular revascularization via dorsalis pedis artery access without post-operative complications. Discussion: The prevalence of comorbidities related to peripheral artery disease is increasing and with it the number of patients who are not optimal candidates for conventional treatment methods for critical limb ischemia. The retrograde pedal access revascularization as initial treatment modality offers these patients an alternative limb salvaging treatment option.

Its etiology include defective suture techniques and infections. The clinical presentation includes allograft dysfunction, local mass effect, exsanguination, and rupture. Open surgical repair is associated with significant morbidity and allograft dysfunction. Endovascular stent-graft can be a less invasive, alternative approach. We describe a case of large pseudoaneurysm arising from the internal iliac artery in a post-renal transplant patient. It was successfully treated with the stent-graft. The externally compressed right common iliac vein was also treated with a self-expanding non-graft stent. Thus, endovascular approach can be an effective alternative to open repair for post-renal transplant iliac artery pseudoaneurysm.

This study aimed to determine if more recent(2015-2018) endovascular outcomes data have improved relative to surgical bypass. Methods: Patients who underwent intervention for chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) from 2015-2018 were identified using the American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program(NSQIP) Vascular Surgery module. The cohort was categorized as undergoing lower extremity bypass(LEB) or infrainguinal endovascular intervention(IEI). Primary 30-day outcomes included major adverse cardiac events(MACE), major adverse limb events(MALE), and major amputation. Inverse probability weighting was used for multivariable analysis. Results: A total of 10,783 patients underwent an infrainguinal intervention for CLTI from 2015-2018. Of these, 6,003(55.7%) underwent LEB and 4,780(44.3%) underwent IEI. Forty percent of the cohort was considered "high anatomic risk" by Objective Performance Goals(OPG) standards, and 13.6% were considered "high clinical risk." The IEI cohort vs. the LEB cohort experienced a Myocardial infarction(MI)/Stroke rate of 1.8% vs. 3.6%(p < .001), and had a mortality rate of 2.0% vs. 1.7%(p = .22), which yielded a composite MACE of 3.4% vs. 4.8%(p = .001). The rate of reintervention for IEI vs LEB was 4.4% vs. 5.3%(p = .04), the loss of patency (without re-intervention) rate was 1.8% vs. 1.8%(p = 1.0), and the major amputation rate was 4.1% vs. 3.5%(p = .15), which resulted in a MALE rate of 9.1% vs. 8.8%(p = .50). Following inverse probability weighting, comparing the IEI to the referent LEB, MALE AOR = 1.17, 95% CI[1.01 -1.36], p = .036, MACE AOR = 0.61, 95% CI[0.49-0.74], p < .001, and major amputation AOR = 1.31, 95% CI[1.05 -1.62], p = .016. Conclusion: Endovascular outcomes continue to demonstrate inferiority in major amputation and overall MALE. However, endovascular intervention has a significantly reduced incidence of MACE. Overall, these results demonstrate an improvement in endovascular MACE rates in recent years relative to surgical bypass.

A high index of suspicion is required for early diagnosis and treatment, decreasing the morbidity and mortality rate of this severe complication. We report a case of a 4-year-old boy presenting severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to a carotid-esophageal fistula, secondary to deployment of an esophageal metallic prosthesis for treatment of a recurrent stenosis. The carotid pseudo-aneurism was successfully treated with stents and coils. Although endovascular treatment is a safe and effective option, arterial stenting in children needs further studies with long-term follow-up.

Over the past 8 weeks, patient began having intermittent back and abdominal pain that worsened and became persistent over the past few days. This was accompanied by anorexia and non-bilious vomiting. Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) demonstrated a wide neck large celiac artery aneurysm (60 mm diameter). Endovascular repair of the aneurysm was performed using stent graft of the aorta and transcatheter coil embolization of the aneurysm sac. Technical success was confirmed by interruption of flow in the aneurysm, and preservation of distal native circulation at the conclusion of the procedure. One-week post-embolization, a CTA demonstrated complete thrombosis of the aneurysm. On follow-up CTA at 3, 6, and 12 months after embolization, the aneurysm has completely thrombosed and decreased in size to 24 mm. Patient remains asymptomatic till date.

It was previously shown that endovascular therapy for CLI was not meeting these benchmarks. The OPG for all peripheral interventions is <8% for major adverse cardiac events (MACE), <8% for major adverse limb events (MALE), and <3% for major amputation. The goal of this study is to evaluate if outcomes have improved for CLI in recent years, specifically 2015-2018. Methods: The Targeted Vascular Module from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) was queried to identify patients who underwent endovascular intervention for critical limb ischemia from 2011-2018. Cohorts were divided into 2011-2014 and 2015-2018. Primary 30-day outcomes were MACE, MALE, and major amputation. Univariate analyses were performed using the Fisher's exact test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Multivariate analysis comparing groups was performed using inverse probability weights and trend over time analysis was performed using logistic regression with year of intervention as a continuous variable. Results: From 2011 to 2018, 7,168 patients underwent an endovascular intervention for CLI. 28% were classified as "OPG high anatomic risk," and 17% were classified as "OPG high clinical risk." The 2015-2018 cohort vs. the 2011-14 cohort experienced MACE in 3.3% vs. 2.7% (p = .23), MALE in 9.1% vs. 8.9% (p = 0.83), and amputation in 4.0% vs. 4.2% (p = 0.71). When only high anatomic risk patients were considered (n = 1988), MACE was experienced in 2.4% vs. 2.2% (p = 0.87), MALE by 9.5% vs. 10.6% (p = 0.47) and amputation by 5.1% vs. 6.0% (p = 0.40). When only high clinical risk patients were considered (n = 1224), MACE was experienced in 5.2% vs. 3.9% (p = 0.33), MALE by 8.0% vs. 7.4% (p = 0.74) and amputation by 3.9% vs. 3.7% (p = 0.88). Comparing 2015-2018 to the reference 2011-2014, MALE adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.99, 95% CI [0.83-1.18], MACE AOR = 1.19 95% CI [0.88-1.60], and major amputation AOR = 0.91 95% CI [0.70-1.17]. There were no decreases in the trend over time for MALE (AOR per year 0.97, CI [.94-1.02], major amputation (AOR per year: 0.97, CI [0.91-1.03], nor for MACE (AOR per year: 1.05, CI [.98-1.13]). Conclusion: Outcomes following endovascular interventions for CLI continue to underperform when compared to OPG benchmarks for MALE and amputations. There is no decrease over time for these target outcomes. Target MACE events remain acceptable despite the increasing clinical complexity of patients being treated.

Prior reports discuss incidents of isolated renal artery dissections and isolated splanchnic artery dissections; however, these types of dissections almost never occur simultaneously. Based on literature review, only one other case report has described spontaneous dissections of multiple visceral arteries. This brief report presents the successful endovascular treatment of a previously healthy man with spontaneous dissection of the proximal celiac artery and bilateral renal arteries. Due to the patient's acute presentation and renal injury, stenting of bilateral renal arteries was undertaken with successful medical outcomes on postprocedural follow up.
