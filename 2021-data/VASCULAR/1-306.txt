Neurogenic TOS (nTOS), which is thought to be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus, accounts for more than 90% of the cases. Although treatment for nTOS is successful through physiotherapy and/or surgical decompression, little is known about the impact of psychosocial factors, namely, major depressive disorder (MDD), on postoperative outcomes such as non-routine discharge (NRD). Here, we assess whether MDD predicts the type of discharge following nTOS surgical intervention. Methods A retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample database from the years 2005-2018 was performed. Using the International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification, Ninth and Tenth revisions, patients who underwent a surgical intervention for nTOS were identified. Our primary outcome was to investigate the effects of MDD on nTOS patient disposition status after surgical management; secondary outcomes included analysis of total hospital charges and length of stay. NRD was defined as anything beyond discharge home without healthcare services. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess MDD and other potential independent predictors of NRD and prolonged hospital stay (> 2 days) following surgical intervention. Results A total of 6099 patients were identified: 596 (9.77%) patients with MDD and 5503 (90.23%) without MDD. On average, patients with MDD were older (39.6 +/- 12.0 years vs. 36.0 +/- 13.0 years; p < 0.001), female (80.7% vs. 63.5%; p < 0.001), white (89.6% vs. 85.6%; p = 0.030), and on Medicare (9.6% vs 5.2%; p < 0.001). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models identified MDD as an independent risk factor associated with a higher risk of NRD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.2). Additionally, chronic kidney disease (aOR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.2-5.4), postoperative complications (aOR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.2-2.9), and Medicare (aOR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.9-4.7) were statistically significant predictors for higher risk of NRD. However, MDD was not associated with prolonged hospital stay (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.8-1.2) or higher median of total charges (MDD group: $27,867 vs. non-MDD group: $28,123; p = 0.799). Conclusion Comorbid MDD was strongly associated with higher NRD rates following nTOS surgical intervention. MDD had no significant impact on length of hospital stay or total hospital charges. Additional prospective research is necessary in order to better evaluate the impact of MDD in patients with nTOS.

J	Gurkan, S; Gur, O; Sahin, A; Donbaloglu, M				Gurkan, Selami; Gur, Ozcan; Sahin, Ayhan; Donbaloglu, Mehmet			The impact of obesity on perioperative and postoperative outcomes after elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Abdominal aortic aneurysm; obesity; endovascular aneurysm repair; morbidity	BODY-MASS INDEX; RISK-FACTOR; ENDOLEAK	Background Obesity is a common and growing health problem in vascular surgery patients, as it is in all patient groups. Evidence regarding body mass index (BMI) on endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) outcomes is not clear in the literature. We aimed to determine the impact of obesity on perioperative and midterm outcomes of elective EVAR between obese and non-obese patients. Methods Under a retrospective study design, a total of 120 patients (109 males, 11 females, mean age: 74.45 +/- 8.59 (53-92 years)) undergoing elective EVAR between June 2012 and May 2020 were reviewed. Patients were stratified into two groups: obese (defined as a body mass index (BMI) >= 30 kg/m(2)) and non-obese (mean BMI < 30 kg/m(2) (32.25 +/- 1.07 kg/m(2) vs 25.85 +/- 2.69 kg/m(2))). Results Of the 120 patients included in the study, 81 (67.5%) were defined as "nonobese," while 39 (32.5%) were obese. The mean BMI of the study group was 27.93 +/- 3.78 kg/m(2). In obese patients, the procedure time, fluoroscopy time, and dose area product (DAP) values were longer than those of non-obese patients: 89.74 +/- 20.54 vs 79.69 +/- 28.77 min (p = 0.035), 33.23 +/- 10.14 vs 38.17 +/- 8.61 min (p = 0.01) and 133.69 +/- 58.17 vs 232.56 +/- 51.87 Gy.cm(2) (p < 0.001). Although there was no difference in sac shrinkage at 12-month follow-up, there was a significant decrease at 6-month follow-up in both groups (p = 0.017). Endoleak occurred in 17.9% (n = 7) of the obese group versus 11.1% (n = 9) of the non-obese group (p = 0.302). Iliac branch occlusion developed in four patients, 3 (3.7%) in the non-obese group and 1 (2.6%) in the obese group (p = 0.608). The all-cause mortality rate was slightly higher in the obese group; however, it did not differ between the groups (p = 0.463). Conclusion In addition to the longer procedure times, fluoroscopy times, and DAP values in obese patients, regardless of obesity, significant sac shrinkage in the first 6 months of follow-up was observed in both groups. No difference was documented with regards to mortality or morbidity following EVAR.

Materials and Methods The Nationwide Inpatient Sample datasets were examined from 2008 to 2014. The International Classification of Diseases 9th Edition Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality comorbidity codes were used to assist in the data collection. Chi-square testing was conducted, using variables that positively correlated with DFUs. For descriptive statistics, the Student T-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and chi-square test were used. There were six predictive variables that were identified. A decision tree model CTREE was utilized to help develop an algorithm. Results 326,853 patients were noted to have DFU. The major variables that contributed to this diagnosis (both with p < 0.001) were cellulitis (OR 63.87, 95% CI [63.87-64.49]) and Charcot joint (OR 25.64, 95% CI [25.09-26.20]). The model performance of the six-variable testing data was 79.5% (80.6% sensitivity and 78.3% specificity). The area under the curve (AUC) for the 6-variable model was 0.88.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between PDW and lower extremity chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) by comparing the levels of PDW and other parameters derived from complete blood count (CBC) tests in young individuals with or without lower extremity CVI. Methods This prospective clinical study was conducted between January 2020 and December 2020. A total of 108 patients, 72 patients with lower extremity CVI (study group) and 36 healthy volunteers (control group) were enrolled from the Bursa Yuksek Ihtisas Education Research Hospital and the Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University Training and Research Hospital. The age range of the participants was between 18 and 50 years old. Participants' baseline clinical features and CBC parameters including PDW, white blood cell, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution width, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet count, mean platelet volume, plateletcrit, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio were compared between the two groups. Results The groups were statistically similar in terms of baseline clinical features. The median PDW value was significantly higher for the CVI patients relative to the control group (17.6 vs 16.8; p < 0.001). In terms of other CBC parameters, there were no significant differences between the groups. According to ROC analysis, area under the curve of PDW was 0.749 (95% confidence interval: 0.653-0.846 and p < 0.001). If the value of PDW was accepted as 17, it could predict CVI with 76% sensitivity and 59% specificity, whereas a PDW value of 17.5 could predict CVI with 51% sensitivity and 81% specificity. Conclusion Platelet distribution width might be a useful marker to determine an increased inflammatory response and thrombotic status in young patients with CVI.

Some states have been disproportionately affected such as New York and Michigan. In fact, Detroit and its surrounding areas have been named as the initial Midwest epicenter where over 106,000 cases have been confirmed in April 2020. Method, Results and Conclusions: Facilities in Southeast Michigan have served as the frontline of the pandemic in the Midwest and in order to cope with the surge, rapid, and in some cases, complete restructuring of care was mandatory to effect change and attempt to deal with the emerging crisis. We describe the initial experience and response of 4 large vascular surgery health systems in Michigan to COVID-19.

J	Xu, YX; Zhao, LX; Liu, H; Sun, B; Zhao, XX				Xu, Yuxia; Zhao, Lixiang; Liu, Hai; Sun, Bin; Zhao, Xinxiang			Diagnostic value of miR-637 in patients with atherosclerosis and its predictive significance for the future cardiovascular events	VASCULAR			English	Article						Atherosclerosis; miR-637; diagnosis; prognosis		Objectives Atherosclerosis is a common vascular disease. MiR-637 has been demonstrated to be low-expressed in hypertensive patients, and atherosclerosis is closely related to hypertension. Therefore, this study speculated that miR-637 may play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. In brief, this study examined the expression level of miR-637 in patients with atherosclerosis and further analyzed its clinical value in patients with atherosclerosis. Methods The expression level of miR-637 was detected in serum from 86 patients with atherosclerosis and 75 healthy controls by using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the diagnostic value of miR-637 in atherosclerosis. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between serum miR-637 and different clinical parameters. The prognostic value of miR-637 in atherosclerosis was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and multivariate cox regression analysis. Results Compared with healthy individuals, miR-637 was downregulated in the serum of atherosclerosis patients. The receiver operating characteristic curve suggested the high diagnostic value of miR-637 for atherosclerosis, with the AUC of 0.853, specificity of 77.9%, and sensitivity of 80.0%. The expression level of miR-637 was negatively correlated with CIMT (r = -0.8101, P < 0.0001) and CRP (r = -0.6154, P < 0.0001), respectively. Survival analysis indicated that miR-637 was also found to be an independent prognostic factor for atherosclerosis. Conclusions MiR-637 is a potential noninvasive diagnostic marker of atherosclerosis and has important predictive value for the occurrence of future cardiovascular events.

Management strategies are diverse and should be tailored to the patient's presentation. Methods We describe the case of a 40-year-old male who presented with a painful left leg mass in the setting of bacteremia and infective endocarditis. Imaging revealed an aneurysm of the anterior tibial artery. Results The patient was treated with antibiotics and open surgical repair with excision of the aneurysmal sac, ligation of the anterior tibial artery, and primary repair of the popliteal artery and tibioperoneal trunk. Conclusion The epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical management of infrapopliteal aneurysms are briefly reviewed in this case study.

In situ saphenous vein bypass is a standardized technique. The aim of this study was to report preliminary six-month outcomes of a national, multicenter, observational, prospective registry based on the examination of treatment of critical Limb IscheMia with infragenicular Bypass adopting the in situ SAphenous VEin technique (LIMBSAVE). Methods From January 2018 until October 2019, 428 patients from 41 centers were enrolled in the LIMBSAVE registry. Data were prospectively collected in a dedicated database, including demographics, preoperative risk factors, clinical and diagnostic preoperative assessments, intraoperative measures (including safety and effectiveness of the valvulotome during the surgical procedures), and 30-day follow-up data. Furthermore, estimated six-month outcomes according to Kaplan-Meier curves in terms of primary patency, primary assisted patency, secondary patency, and limb salvage were evaluated. Results Patients were predominantly male (n = 332, 77.6%) with a mean age of 73.3 years (range 39-95). Technical success, defined as bypass pulse after use of the valvulotome, was obtained in all cases. The proximal anastomosis could be reached by the valvulotome in all cases. The mean number of valvulotome uses was 2.5 (range 1-5). No vein perforation was reported. In nine cases (2.1%), a vein lesion with intramural hemorrhage occurred. The mean length of hospital stay was 11.1 days (range 1-60). At 30-day follow-up, the overall bypass patency rate was 97.4%, and the rate of open or endo reinterventions for failing bypass was 5.4%. At six-month follow-up, the estimated primary patency, primary assisted patency, secondary patency, and limb salvage were 78.1%, 86.2%, 92.1%, and 94.7%, respectively. Conclusions Preliminary intraprocedural outcomes of the LIMBSAVE registry show that the in situ technique with the valvulotome is safe and effective in disrupting valves and obtaining pulsatility in the saphenous vein. The complication rate related to the use of the valvulotome is low. The six-month preliminary outcomes in terms of overall patency and limb salvage are promising. Further examinations and continuous follow-up are needed to evaluate long-term outcomes.

Significant diameter mismatch was defined as >20% difference in the nominal diameter between the intended proximal and distal landing zones. Methods Patient A was an 84-year-old man with prior abdominal aortic aneurysm open repair with a straight 20 mm Dacron tube. He presented with a right common iliac artery aneurysm (o88 mm) with contained rupture. The Gore Viabahn endoprosthesis (9 mm x 5 cm) was inserted proximally about 15 mm above the occluded ostium of the internal iliac artery. Subsequently, the BeGraft Aortic (R) (16 mm x 48 mm) was inserted proximally up to the common iliac artery origin; its proximal portion was flared to 22 mm. Patient B was a 77-year-old man with prior endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with a Medtronic Endurant stent-graft. He presented with occlusion of the right limb of the aortic endoprosthesis and thrombosis that extended down to the level of the superficial femoral artery. After mechanical thrombectomy, two Gore Viabahn endoprosthesis (first one, 8 mm x 10 cm; second one, 10 mm x 15 cm) were inserted into the right iliac limb. Subsequently, the BeGraft Aortic (R) (12mm x 39mm) was inserted proximally up to the gate of the aortic stent-graft; its proximal portion was flared to 16 mm. Results Technical success and clinical success were achieved in both patients. Imaging follow-up (6 months for Patient A, 12 months for Patient B) showed correct placement of all stent-grafts without any graft-related adverse event. The patients remained free from new reinterventions or recurrent symptoms. Patient A died 8 months after the index procedure from acute respiratory failure after community acquired pneumonia. Conclusion Secondary relining with focal flaring of novel-generation balloon-expandable covered stents for endovascular treatment of significant diameter mismatch in the aorto-iliac territory is safe and feasible. Although mid-term results seem to be effective, longer follow-up is warranted to establish durability of the technique.

This review is aimed to examine current evidence on pathophysiology and management of Loeys-Dietz syndrome in current era. A comprehensive electronic search was done to identify the articles that discussed all the aspects of Loeys-Dietz syndrome, combined key words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were used. Relevant articles have been summarized in each relevant section. Loeys-Dietz syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder which has combined and multi-systemic manifestations. The increased breakdown of extracellular matrix predisposes an individual to developing aneurysms in the aortic tree which is undoubtedly the most significant complication of this disorder. Understanding the pathophysiology and natural history of Loeys-Dietz syndrome and regular surveillance is important to plan prophylactic interventions to prevent life-threatening aortic emergencies which can be fatal. Loeys-Dietz syndrome is an aggressive genetic condition that predisposes an individual to the development of life-threatening aortic aneurysms. Our understanding of Loeys-Dietz syndrome remains ever-changing and it is likely that the knowledge regarding its diagnosis and treatment will become more clearly defined in the coming years with deeper genetic studies.

J	Liu, GY; Xu, Q; Sun, M; Xiao, R				Liu, Guyue; Xu, Qing; Sun, Min; Xiao, Rong			Factors associated with the elasticity of asymptomatic carotid plaques in hypertension Tibetan population	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						shear wave elastography; carotid plaque; hypertension; Tibetan	ARTERIAL STIFFNESS; RISK-FACTORS; ATHEROSCLEROSIS; PREVALENCE; DISEASE	Aims Hypertension is a major risk factor for coronary, cerebrovascular, and the greatest cause of stroke. Half of stroke events are the result of cerebrovascular atherosclerosis, including carotid plaques. It is of major importance to detect which plaques are vulnerable, even though not yet ruptured. Due to the particularity of the Tibetan population, this study evaluated the elasticity of asymptomatic carotid plaques in Tibetan hypertension patients using shear wave elastography (SWE) and explored associated risk factors. Methods A total of 91 Tibetan patients were divided into normotension, grade 1-2, and grade 3 hypertension groups based on the level of blood pressure. All subjects underwent common duplex ultrasonic examination and SWE evaluation for carotid plaques. Elasticity of carotid plaque was assessed by Young's modulus. Results The final analysis included 126 plaques as representative plaques according to Total Plaque Risk Score. The mean and maximum Young's modulus in the grade 3 hypertension group were smaller, and more plaques with irregularity surface compared with the other two groups (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed drinking butter tea (beta = -0.220, p = 0.009; beta = -0.240, p = 0.004, respectively) was the independent factor associated with mean and maximum Young's modulus. Conclusions SWE is feasible for measurement of Young's modulus of carotid plaques. Plaques in the grade 3 hypertension group were more likely to become vulnerable ones. In hypertension Tibetan patients, drinking butter tea was an independent factor associated with mean and maximum Young's modulus of asymptomatic carotid plaque.

Methods A comprehensive review of the literature was performed through MedLine by two independent reviewers from 1990 to 2020 on reported cases of arterial stent late onset infection over arterial stents. The data about on the risk factors, clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes were collected. Results Twenty-two studies were selected as pertinent for the analysis, totalling 24 patients including the indexed case. Infection occurred at a median of 22 months postoperatively (range 2-120 months) over a bare metal stent in 66.7% (n 16) of cases versus 33.3% (n 8) over a covered stent. Clinical presentation included local symptoms (local pain, oedema, petechiae or skin rash) in 21 (87.5%) cases and non-specific systemic symptoms (fever, sepsis, chills and leucocytosis) in 8 cases (33.3%). In 4 cases (16.7%), patients presented with haemorrhagic shock upon arterial rupture. The bacteria most frequently encountered were S. aureus (54.2% of cases). Several factors were supposed to be responsible for the infection including among which procedure-related (non-aseptic technique, lack of prophylactic antibiotics and repetitive punctures at the access site) or related to pre-existing patient's clinical conditions (immunosuppression, diabetes and concurrent infection) have been considered responsible for the infection. Treatment consisted in antibiotics alone (2 patients, 8.3%) or in association with surgical explant, both with or and without revascularization (n 21, 87.5%). In one case, an endovascular coiling was performed. Complications occurred in 29.2% (n 7) of cases and included the need for amputation, bowel resection, endocarditis, pulmonary failure or pneumonia. Overall, three patients (12.5%) died from a septic shock or multi-organ failure. Conclusions Intravascular stent infection is a rare but fearsome condition associated with high morbidity and mortality.

Recently, many studies have shown that immune cells are closely associated with the development of atherosclerosis and calcification, but there are many conflicting viewpoints because of immune system complications, such as the pro-atherosclerotic and atheroprotective effects of regulatory B cells (Bregs), T helper type 2 (Th2) cells and T helper type 17 (Th17) cells. In this review, we summarize the studies on the roles of immune cells, especially lymphocytes and macrophages, in atherosclerotic calcification. Furthermore, we prepared graphs showing the relationship between T cells, B cells and macrophages and atherosclerotic calcification. Finally, we highlight some potential issues that are closely associated with the function of immune cells in atherosclerotic calcification. Based on current research results, this review summarizes the relationship between immune cells and atherosclerotic calcification, and it will be beneficial to understand the relationship of immune cells and atherosclerotic calcification.

Presence of arterial calcification is associated with major adverse events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary artery or carotid artery intervention. Even though there is a clear association between worse outcome and coronary-carotid calcification, there is no research that interrogated the relationship between iliac arterial calcification and clinical outcomes because of lack of data. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of iliac arterial calcification on procedure success rates and long-term outcomes among patients undergoing endovascular intervention. Methods The records of 453 consecutive patients who underwent endovascular intervention due to symptomatic peripheral artery disease were analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of heavy calcification of iliac arteries. For each group, technical aspects of procedures and subsequent clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results According to our study, the rate of restenosis following endovascular intervention at 6 and 12 months were similar between two groups. On the other hand, long-term restenosis was significantly higher in patients with heavy calcification of iliac arteries as compared to patients with low calcification on iliac arteries (32.2% vs. 12.8%, p < 0.05). Conclusions Our data showed that there was a strong association between heavy calcification of iliac arteries and long-term restenosis in patients undergoing endovascular intervention.

We reported the histopathological findings in human ex-vivo incompetent great saphenous veins following treatment with saline, polidocanol, mechanical ablation and MOCA using ClariVein device. Methods Twenty-four vein GSV specimens were obtained via traditional surgery and treated with four methods: Group A: 0.9% normal saline (NS); Group B: 3% polidocanol; Group C: mechanical ablation + 0.9% NS; Group D: mechanical ablation + 3% polidocanol (MOCA). Hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Masson's trichrome and immunohistochemical staining were performed on each specimen and integrated optical densities were measured with vWF and a-SMA stains and statistically evaluated. vWF staining was used to assess endothelial damage and a a-SMA staining was used to assess media injury. Results HE and Masson's trichrome staining of Groups C and D revealed severe damage to the endothelium and media compared to Groups A and B. The statistical result of vWF staining showed the damage of endothelium was significantly increased by Group D compared to Groups A, B and C. The statistical result of a-SMA staining showed the damage of media was significantly increased by Groups C and D compared to Groups A and B. Conclusions The mechanism of MOCA was caused by both endothelium damage and media tearing. The damage of endothelium was significantly increased by MOCA when compared with mechanical ablation alone.

Persistent primitive hypoglossal artery appears with a reported incidence between 0.03% and 0.2%. We report a case of recurrent transient ischemic attacks originating from proximal internal carotid artery stenosis associated with ipsilateral persistent primitive hypoglossal artery and give a review of the existing literature. Methods A 78-year-old patient with a medical history of two previous transient ischemic attacks consulted our emergency department with an acute left hemispheric stroke. Intravenous thrombolysis permitted complete resolution of symptoms. Concurrent Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance (MR) angiography revealed an unstable plaque causing 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery with a persistent primitive hypoglossal artery dominantly perfusing the posterior circulation, and bilateral hypoplastic vertebral arteries. Results Uneventful carotid artery stenting using a proximal protection device was performed, and the patient was discharged after 12 days. Six months follow-up was uneventful with a patent stent in the internal carotid artery. Conclusions Treatment of symptomatic carotid artery stenosis in the presence of persistent primitive hypoglossal artery is challenging. Management should be driven by patients' co-morbidities, the anatomical localization of the lesions and local expertise. In the case of a high origin of the persistent primary hypoglossal artery, carotid artery stenting with the use of a proximal cerebral protection device is probably the preferred and simplest approach.

The aim of this study is to investigate arterial stiffness by cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Methods This observational and cross-sectional study involved 59 subjects with AAA and 32 healthy subjects. All subjects underwent ultrasonography examination. CAVI was measured by VaSera-1000 CAVI instrument. Results Mean abdominal aortic diameter of AAA patients and controls were 43.88 +/- 9.28 mm and 20.43 +/- 3.14 mm, consecutively. Baseline clinical characteristics of the patients and controls were similar for age, presence of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease and smoking. Left ventricle ejection fraction and Left ventricle mass index (LVMI) were similar between groups. CAVI was significantly higher in patients with AAA than controls (9.74 +/- 1.50 vs. 7.60 +/- 1.07,p < 0.001). CAVI was positively correlated with AAA diameter (r = 0.461,p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with left ventricle ejection fraction (r= -0.254, p = 0.015). CAVI >8.3 had a sensitivity 89.8% and a specificity of 78.1% for predicting the presence of AAA in ROC analysis (area under curve = 0.897, 95%CI = 0.816-0.951,p < 0.001). Conclusion CAVI is increased in patients with AAA. Increased arterial stiffness may be a mechanical link between AAA, coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease or a common mechanism effects the arterial stiffness, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease and AAA. Therefore, CAVI may be used as a valuable marker for risk stratification for the development of AAA in susceptible patients.

Methods The rats were divided into three groups: the treatment group, the control group, and the sham operation group. The treatment group had a blocked thoracic aorta (landing zone 3 by Ishimaru - T11) + aortic bypass circulation for 20 min. In the control group, the thoracic aorta at the landing zone 3 was blocked for 20 min. In the sham operation group, only thoracotomy without thoracic aortic occlusion was performed. The mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) of the thoracic aorta and caudal artery before and after thoracic aortic occlusion was monitored intraoperatively. Spinal cord function was monitored by a transcranial motor evoked potential (Tc-MEP) during the operation. Spinal cord function was evaluated by the BBB scale (Basso, Beattie, & Bresnahan locomotor rating scale) scores at multiple postoperative time points. The spinal cord sections of the rats were observed for 7 days after surgery, and the survival curves were analyzed for 28 days after surgery. Results After aortic occlusion, the MABP of thoracic aorta decreased to 6% of that before occlusion, and the MABP of caudal artery decreased to 63% of that before occlusion in the treatment group. In the control group, the MABP of both thoracic aorta and caudal artery decreased to 19% of that before occlusion. The Tc-MEP waveform of the treatment group disappeared after 6 min, and that of the control group disappeared after 8 min until the end of surgery. There was no change in the Tc-MEP waveform in the sham operation group. The BBB score of the treatment group decreased more obviously than the control group, and there was a significant difference. There was no decrease in the sham group. Spinal cord sections showed a large number of degeneration and necrosis of neurons, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and proliferation of surrounding glial cells in the treatment group. In the control group, multiple neurons were necrotic. The histology of the sham operation group was normal. The 28-day survival rate of the treatment group was 73.3%, which was higher than the control group (40.0%), and there was a significant difference (p < 0.05). Conclusion Thoracic aortic occlusion combined with aortic bypass is an effective modeling method for rats with accurate modeling effects and high long-term survival rates.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm neck dilatation and sac remodeling in fenestrated compared to standard endovascular aortic repair	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Abdominal aortic aneurysm; endovascular aortic repair; fenestrated; aortic neck; sac remodeling	CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES; ENLARGEMENT; FIXATION	Objective Contemporary commercially available endovascular devices for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) include standard endovascular aortic repair (sEVAR) or fenestrated EVAR (fEVAR) endografts. However, aortic neck dilatation (AND) can occur in nearly 25% of patients following EVAR, resulting in loss of proximal seal with risk of aortic rupture. AND has not been well characterized in fEVAR, and direct comparisons studying AND between fEVAR and sEVAR have not been performed. This study aims to analyze AND in the infrarenal and suprarenal aortic segments, including seal zone, and quantify sac regression following fEVAR implantation compared to sEVAR. Method A retrospective review of prospectively collected data on 20 consecutive fEVAR patients (Cook Zenith (R) Fenestrated) and 20 sEVAR (Cook Zenith (R)) patients was performed. Demographic data, anatomic characteristics, procedural details, and clinical outcome were analyzed. Pre-operative, post-operative (1 month), and longest follow-up CT scan at an average of 29.3 months for fEVAR and 29.8 months for sEVAR were analyzed using a dedicated 3D workstation (iNtuition, TeraRecon Inc, Foster City, California). Abdominal aortic aneurysm neck diameter was measured in 5 mm increments, ranging from 20 mm above to 20 mm below the lowest renal artery. Sub-analysis comparing the fEVAR to the sEVAR group at 12 months and at greater than 30 months was performed. Standard statistical analysis was done. Results Demographic characteristics did not differ significantly between the two cohorts. The fEVAR group had a larger mean aortic diameter at the lowest renal artery, shorter infrarenal aortic neck length, increased prevalence of nonparallel neck shape, and longer AAA length. On follow-up imaging, the suprarenal aortic segment dilated significantly more at all locations in the fEVAR cohort, whereas the infrarenal aortic neck segment dilated significantly less compared to the sEVAR group. Compared to the sEVAR cohort, the fEVAR patients demonstrated significantly greater positive sac remodeling as evident by more sac diameter regression, and elongation of distance measured from the celiac axis to the most cephalad margin of the sac. Device migration, endoleak occurrence, re-intervention rate, and mortalities were similar in both groups. Conclusion Compared to sEVAR, patients undergoing fEVAR had greater extent of suprarenal AND, consistent with a more diseased native proximal aorta. However, the infrarenal neck, which is shorter and also more diseased in fEVAR patients, appears more stable in the post-operative period as compared to sEVAR. Moreover, the fEVAR cohort had significantly greater sac shrinkage and improved aortic remodeling. The suprarenal seal zone in fEVAR may result in a previously undescribed increased level of protection against infrarenal neck dilatation. We hypothesize that the resultant decreased endotension conferred by better seal zone may be responsible for a more dramatic sac shrinkage in fEVAR.

Methods This is a retrospective chart review at a tertiary-level healthcare system. IRB approval was waived per policy. Results We describe a case of Brucella aortitis acquired from habitual contact with wild hogs. Clinical presentation included lower back pain and elevated white blood cell count. Diagnosis was confirmed with imaging showing an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and serology revealing elevated Brucella antibodies titers. The patient was initially managed with endovascular aortic repair and combined oral and intravenous antibiotics therapy. He then underwent explanation and extra-anatomical bypass due to symptomatic periaortic infection and interval development of type I endoleak. The patient was asymptomatic after his final operation at 24 months of follow-up and remained on suppressive oral antibiotic therapy. Conclusions An aortic aneurysm secondary to Brucella is a rare entity. A detailed history of long-term exposure to animals may be a clue to obtain serologic testing. Operative debridement and re-establishing of reliable blood flow combined with long-term antibiotic suppression are the mainstay of treatment.

However, there have been few reports about their association in general Chinese population. Method We included a total of 1220 CIMT participants and 2440 matched controls, who had ultrasonography of carotid artery during 2009 and 2016. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for thickened CIMT risk associated with LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Result In the univariate logistic regression model, there was significant association between LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and thickened CIMT (Q4 vs. Q1, OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.60-2.36; p(trend) < 0.05). After adjusting for potential covariates, LDL-C/HDL-C ratio remained significantly associated with thickened CIMT (Q4 vs. Q1, OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.41-2.34, p(trend) < 0.001; >= 3.05 v.s. <3.05, OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.37-2.02). In subgroup analyses, the association between LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and thickened CIMT remained significant in the subgroups stratified by sex, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), hypertension, and fatty liver disease but only remained significant in the subgroups of >= 45 years (OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.46-2.76; P-trend<0.05), BMI >= 24 (kg/m(2)) (OR = 2.22; 95% CI = 1.63-3.03; Ptrend < 0.05) and BMI >= 25 (kg/m(2)) (OR = 2.50, 95% CI: 1.76-3.54; P-trend < 0.05), dyslipidemia (OR = 3.28, 95% CI: 1.83-5,85; P-trend < 0.001), and without periodontitis (OR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.54-2.81 ; Ptrend < 0.05) comparing Q4 to Q1. Similar results were observed in the subgroup analyses for LDL-C/HDL-C ratio >= 3.05 v.s. Conclusion High LDL-C/HDL-C ratio could significantly increase the risk of thickened CIMT independent of gender, IFG, hypertension, and fatty liver disease in general Chinese population.

Methods The venous outflow sites included basilic, cephalic, median antecubital, and deep veins. Comparisons among multiple groups were analyzed. Findings A total of 179 patients with forearm loop arteriovenous grafts met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 72 were basilic, 48 were cephalic, 44 were median antecubital, and 15 were deep. The median observation period was 19 months. The survival rate was 84.9% at 24 months and 78.2% at 48 months. Primary, secondary, and assisted primary patency rates for all arteriovenous grafts were 48.9%, 72.4%, and 68.4% at 12 months; 13.8%, 33.9%, and 23.6% at 24 months; and 0.6%, 4.6%, and 2.3% at 48 months, respectively. Differences in primary patency were statistically significant compared with those of secondary and assisted primary patency (P < 0.05). Primary patency rates for cephalic, median antecubital, basilic, and deep were 47.9%, 48.6%, 47.7%, and 40.0% at 12 months and 12.5%, 13.9%, 22.7%, and 0% at 24 months, respectively. Secondary patency rates for cephalic, median antecubital, basilic, and deep were 75.0%, 69.4%, 75.0%, and 73.3% at 12 months and 39.6%, 30.6%, 38.6%, and 13.3% at 24 months, respectively. There was no significant difference in primary thrombosis among basilic, cephalic, median antecubital and deep. There were no significant differences observed in primary or secondary patency rates among all the groups. Stenoses in the venous anastomosis and outflow vein were frequently observed in all types of arteriovenous grafts. Central venous stenosis was most commonly seen in deep (26.67%). On average, 1.9 interventions per patient were performed on the graft to maintain function. Conclusion Different venous outflow selections were not associated with long-term patency and the occurrence of thrombosis in hemodialysis forearm loop arteriovenous grafts.

J	Wrede, A; Lehti, L; Eiberg, JP; Acosta, S				Wrede, Axel; Lehti, Leena; Eiberg, Jonas Peter; Acosta, Stefan			Adherence to instruction for use after endovascular repair of popliteal artery aneurysm	VASCULAR			English	Article						Popliteal artery aneurysm; endovascular repair; Gore Viabahn&#174; Endoprosthesis; Instructions For Use; stent graft patency		Objectives Endovascular repair (ER) of popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA) is an alternative to open repair. However, there is no standardized protocol for when to opt for ER and the decision is therefore at the discretion of the clinician. This study aims to evaluate the adherence to the Instruction For Use (IFU) in patients undergoing ER for PAA and factors associated with stent graft patency at one year. Methods The adherence to IFU provided by the manufacturer in 55 patients treated with Gore Viabahn (R) Endoprosthesis with Heparin Bioactive Surface for PAA between 2009 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Duplex follow-up was performed at 30 days and one year. Results The two groups of patients treated within (n = 10) and not within (n = 45) IFU did not differ in patient demographics, diagnostic assessment, treatment or outcome. Forty-five patients (81.8%) received stent graft placement with at least one deviation according to IFU. Distal oversizing >20% was the most frequent deviation against IFU (n = 22, 40.0%). Primary patency at one year was 72%. Diameter size difference >1 mm between overlapping stent grafts (6/14 [43%], p = 0.013) and renal insufficiency (5/12 [42%], p = 0.0086) were associated with lower primary patency at one year. Age-adjusted analysis of tortuosity index (HR 1.78/SD, 95% CI 1.17-2.71; p = 0.0071) and maximal PAA angle (HR 1.73/SD, 95% CI 1.018-2.95; p = 0.043) were associated with major amputation/mortality at end of follow-up. Conclusion The majority of patients undergoing ER for PAA were not treated within IFU. Diameter size difference >1 mm between overlapping stent grafts was associated with a higher loss of primary patency at one year. Multi-center studies with larger sample size and long-term follow up of patency are warranted.

The published data are scarce with conflicting results regarding the evolution. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients submitted to endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with standard technique (S-EVAR) versus bell-bottom technique. Methods This retrospective cohort study compared the outcomes of standard endovascular aneurysm repair (<16 mm iliac limbs) and bell-bottom technique (>= 16 mm iliac limbs) in a tertiary vascular center between 2010 and 2015. The end points of this study were type IB endoleak, reintervention and 30-day mortality. The follow-up protocol included CT scans within 30 days of implantation and 12 months. Duplex ultrasound was performed yearly thereafter. Results Two hundred and three patients were treated with bell-bottom technique (n = 84, mean age 72.2 +/- 8.9) and S-EVAR (n = 119, mean age 72.7 +/- 8.4). The overall 30-day mortality was 1.9%, with no significant difference between groups. There was higher prevalence of coronary heart disease in the bell-bottom technique group compared to the S-EVAR group (41.6% vs. 18.4%, p < 0.01). One patient in the S-EVAR group (0.85%) and four patients in the bell-bottom technique (4.6%) developed type IB endoleak. The mean follow-up period was 35.2 +/- 30.4 months. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, freedom from type IB endoleak in 80 months was 85.2% in the bell-bottom technique group and 98.7% in the S-EVAR group (p = 0.05). The freedom from reintervention in 80 months was 74.0% in the bell-bottom technique group and 94.1% in the S-EVAR group (p = 0.6). Conclusions This study shows lower freedom from type IB endoleak in the bell-bottom group compared to the standard repair group. There is no significant difference in reoperation rate and 30-day mortality.

Traditionally, surgical intervention with prosthetic graft replacement or bypass graft implantation is performed. However, there are limited data in endovascular era. Methods We present a case of a 68-year-old male with a history of late EVAR graft occlusion treated with multiple surgical interventions (femorofemoral crossover, extra-anatomic bypass surgery, and thrombectomy) five years ago. Color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) and computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed thrombosis of the entire bypass graft. Endovascular recanalization and remodeling of the abdominal stent graft CTO was performed with a combination of bare stents and stent grafts. Rupture of the stent graft occurred on the right limb. A second covered stent was placed. Results At 12-month follow-up, the patient was symptom free. Color Doppler ultrasound surveillance showed patent aortic stent graft and downstream arteries. Conclusions Endovascular recanalization of aortic stent graft CTO is a viable option in patients with failed bypass graft.

A meta-analysis	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Abdominal aortic aneurysm; endovascular aneurysm repair; percutaneous access; meta-analysis	OPEN FEMORAL EXPOSURE; PERCLOSE PROGLIDE; OUTCOMES; CLOSURE; SAFETY; MULTICENTER; PREDICTORS; DEVICES	Objective The objective is to investigate whether percutaneous access (pEVAR) is superior to cutdown access (cEVAR) in terms of safety and efficacy during endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from January 1999 to December 2020 for studies reporting on the comparison between percutaneous and cutdown techniques for endovascular repair of AAAs. Outcomes evaluated were technical success rates, access site-related complications and operative time, and hospital stay. Results Four randomized controlled trials and nine observational studies with a total of 1683 patients comprising 2715 groin accesses were eligible for the meta-analysis. pEVAR was associated with a lower risk of overall complications (odds ratio (OR) = 0.63; p = .005) and seroma/lymphorrhea (OR, 0.18; p = .0001) and shortened operation time (MD = -39.04; p = .002) and the length of hospital stay (MD = -0.75; p < .00001) compared with cEVAR. The technical success rate for pEVAR was 95.1% (694/729), with an overall OR of 0.27 (95% CI 0.14-0.55, p = .0003) comparing pEVAR with cEVAR. Furthermore, pEVAR did not increase the risk of site infection, femoral artery thrombosis, postoperative hematoma, nerve injury, dissection, and bleeding. Conclusion Percutaneous endovascular aneurysm repair is a safe and effective method for the treatment of AAA. It reduces the risk of overall complications and shortens the operation time and hospital stay. The technical success rate of pEVAR is lower than that of cEVAR, which may be linked to the selection of patients, operator experience, and the use of ultrasound. Large definitive trials are required to draw robust conclusions.

A single-center retrospective analysis	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Omniflow; expanded polytetrafluoroethylene; peripheral arterial disease; femoro-popliteal bypass; biosynthetic graft	WIFI CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; RECOMMENDED STANDARDS; PREDICTIVE ABILITY; ANEURYSM FORMATION; VEIN; ISCHEMIA; SOCIETY; PROSTHESIS; ACCESS	Introduction: The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of Omniflow II biosynthetic vascular grafts as compared to synthetic expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts in infrainguinal bypass surgery. Methods: A single-center, retrospective, observational study was performed reviewing patients with critical limb ischemia who underwent infrainguinal bypass surgery between 2014 and 2018. Patients characteristics, graft characteristics, and treatment outcomes were collected. Patency rates were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Results: Sixty bypasses were performed in 57 patients. For above-knee surgery, six were Omniflow and 13 were synthetic. For below-knee surgery, 19 were Omniflow and 22 were synthetic. Patient characteristics between groups were similar. However, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification scores were higher in the Omniflow group as compared to ePTFE (88% was ASA 3 or higher versus 60%; p = 0.018). Furthermore, wound, ischemia, and foot infection (WIfI) composite scores were higher in the Omniflow group (p = 0.0001). There was a trend toward more active infection at time of surgery in the Omniflow group (40 vs 22.9%, p = 0.15). At 1 year, primary patency rates were 60.0% versus 46.9% for above-knee Omniflow versus ePTFE grafts, respectively (p = 0.72). Secondary patency rates were 80.0% versus 82.5% (p = 0.89), and limb salvage rates were 83.3% versus 100% (p = 0.14). For below-knee surgery, 1- and 2-year primary patency rates in Omniflow versus ePTFE grafts were 36.0% versus 41.8% (p = 0.60) and 36.0% versus 31.1% (p = 0.87). Secondary patency rates were 66.8% versus 75.2% at 1 year (p = 0.53) and 58.8% versus 48.3% (p = 0.77) at 2 years. Below-knee limb salvage rates for Omniflow versus ePTFE after 2 years were 88.0% versus 68.3% (p = 0.28), respectively. Aneurysmal degeneration occurred in 2/25 (8%) in the Omniflow group and 0/35 (0%) in the ePTFE group. Bypass infections occurred in 2/25 (8%) in the Omniflow group and 0/35 (0%) in the ePTFE group (p = 0.09). Conclusion: Omniflow bypasses were more commonly implanted in patients with higher limb infection rate as confirmed with a higher adapted WIfI score. A trend toward a higher infection rate of Omniflow grafts was observed but not statistically significant. Graft infection rates were relatively low and treatable with antibiotics. No significant difference in graft performance was observed. The choice between the two studied grafts remains based on surgeon's preference.	[van de Laar, Bart C.

J	Yigit, G				Yigit, Gorkem			Early outcomes of novel Temren atherectomy device combined with drug-coated balloon angioplasty for treatment of femoropopliteal lesions	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Femoral artery; endovascular procedures; atherectomy; peripheral arterial occlusive disease; balloon angioplasty	PERCUTANEOUS TRANSLUMINAL ANGIOPLASTY; ORBITAL ATHERECTOMY; DIRECTIONAL ATHERECTOMY; JETSTREAM ATHERECTOMY; OCCLUSIVE DISEASE; MULTICENTER; RESTENOSIS; PREVENTION; ARTERIES; THERAPY	Objectives In this study, perioperative properties and early outcomes of patients who underwent combined Temren rotational atherectomy (RA) and drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty treatment for complex femoropopliteal lesions in a single center were reported. Methods Between June 2019 and February 2020, 40 patients who underwent combined Temren RA and DCB treatment due to critical lower limb ischemia or claudication-limiting daily living activities were retrospectively evaluated. Results The mean age of patients was 73.2 +/- 7.8 years and the majority of the patients were male (65%). Of the patients, 17 had critical limb ischemia and 23 had lifestyle-limiting claudication. Pathologies were total occlusion in 33 limbs and critical stenosis in seven limbs. Nine patients previously underwent endovascular intervention or surgery. The mean total occlusion length was 140.9 +/- 100.9 (range, 20-360) mm in patients with chronic total occlusion. There was an additional iliac artery pathology in 5 and below the knee pathology in 8 patients. Rotational atherectomy was possible in all cases. Flow-limiting dissection was seen in six patients (15%). Provisional stent was performed to these patients. Following Temren RA, all patients underwent DCB. Adequate vascular lumen (less than 30% stenosis) was provided in all patients and the symptoms regressed. No distal embolization was encountered. Access site complications (17.5%) were small hematoma in four patients, ecchymosis in two patients, and pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery in one patient. The mean follow-up was 13.55 +/- 4.2 (range, 1-18) months. Re-occlusion was seen in three patients (7.5%) (n = 2 at 2 months and n = 1 at 4 months). Of these patients, two had required open revascularization via femoropopliteal bypass graft with common, superficial femoral, and popliteal artery endarterectomy and one had required femoro-posterior tibial artery bypass. Four minor toe amputations (10%) were performed to reach complete wound healing in the critical limb ischemia patients. A below-knee amputation was performed in a 94-year-old patient with long segment stenosis at the end of a 1-month follow-up period. There was no mortality after follow-ups. The Kaplan-Meier estimator estimated the rate of freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) which was 92.3%. The decrease in the Rutherford levels after the procedure was found to be statistically significant in 36 patients (p < 0.001). The increase in the ankle-brachial index after the procedure was found to be statistically significant in 36 patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions Combined use of Temren RA with adjunctive DCB is safe and effective method with high rates of primary patency and freedom from TLR and low rates of complication in the treatment of femoropopliteal lesions.

Methods The National Inpatient Sample database was utilized to identify diabetic patients who underwent lower extremity revascularization and amputation procedures between 2008 and 2014. International Classification of Diseases 9th edition codes were used to identify the procedures, diagnoses, and comorbidities. Results We identified 38,143 diabetic patients who underwent endovascular revascularization and 25,415 who underwent open revascularization between 2008 and 2014. The number of endovascular and open revascularization procedures decreased steadily by 17.5% and 12.43% during the study period, respectively. The total charges for the endovascular procedure were greater than the open procedure ($98,761 vs. $80,782, p <= 0.001) despite similar median length of stay (5 days (inner quartile range (IQR) = 1-10) vs. 5 days (IQR = 3-10), p <= 0.001). Compared to open, the in-patient amputation rate for endovascular patients has been increasing faster for both minor (11.75% vs. 0.37%) and major amputations (3.08% vs. 0.19%). Although the post-procedure amputation rates between endovascular and open procedures were increased for endovascular patients (odds ratio [OR] = 1.71, confidence interval [CI] = 1.35-2.18, p <= 0.001) in 2008, by 2014 the risk of major amputation was doubled in endovascular patients (OR = 2.88, CI = 2.27-3.64, p <= 0.001). African Americans were more likely to undergo minor amputation than Whites (p <= 0.001). Lastly, diabetic patients with uncontrolled diabetes, systemic infection, weight loss, congestive heart failure, gangrene, and end-stage renal disease were more likely to undergo endovascular repair. Conclusions As more medically complex patients undergo endovascular revascularization, endovascular revascularization for diabetic patients is becoming associated with higher total cost despite similar length of stay, minor amputation, and major amputation rates. Further studies are needed to continuously evaluate the post-procedural outcomes and cost effectiveness of this trend.

This study seeks to demonstrate how a standardized protocol to prevent spinal cord ischemia affects incidence in patients undergoing TEVAR. Methods Using CPT codes 33880 and 33881, all TEVAR procedures performed at a single tertiary care center from January 2017 to December 2018 were examined. Patients who had concomitant ascending aortic repairs or a TEVAR for traumatic indications were excluded from analysis, leaving 130 TEVAR procedures. Comorbid conditions, procedural characteristics, extent of coverage, peri-procedural management strategies, and post-operative outcomes were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Results One hundred thirty patients undergoing TEVAR were examined for four perioperative variables: postoperative hemoglobin greater than 10 g/dL, subclavian revascularization, preoperative spinal drain placement, and somatosensory evoked potential monitoring (SSEP). All conditions were met in 46.2% (60/130) of procedures; 37.8% (28/74) in emergent/urgent cases and 61.5% (32/52) in elective cases. Of patients who required subclavian coverage, 87.1% (54/62) underwent subclavian revascularization; 70.8% (92/130) of patients received spinal drains preoperatively; 68.5% (89/130) of patients had SSEP monitoring; 73.8% (93/130) of patients obtained a postoperative hemoglobin of >10 g/dL. Out of all patients, two (1.5%) developed spinal cord ischemia. Conclusion Incidence of spinal cord ischemia in our cohort was low at 1.5% (2/130). Individual and bundled interventions for the prevention of spinal cord ischemia were unable to demonstrate a statistically significant effect given the low rate. Nonetheless, we advocate for a proactive approach for the prevention of spinal cord ischemia given our experience in this complex population.

E.; Yeung, Kak K.; Wisselink, Willem			Robot-assisted transthoracic first rib resection for venous thoracic outlet syndrome	VASCULAR			English	Article						First rib resection; Paget-Schroetter syndrome; robot assisted; venous thoracic outlet syndrome		Background Venous thoracic outlet syndrome (vTOS) is caused by external compression of the subclavian vein at the costoclavicular junction. It can be subdivided in McCleery Syndrome and Paget-Schroetter Syndrome (PSS). To improve the venous outflow of the arm and to prevent recurrent thrombosis, first rib resection with venolysis of the subclavian vein can be performed. Open transaxillary, supraclavicular, infraclavicular or combined paraclavicular approaches are well known, but more recent robot-assisted techniques are introduced. We report our short- and long-term results of a minimal invasive transthoracic approach for resection of the anteromedial part of the first rib using the DaVinci surgical robot, performed through three trocars. Methods We analyzed all patients with vTOS who were scheduled to undergo robot-assisted transthoracic first rib resection in the period July 2012 to May 2016. Outcomes were: technical success, operation time, blood loss, hospital stay, 30-day complications and patency. Functional outcomes were assessed using the "Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand" (DASH) questionnaire. Results Fifteen patients (8 male, 7 female; mean age 32.9 years, range 20-54 years) underwent robot-assisted transthoracic first rib resection. Conversion to transaxillary resection was necessary in three patients. Average operation time was 147.9 min (range 88-320 min) with a mean blood loss of 79.5 cc (range 10-550 cc). Mean hospital stay was 3.5 days (range 2-9). In three patients, complications were reported (Clavien-Dindo grade 2-3a). Patency was 91% at 15.5 months' follow-up. DASH scores at one and three years showed excellent functional outcomes (7.1 (SD= 6.9, range 0-20.8) and 6.0 (SD= 6.4, range 0-25)) and are comparable to the scores of the normative general population. Conclusion Robot-assisted transthoracic first rib resection with only three trocars is a feasible minimal invasive approach for first rib resection in the management of vTOS. This technique enables the surgeon to perform venolysis under direct 3D vision with good patency and long-term functional outcome. Studies with larger cohort size are needed to compare the outcomes of this robot-assisted technique with other more established approaches.

Methods A 50 years' old man with history of BD was accidentally diagnosed Crawford extent IV TAAA during computed tomography follow-up after left nephrectomy of renal carcinoma. The aneurysm extended from descending aorta to right common iliac artery with a maximum diameter of 6.2 cm. Results The endovascular procedure wassuccessfully performed using custom-designed branched component to cannulate visceral arteries, bifurcated endograft and iliac legs to exclude the aneurysm sac in abdominal aorta and an iliac branched device to preserve the right internal iliac artery. The patient was discharged without any complication. Computed tomography angiogram at one month after endovascular repair demonstrated total exclusion of the aneurysm, patent visceral branches and right internal iliac artery. No complication occurred to six-month follow-up. Conclusion Endovascular treatment of stable TAAA in patients with Behc?et's disease using custom-designed branched device is feasible, microinvasive and safe. The long-term efficacy needs to be observed.

Aortic endograft and bridging stent-graft remodeling after branched endovascular aortic repair	VASCULAR			English	Article						Branched endovascular aortic repair; aortic main body; bridging stent grafts; remodeling; branch tortuosity index		Objectives The results of branched endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms are mainly dependent on durability of the graft used. The purpose of this study was to evaluate postoperative aortic main body and bridging stent-graft remodeling, and their impact on bridging stent-graft instability at one year. Methods Computed tomoangiographies of 43 patients (43 aortic main body mated with 171 bridging stent-grafts) were analyzed before and after branched endovascular repair as well as after a follow-up of 12 months. Primary endpoint was aortic main body remodeling (migration >5 mm, shortening >5 mm, scoliosis >5 degrees or lordosis >5 degrees). Shortening was defined as a reduced length in the long axis, scoliosis as left-right curvature, and lordosis as antero-posterior curvature. Aortic main body remodeling, aneurysm sac changes, and bridging stent-graft tortuosity were evaluated to study their correlations and the impact on the bridging stent-graft instability. Results At 12 months, aortic main body remodeling was observed in 72% of the cases, migration in 39.5% (mean 5.21 mm), shortening in 41.9% (mean 5.79 mm), scoliosis in 58.1%, (mean 10.10 degrees), lordosis in 44.2% (mean 5.78 degrees). Migration, shortening, and scoliosis were more frequent in patients with larger aneurysms (p = .005), while scoliosis was significantly more frequent in type II thoracoabdominal aneurysm (p = .019). Aortic main body remodeling was significantly associated to bridging stent-graft remodeling (r: 0.3-0.48). The bridging stent-graft instability rate was 9.3%. Despite a trend toward significance (p = .07), none of the evaluated aortic main body and bridging stent-graft changes were associated with bridging stent-graft instability at 12 months. Conclusions Aortic main body remodeling is frequent especially in large and extended thoracoabdominal aneurysm aneurysms. Aortic main body and bridging stent-graft remodeling was significantly correlated. While these geometric changes had no significant impact on bridging stent-graft instability at one year, a close long-term follow-up after branched endovascular repair could predict bridging stent-graft failures.

Methods We report the first commercial use of the Medtronic Valiant Navion stent graft for treatment of an 85-year-old woman with a 5.8 cm DTAA and a highly tortuous thoracic aorta. Results A percutaneous TEVAR was performed using a two-piece combination of the Valiant Navion FreeFlo and CoveredSeal stent graft configurations for zones 2-5 coverage. The devices were successfully delievered through highly tortuous anatomy and deployed, excluding the entire length of the aneurysm with precise landing, excellent apposition and no evidence of endoleak. The patient tolerated the procedure well and has had no stent graft-related complications through one-year follow-up. Conclusions Design enhancements such as a lower profile delivery system, better conformability, and a shorter tapered tip are some of the improvements to this third-generation TEVAR device. Coupled with the multiple configuration options available, this gives physicians a better tool to treat thoracic aortic pathologies in patients with challenging anatomy. The early results are encouraging, and evaluation of long-term outcomes will continue.

Efficacy and safety of apixaban in patients with active malignancy and acute deep venous thrombosis	VASCULAR			English	Article						Deep venous thrombosis; venous thromboembolism; apixaban; enoxaparin; malignancy		Objectives: Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been approved for treatment of deep venous thrombosis and venous thromboembolism which are associated with cancer. The efficacy and safety of apixaban in management of acute deep venous thrombosis associated with active malignancy is still an unresolved issue. The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apixaban in patients with acute deep venous thrombosis and active malignancy compared with weight adjusted subcutaneous LMWH. Methods: Of 138 randomized patients, 100 patients with active malignancy presenting with acute deep venous thrombosis and still treated with chemotherapy were assigned to either oral apixaban therapy or subcutaneous low-molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) through randomized clinical study in 1:1 ratio. All patients were followed up to six months. The primary end point was major bleeding, while secondary end points were recurrent deep venous thrombosis or venous thromboembolism, minor or non-fatal bleeding and mortality related to massive pulmonary embolism. Results: Both groups were matched regarding their baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics. We had 84 patients with metastatic cancer (stage 4). The most prevalent type of malignancy was cancer colon (42% of cases). There was no significant difference between both groups regarding the incidence of primary and secondary end points. There were no reported mortality cases related to massive pulmonary embolism in both groups. Conclusion: In this limited study, there was no difference in the major bleeding, recurrent deep venous thrombosis or minor bleeding in patients with active malignancy when treated with either apixaban or LMWH.

J	Singh, A; Kumar, N; Jain, AP; Verma, R; Krishna, V				Singh, Amit; Kumar, Neeraj; Jain, Ajitesh P.; Verma, Rakesh; Krishna, Vinay			Endovascular management of critical hand ischemia by 'palmar arch loop' technique	VASCULAR			English	Article						Palmar arch loop; critical hand ischemia; endovascular hand salvage	RADIAL ARTERY; ANGIOPLASTY; PATIENT	Introduction Critical hand ischemia with advancing gangrene of digits requires urgent intervention to salvage as much tissue as possible. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of "palmar arch loop" technique for endovascular management of critical hand ischemia by establishing inline flow to the palmar arch via both radial artery and ulnar artery, in patients with failed antegrade recanalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case series evaluating the efficacy of "palmar arch loop" technique, with retrograde percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the involved radial artery and/or ulnar artery. Material and methods We retrospectively investigated 10 patients (60% female; mean age 42 +/- 18 years; mean time of presentation post-acute event 24 +/- 11 days) with critical hand ischemia undergoing endovascular intervention using "palmar arch loop" technique at a single center in northern India between April 2017 and March 2019. All patients were followed up at regular intervals (weekly for a month, fortnightly for 3 months, and then at 6 and 12 months) with clinical assessment and SpO(2) measurement. Study end points were technical success rate, hand healing, and primary patency rate at one year. Results Causes for critical hand ischemia were iatrogenic injuries due to inadvertent intra-arterial injection in 50% (n = 5) and thromboembolic events in 50% patients (n = 5). Vessels involved were: both radial artery and ulnar artery along with the PA in 50%; radial artery and palmar arch in 30%; ulnar artery and palmar arch in 20%. All of them had total occlusion of the involved vessel (>2/3rd of total length) with occlusion/diffuse disease of palmar arch as well; 70% technical success rate was achieved ensuring inflow to palmar arch via both the arteries with improved flow distally to the common and proper digital arteries. Retrograde percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of radial artery in 50% (n = 5) and ulnar artery in 20% (n = 2) was done successfully by looping the guidewire across the palmar arch; 90% showed subjective improvement in pain with healing of the lesions and/or formation of clear line of demarcation with reversal of pregangrenous changes proximally. Out of the eight patients with gangrene of fingers, three underwent minor amputation of the gangrenous digits and five underwent auto-amputation of the gangrenous tissue with complete healing of the stump. Primary patency rate was 85.7% at one year. There was no access site-related complication or mortality in the follow-up period. Conclusions Endovascular management of critical hand ischemia by "palmar arch loop" technique is an efficient technique to deal with occluded forearm vessels, particularly when antegrade recanalization fails. This technique, with good technical success and patency rates, is potentially a unique tool in the endovascular armamentarium for salvaging hand.

However, scar in the groin is considered a contraindication or an exclusion criterion for percutaneous procedures. The aim of our study was to investigate the outcomes and safety of Pro-Glide device as suture-mediated closure device in patients who underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair with percutaneous femoral access >= 22 F who had previous groin intervention. Methods A total of 73 patients who underwent endovascular repair with percutaneous femoral access were retrospectively included in the study. Previous groin intervention was defined as history of open surgical access or large sheath insertion (>18 F) to femoral artery because of endovascular or valvular intervention. Patients were divided into two groups as who had previous groin intervention PGI (+) and had not PGI (-). Results A total of 73 patients [60 male (82.2%)] were included in the study. Seventeen patients had PGI, and 56 did not. When groups were compared in terms of sheath sizes, a significantly higher sheath sizes were used in PGI (+) patients (24.5 +/- 1.1 F vs. 23.8 +/- 0.9 F,p = 0.005). The overall success rate in the femoral approach with pre-close technique was statistically insignificant between two groups (94.1% vs. 96.4%,p = 0.55). One patient in PGI (+) group and two patients in PGI (-) had technical failure for percutaneous femoral approach. One patient (5.9%) in PGI (+) group and one patient (1.8%) in PGI (-) group had femoral complications after the procedures; however, there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of complications (5.9% vs. 1.8%,p = 0.13). Conclusion Pro-Glide device may be a safe and less invasive method for femoral access in patients with PGI and might not be considered as a contraindication for patients with history of PGI.

Materials and methods All consecutive patients with GSV incompetence and varicose veins underwent RFA were enrolled between 2009 and 2018. Data on demographic, pre- and postoperative color Doppler scan (CDUS) findings, perioperative complications, and follow-up were prospectively collected. Primary outcome was GSV recanalization rate at 1 week after RFA. Secondary outcomes were postoperative complication rate, as well as GSV recanalization rate at 1, 3, and 5 years after RFA. Risk factors for recanalization were also analyzed, for each follow-up assessment, identifying differences in recanalized (Rec) and non-recanalized (nRec) groups. Results During the study period, 1297 patients were treated. Among these, 1265 had at least 1 week of follow-up. Mean follow-up time was 3.0 +/- 1.9 years. Recanalization rate at 1 week, 1, 3, and 5 years was 2.4%, 4.3%, 9.3%, and 17.5%, respectively. After multivariate analysis for each follow-up evaluation, CEAP classes C4 and 5, as well as preoperative GSV diameter >6 mm and history of smoking were found to be independent predictors of recanalization. Furthermore, age >61 years and postoperative complications such as pigmentation, edema, and paresthesia were found to be dependent risk factors. Conclusion RFA remains a safe and durable technique to ablate incompetent GSV. Despite this, particular attention should be paid to patients with high CEAP classes to avoid short and long-term recanalization.

Patients who fail medical treatment remain with very limited surgical options due to the difficulty of any intervention in this "no man's land" area of the hand, as described since 1918. Extended distal periarterial sympathectomy is reported as an effective treatment option since the eighties of last century. The procedure entails large incisions and major technical difficulties. In this study, we describe a less invasive approach with very promising results and equally high success rates. Materials and Methods This was a prospective study. All patients with severe digital ischemia manifesting with bluish discoloration, ulceration, and/or dry gangrene who failed medical treatment underwent distal periarterial sympathectomy for the radial and ulnar arteries, with added digital sympathectomy in very severe cases. Primary endpoints were ulcer healing and improvement in pain scores assessed by Visual Analog Scale pain scoring system. Secondary endpoints included complications and amputation rates. Results This study recruited 17 patients between January 2019 and January 2020. The mean follow-up was 14.6 months. The mean age was 33.71 (+/- SD 13.14) years. 41% were males. 59% suffered from vasculitis, 35% of patients had dry gangrene, and 71% had ulcers. Periarterial radial and ulnar sympathectomy was performed for all cases, with digital sympathectomy for 12 fingers. We had 50% complete ulcer healing within 1 month (p = 0.031), and 100% were completely healed at 6 months (p < 0.001). Pain scores showed significant reductions at 1 (p = 0.001) and 6 months (p < 0.001) of follow-up. Conclusion Distal periarterial sympathectomy demonstrates high success rates in terms of pain relief and ulcer healing in severe digital ischemia.

J	Bertagna, G; Adami, D; Del Corso, A				Bertagna, Giulia; Adami, Daniele; Del Corso, Andrea			Percutaneous glue embolization of arteriovenous fistula of in situ saphenous vein bypass graft: Case report and literature review	VASCULAR			English	Review; Early Access						glue embolization; arteriovenous fistula; venous peripheral bypass graft	PSEUDOANEURYSMS	Objectives Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) of an in situ saphenous vein bypass can be managed surgically or through endovascular coil embolization. The complications associated with the surgical wounds required for side branch ligature can be minimized through selective vein ligature and interrupted small incisions, but endovascular methods are time-consuming and limited by vein size. In this case report, we describe percutaneous ultrasound (US)-guided balloon-assisted direct glue injection as an alternative treatment strategy for AVF closure. Methods We treated a patient with a delayed AVF in a femoral-popliteal in situ saphenous vein bypass. The patient came to our attention for the recurrence of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CTLI) 4 years after the initial bypass creation. Ultrasound and computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed a double tandem graft in significant stenosis below an AVF connected with the deep venous system. Treatment included percutaneous angioplasty of the bypass stenosis and contemporary AVF closure via ultrasound-guided glue injection. Results We successfully performed endovascular angioplasty with a drug-eluting balloon of the bypass stenosis and ultrasound-guided fistula embolization with cyanoacrylate Glubran 2. Angiography after the procedure showed bypass graft patency, no residual stenosis, and complete closure of the AVF. Results were confirmed with US. Conclusions Percutaneous embolization using glue could be a useful technique for AVF closure. It is a minimally invasive method that reduces the need for skin incisions during in situ saphenous grafting or endovascular revascularization.

Prolongation of access life and usability with minimization of these adverse events is paramount. Endovascular methods are established first-line interventions for failing arteriovenous access and treatment of venous outflow stenoses. The Primary goal of this feasibility study was to evaluate intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) during interventional treatments on outcomes in those undergoing angiography for failing hemodialysis access. Secondary goals were to determine differences between IVUS and angiography on vessel and lesion characteristics and impact on treatment. Methods In this prospective, randomized controlled trial, patients scheduled for angiography to evaluate and treat a failing hemodialysis access were randomized to use of angiography (DSA) alone or angiography plus IVUS (DSA + IVUS). Patients were treated by a standardized protocol and seen in follow-up at 2 weeks, and every 3 months for 2 years or until a study endpoint was reached. Measurement of vessel diameters, % stenosis, lesion length, and study endpoints (AV access thrombosis, re-intervention, or surgical revision) were recorded. Results A total of 55 subjects were enrolled, 27 in the DSA cohort and 28 in the DSA + IVUS cohort. There were 41 treated lesions in each group. Freedom from the composite endpoint of AV access thrombosis or re-intervention was 46.3% in the DSA cohort and 61.0% in the DSA + IVUS cohort (p = 0.27). Diameter measurements matched between the two imaging modalities only 9 times out of 41 total comparison measures. In pre-treatment lesions with >80% stenosis, IVUS had a greater tendency than DSA to underestimate the severity of stenosis, whereas in pre-treatment lesions with 50-80% stenosis, DSA was more likely than IVUS to underestimate the severity of stenosis. Post-treatment % stenosis had mean difference of -7.5% between DSA versus DSA + IVUS cohorts. In five lesions with <30% stenosis measured by angiogram, IVUS led to treatment escalation. Conclusion In the interventional treatment of failing angioaccess, IVUS and angiography differ in the vast majority of cases in measurement of vessel diameter. A significant number of patients were found to have suboptimal therapeutic response by IVUS only, which led to an escalation in treatment, and in over one-third of cases, the IVUS results led to a change in treatment plan. The improved patency rates in the IVUS group was not statistically significant in this small population but should be further investigated in a larger trial.

J	Su, ZX; Gu, YQ				Su, Zhixiang; Gu, Yongquan			Identification of key genes and pathways involved in abdominal aortic aneurysm initiation and progression	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						abdominal aortic aneurysm; key genes; pathways analysis	EXPRESSION; PATHOGENESIS; P53; PROLIFERATION; ACTIVATION; EXOCYTOSIS; PROTEINS; CATALASE; DYNLL1; SNARE	Objective The study aimed to assess the gene expression profile of biopsies obtained from the neck of human abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and the main site of AAA dilatation and to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the development of AAA. Methods The microarray profile of GSE47472 and GSE57691 were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The GSE47472 was a microarray dataset of tissues from the aortic neck of AAA patients versus normal controls. The GSE57691 was a microarray dataset including the tissues from main site of AAA dilatation versus normal controls. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were chosen using the R package and annotated by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomics (KEGG). The hub genes were identified in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Results 342 upregulated DEGs and 949 downregulated DEGs were obtained from GSE47472. The upregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in biological regulation (ontology: BP), the membrane (ontology: CC), and protein binding (ontology: MF), and the downregulated genes were mainly enriched in biological regulation (ontology: BP), the membrane (ontology: CC), and protein blinding (ontology: MF). In the KEGG enrichment analysis, the DEGs mainly involved glycosaminoglycan degradation, vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption, and pyruvate metabolism. The hub genes in GSE47472 mainly include VAMP8, PTPRC, DYNLL1, RPL38, RPS4X, HNRNPA1, PRMT1, TGOLN2, PA2G4, and CUL2. From GSE57691, 248 upregulated DEGs and 1120 downregulated DEGs were selected. The upregulated DEGs of GSE57691 were mainly enriched in biological regulation (ontology: BP), the membrane (ontology: CC), and protein binding (ontology: MF), and the downregulated genes were mainly enriched in metabolic process (ontology: BP), the membrane (ontology: CC), and protein blinding (ontology: MF). In the KEGG enrichment analysis, the DEGs mainly involved the mitochondrial respiratory, respiratory chain complex, and respiratory chain. RPS15A, RPS5, RPL23, RPL27A, RPS24, RPL35A, RPS4X, RPL7, RPS25, and RPL21 were identified as the hub genes. Conclusion At the early stage of AAA, the current study indicated the importance of glycosaminoglycan degradation and anaerobic metabolism. We also identified several hub genes closely related to AAA (VAMP8, PTPRC, DYNLL1, etc.). At the progression of the AAA, the dysfunctional mitochondria played a critical role in AAA formation and the RPS15A, RPS5, RPL23, etc., were identified as the hub genes.

Methods Between January 2015 and December 2018, 11 diabetic patients at high risk for "major amputation", with calcific lesions of the common femoral artery and ischemic ulcers requiring endovascular treatment were retrospectively evaluated. Technical success was defined as revascularization of the common femoral artery with a residual stenosis lower than 30%. Primary endpoints were an immediate increase of perilesional transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TCPO2) > 40 mmHg, ulcerative lesions improvement up to healing or skin flaps re-epithelialization after minor amputation, limb rescue with rejected major amputation, and resolution of rest pain if present. Results The success rate of the revascularization procedures was 100%. No patient underwent surgical conversion. One case of peri-operative bleeding at the brachial access site was observed. There were no cases of arterial dissection or undesired distal embolization. The average baseline value of perilesional TCPO2 was 21.8 +/- 9.2 mmHg. The mean TCPO2 value was 57.4 +/- 7.2 mmHg three days after the procedure (P < 0.05), and 51.2 +/- 9.8 mmHg 15 days after (P < 0.05). Minor amputations were performed in five patients with advanced ulcerative lesions. No major amputations were performed in the follow-up period. At 14 months follow-up, one patient developed new occlusion of the CFA for extension from the external iliac artery and underwent a new endovascular procedure. We observed an overall primary patency rate of 91% and a primary assisted patency rate of 100% in our 18-month follow-up. Conclusions Endovascular approach for severely calcified atherosclerotic lesions of the common femoral artery seems to represent a valid therapeutic option associated with promising results in terms of clinical outcome and low complication rates.

J	Pala, AA; Urcun, YS				Pala, Arda Aybars; Urcun, Yusuf Salim			Relationship of triglyceride-glucose index with chronic limb-threatening ischemia in lower extremity peripheral artery disease	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Chronic limb-threatening ischemia; insulin resistance; peripheral artery disease; triglyceride-glucose index		Objectives Triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index), which is defined as the simple and novel marker of insulin resistance, is becoming increasingly important as a promising predictive marker for atherosclerotic diseases. Chronic limb-threatening ischemia is defined as the most advanced stage of the lower extremity peripheral artery disease, whose main cause is atherosclerosis and is associated in this respect with amputation, impaired quality of life, and mortality. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the relation between the calculated TyG index values and chronic limb-threatening ischemia development. Methods A total of 296 patients who were diagnosed with lower extremity peripheral artery disease in our outpatient clinic between October 2018 and October 2020 were included in this study retrospectively. Two groups were formed by clinically staging the patients according to Rutherford Classification. Patients who did not develop chronic limb-threatening ischemia were classified as "Group 1" (n = 224) and those who developed were classified as "Group 2" (n = 72). Results The mean TyG index values that were calculated in Group 2 were significantly higher than in Group 1 (9.27 +/- 0.31 vs. 9.00 +/- 0.34, p < 0.001). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis conducted to determine the predictors of chronic limb-threatening ischemia development, C-reactive protein (OR [Odds Ratio]: 1.220, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.092-1.363, p < 0.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR: 0.775, 95% CI: 0.715-0.839, p < 0.001) and TyG index (OR: 5.796, 95% CI: 2.050-16.382, p = 0.001) were identified as independent predictors. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the cut-off value of TyG index was 9.13 (area under the curve: 0.721, p < 0.001) with 70.8% sensitivity and 65.2% specificity. The TyG index was significantly correlated with Rutherford category, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and mean platelet volume. Conclusions Chronic limb-threatening ischemia development may be predicted with the TyG index value, which is calculated easily from routine biochemical parameters, in patients diagnosed with lower extremity peripheral artery disease.

The presence of some CI-AKI risk factors has already been investigated. In this study, we evaluated the predictors of CI-AKI after carotid artery stenting. Methods A total of 389 patients with 50% to 99% carotid artery stenosis who underwent carotid artery stenting were included in this study. Patients were grouped according to CI-AKI status. Results CI-AKI developed in 26 (6.6%) patients. Age, baseline creatinine level, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio were higher and estimated glomerular filtration rate, haemoglobin and lymphocyte count were lower in CI-AKI patients. In the multivariate regression analysis, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio triggered a 1.39- to 2.63-fold increase in the risk of CI-AKI onset (p < 0.001). Conclusions The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio may be a significant predictor of CI-AKI in patients with carotid artery stenting and higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio values may be independently associated with CI-AKI.

Clinical outcomes and overview of dedicated venous stents for management of chronic iliocaval and femoral deep venous disease	VASCULAR			English	Review						DVT; endovenous; venous stent; post-thrombotic syndrome; May&#8211; Thurner syndrome; NIVL		Objectives Venous stenting of the lower extremities has grown in popularity and is now considered a key component of the primary treatment strategy for the management of pathologically obstructive or stenotic lesions of the deep venous system. This review aims to provide an overview of the role of venous stenting in the management of chronic conditions affecting the deep venous system of the lower limbs. Methods An overview of venous stents design and current role of stenting procedure in individuals presenting with Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) and presenting the current trials of dedicated venous stenting in management of chronic deep venous lesions. This review provides a focused insight on venous stent design, physical properties and the available dedicated venous stents selected studies with their related patency outcome based on selective literature search of the PubMed database and Cochrane library. Conclusions Dedicated venous stent technology is advancing at a rapid pace alongside the increased undertaking of endovascular deep venous stent reconstruction in the management of iliocaval vein pathologies. The ideal design(s) for venous stents remain unknown, although it is hoped that the presence of new dedicated venous stents in clinical practice will allow the generation of experience and data to advance our understanding in this area.

Digital subtraction angiography is the standard post revascularisation diagnostic tool to locate lesions and to evaluate the effect of an intervention. However, interpretation of digital subtraction angiography images is subjective and it is difficult to determine whether revascularisation has been sufficient for clinical improvement. A new technique is 2D perfusion angiography, which creates a 2D colour map and time density curve from the digital subtraction angiography scan for an objective evaluation of the results. However, its clinical relevance is unknown. The aim is to evaluate the association between 2D perfusion angiography parameters and clinical outcome after peripheral arterial interventions. Methods In this retrospective study, post revascularisation angiographic data and clinical data were reviewed of patients who underwent treatment of femoral-popliteal or femoral-tibial arteries. The outcome was assessed at three time points using three classification systems for peripheral arterial disease: Fontaine classification, American Medical Association whole person impairment classification (AMA) and average wound, ischemia, foot infection score. Post revascularisation angiographic data consisted of time density curves of the foot and lower leg which were extracted from the Syngo iFlow system (Siemens Healthineers). For each time density curve, five descriptive parameters were calculated: time of arrival, time to peak, mean transit time, wash-in rate and area under the curve. The association between the time density curve parameters and peripheral arterial disease classification systems was assessed using a regression analysis. Results Between July 2016 and December 2018, 103 patients underwent peripheral endovascular interventions in the hybrid operating room; 39 patients were suitable for analysis, of which 28 patients underwent digital subtraction angiography of the lower leg, 3 patients underwent digital subtraction angiography of the foot and 8 patients underwent digital subtraction angiography of both regions. Limited significant relations were found for time of arrival with Fontainde classification (B = 0.806, p = 0.043) and area under the curve with AMA classification (B = -0.027, p = 0.047). Conclusion In this retrospective study, time density curve parameters (time of arrival and area under the curve), measured in the lower leg, showed a limited significant association with two classification systems for peripheral arterial disease. Future prospective studies to determine the clinical relevance of this 2D perfusion angiography method should focus on standardisation of angiography protocols and comparison of pre- and post-intervention parameters.

It is important to accurately analyze the available evidence to provide correct clinical guidance for optimal patient care. We aim to discuss current clinical evidence regarding chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, remdesivir, and the cardiovascular burden of COVID-19. Methods A literature review was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar. Additional clinical trials were identified through the "TrialsTracker" project. Results We found conflicting evidence of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and remdesivir in COVID-19 despite promising early reports of in vitro antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Some of the current studies have demonstrated adverse drug reactions to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin. Widespread systemic inflammation and procoagulant/hypercoagulable state, including thrombotic microangiopathy, endothelial dysfunction, bleeding disorder, and thrombosis are increasingly being witnessed in COVID-19. Evidence of cardiac injury and stroke is mostly reported in hospitalized patients; however, large specialized studies that focus on cardiac or neuropathology are lacking. Discussion There is no convincing clinical evidence of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, and remdesivir use in COVID-19. As evidence of systemic inflammation is rapidly unfolding, there is a dire need to maximize our resources to find the best possible solutions to the current crisis while conclusive evidence from clinical trials emerges.

J	Nazir, S; Elzanaty, AM; Moukarbel, GV				Nazir, Salik; Elzanaty, Ahmed M.; Moukarbel, George, V			A simplified technique for converting antegrade femoral access to retrograde access for catheterization	VASCULAR			English	Article						Femoral access; antegrade to retrograde access; coronary angiography		Objectives Femoral access conversion is sometimes required in clinical practice. Various techniques have been reported to convert a retrograde femoral access to antegrade access with a high success rate. However, despite paucity of data, converting an antegrade access to retrograde access is quite challenging with a potentially higher risk of technical failure or loss of access. Methods Here, we report a simple technique of antegrade to retrograde access conversion utilizing a pigtail catheter and an angled Glidewire. Results Successful conversion was achieved with no immediate complications with the proposed technique. Conclusions Techniques that describe antegrade to retrograde access conversion are seldomly reported in the medical literature. Our technique was successful in making the conversion utilizing only pigtail catheter and angled Glidewire.

J	Gu, LS; Liu, XM; Wu, SL; Chu, KY; Bao, JJ				Gu, Lishuang; Liu, Xuemei; Wu, Shouling; Chu, Kaiyun; Bao, Jing-jing			A cross-sectional study on the tea consumption effects of ankle-brachial index	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Tea consumption; ankle-brachial index; cross-sectional survey; atherosclerosis; physical examination; vascular	INCIDENT CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS; PERIPHERAL ARTERY-DISEASE; GREEN TEA; ATHEROSCLEROSIS RISK; STATIN THERAPY; BLOOD-PRESSURE; FLAVONOIDS; COHORT; INDIVIDUALS; PREVALENCE	Objectives This thesis aims to explore the relationship between tea consumption and ankle-brachial index (ABI) and further studies the relationship between tea consumption and lower extremity atherosclerosis. Methods This is a cross-sectional, epidemiological survey of 17,373 subjects selected from the staff of Kailuan Group who had come to Kailuan General Hospital for a health examination from January 2016 to December 2017. Tea consumption was obtained by questionnaires. ABI was measured using an automated analyzer. The other data, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and so on, was collected on the same day of the health examination results. The relationship between tea drinking habits and ABI was studied using logistic regression and multivariate linear regression analysis. Results Among the 17,373 analyzed subjects, the difference in age, gender, BMI, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), uric acid (UA), C-reactive protein (CRP), fasting blood-glucose (Fbg), and ABI was statistically significant in the tea-drinking group and the nontea-drinking group (p < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression models revealed that tea consumption was a positive predictor for ABI (odds ratio (OR) = 0.782, confidence interval (CI), 0.615-0.994) (p < 0.05). Multivariate linear regression analysis of the ABI value showed that frequent tea-drinking has a positive correlation with the ABI value (p < 0.05). Conclusions The higher tea consumption is significantly associated with higher ABI which means less risk for lower extremity atherosclerosis.

J	Abreu, JAD; de Oliveira, RA; Martin, AA				de Carvalho Abreu, Jesus Antonio; de Oliveira, Rauirys Alencar; Martin, Airton Abrahao			Correlation between ankle-brachial index and thermography measurements in patients with peripheral arterial disease	VASCULAR			English	Article						Ankle-brachial index; thermography; peripheral artery disease		Objectives To correlate the ankle-brachial index and photographic thermography findings in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Methods Photographic thermography was performed at the foot level, and ankle-brachial index was measured in 72 lower limbs of 53 patients with peripheral arterial disease who were divided into calcified artery, patients with an ankle-brachial index greater than 1.4; and non-calcified artery classified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe on the basis of peripheral arterial disease severity. Fisher's exact test was used for categorical data, and Wilcoxon test was used for numerical data. Results Spearman's correlation analysis showed a strong correlation (R = 0.7) between the ankle-brachial index and the mean plantar temperature in patients without lower limb artery calcification. Linear regression yielded the predictor equation Y = 3.296 x X + 29.75, wherein ankle-brachial index (X) can be predicted on the basis of temperature values. Spearman's correlation test showed no significance (p = 0.2174) in patients with arterial calcification. Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc analysis using Dunn's test for multiple comparisons showed that the mean plantar temperature was lower in patients with arterial calcification. Conclusion Photographic thermography findings show a strong correlation with ankle-brachial index in patients with non-calcified arteries.

Aims The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictive efficacy of fibrinogen, lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein by retrospective analysis of fibrinogen, lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein levels in patients with vascular calcification, to explore the effective predictive indexes of vascular calcification, to predict the occurrence and development of vascular calcification, and to provide a simple and effective method for the diagnosis and prevention of vascular calcification. Hypothesis: Fibrinogen is a good prediction of vascular calcification. Methods Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the effects of fibrinogen, lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein on the CV, and the ROC curve of the predictive model was used to assess its predictive effectiveness. We collected the relevant indicators of 462 patients admitted to the Department of Vascular Surgery of the First Hospital of Hebei Medical University from August 2018 to July 2020, including 189 patients with vascular calcification (40.9%) and 273 patients without vascular calcification (59.1%); 75% of the collected data is used for modeling (modeling group) and 25% for verification (verification group). Results Results from the multivariate analysis showed fibrinogen, lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein to be independent predictors of vascular calcification. Next, the three-factor models are developed respectively. The area below the ROC curve in the fibrinogen, lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein forecast model was 0.8018, 0.7348, and 0.7019, respectively. Conclusions Fibrinogen is more predictive than high-density lipoprotein and lipoprotein in patients with arteriosclerosis.

In these cases, it is customary to resort to sophisticated techniques such as parallel or fenestrated grafts. In very selected cases, such as symptomatic wide neck aneurysm or patient with limited life expectancy, Funnel Technique may find an indication. Methods It consists in placing a bifurcated endograft in the abdominal aorta embricated with a thoracic endograft as a proximal cuff in an infrarenal position. Results In the literature review, we found 32 cases of this technique, whose characteristics are collected in a table. Conclusion The Funnel Technique, taking advantage of the larger diameters of the thoracic prostheses, may easily treat abdominal aortic aneurysm cases with a wide neck.

We compared the midterm outcomes of drug-coated balloon angioplasty versus plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) for femoropopliteal chronic total occlusions. Methods In total, 95 patients from the AcoArt I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01850056) with >= 5-cm femoropopliteal chronic total occlusion lesions were enrolled in this post-hoc subset analysis (drug-coated balloon,n = 50; POBA,n = 45). The primary endpoints were primary patency and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) at 24 months. The secondary endpoints were late lumen loss at six months and binary restenosis, major adverse events (composite of death and target limb amputation), change in the Rutherford class, and the ankle-brachial index at 24 months. Results Demographic, clinical, and lesion characteristics were matched (mean lesion length, 20 cm). The six-month late-lumen loss rate was lower in the drug-coated balloon than POBA group (0.18 +/- 0.81 vs. 1.34 +/- 0.94 mm, respectively;P < 0.001). The 24-month primary patency rate was significantly higher in the drug-coated balloon than POBA group (53.85% vs. 17.50%, respectively;P < 0.001). The CD-TLR rate in the drug-coated balloon and POBA groups was 12.77 and 45.24%, respectively (P = 0.002). The 24-month overall mortality rate in the drug-coated balloon and POBA groups was 12.77% and 6.98%, respectively (P = 0.360), with no device- or procedure-related deaths. One major amputation had occurred in each group by the 24-month follow-up. Conclusion The paclitaxel drug-coated balloon shows better primary patency and freedom from target lesion revascularization than POBA at 24 months after treatment of femoropopliteal chronic total occlusions (>= 5 cm) lesion.

Intravenous ketorolac is associated with reduced mortality and morbidity after open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair	VASCULAR			English	Article						Abdominal aortic aneurysm; endovascular repair; ketorolac; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; open repair	NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS; ANALGESIC EFFICACY; INDOMETHACIN; INHIBITION; MORPHINE; SURGERY; COX-2; INFLAMMATION; EXPANSION	Objectives The role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aortic aneurysm disease has been debated. Animal studies demonstrated that intrathecal ketorolac reduces the inflammatory response associated with aortic clamping. However, no human-subject study evaluated this association. Therefore, we sought to explore the effects of ketorolac use in open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Methods The Premier Healthcare Database (June 2009-March 2015) was inquired to capture patients who underwent open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair for non-ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, identified via International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Intravenous ketorolac was coded as any or none. Outcomes were in-hospital mortality, cardiac, respiratory, renal, neurological, and hemorrhagic complications. Multivariable logistic regression coarsened exact matching followed by conditional fixed-effect regression modeling were performed. Results A total of 6394 patients were identified (ketorolac: 806; 12.6%). Patients who received ketorolac were younger and less likely to have hypertension (76.1% vs. 79.3%), diabetes mellitus (12.5% vs. 17.4%), or chronic kidney disease (8.3% vs. 21.4%; allpvalues <= .033). There was no significant difference in medication use including oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and malignant or musculoskeletal diseases. Mortality, respiratory, and renal complications were less prevalent with ketorolac (2.5% vs. 4.9%, 25.2% vs. 34.6%, 10.0% vs. 21.1%;p <= .002). Ketorolac was associated with lower adjusted odds for those events: 0.58 (0.36-0.93), 0.53 (0.42-0.68), and 0.72 (0.60-0.86), respectively (allpvalues <= .025). There was no association with neurological, cardiac, or hemorrhagic complications. The findings were replicated by coarsened exact matching analysis. Conclusion This study demonstrated 40% mortality reduction with intravenous ketorolac following open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The survival benefit could be due to its anti-inflammatory and opioid-sparing properties. This is evident by its protective effect against respiratory outcomes. The lack of association with the classical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-related cardiac and hemorrhagic complication could be attributable to the short-term use of ketorolac compared with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs chronic use.

Studies found that folic acid (FA) supplementation can reduce the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential mechanisms of FA attenuating HHcy-related arterial injury in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Methods: 24 SHRs were randomized into the control group, the HHcy group, and the HHcy + FA group (8 per group). The SHRs in the HHcy group and the HHcy + FA group were given DL-Hcy intraperitoneally to mimic hypertension associated with HHcy. The SHRs in the HHcy + FA group were given FA by gavage to mimic an FA-fortified diet. The histopathology and immunohistochemistry of rat aorta and carotid artery were analyzed, and the relative expression levels of immune/inflammation and oxidative stress molecules in arterial tissue were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. Results: FA significantly reduced the expression levels of nuclear factor-kappa-gene binding (NF-kappa B) p65/Rela and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in rat arterial tissues, as well as the levels of plasma HHcy and serum malondialdehyde (MDA) in hypertension associated with HHcy rats (p < 0.05). At the same time, FA significantly increased the serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) level in hypertension associated with HHcy rats, and even the SOD level of the HHcy + FA group was higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05). However, HHcy induced the opposite results of the above indicators in SHRs compared with the control group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The arterial protection mechanisms of FA are related to reducing the concentration of HHcy to eliminate the tissue toxicity of HHcy, inhibiting NF-kappa Bp65/Rela/IL-6 pathway molecules to regulate inflammatory response, and promoting the potential anti-oxidative stress pathway molecules to reduce oxidative stress level.

Near-infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green for quantification of changes in tissue perfusion following revascularization	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						peripheral artery disease; lower extremity arterial disease; near-infrared fluorescence; indocyanine green; revascularization; perfusion	PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL-DISEASE; QUANTITATIVE-EVALUATION; ANGIOGRAPHY; DIAGNOSIS	Objectives Current diagnostic modalities for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) mainly focus on the macrovascular level. For assessment of tissue perfusion, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) seems promising. In this prospective cohort study, ICG NIR fluorescence imaging was performed pre- and post-revascularization to assess changes in foot perfusion. Methods ICG NIR fluorescence imaging was performed in 36 patients with PAD pre- and post-intervention. After intravenous bolus injection of 0.1 mg/kg ICG, the camera registered the NIR fluorescence intensity over time on the dorsum of the feet for 15 min using the Quest Spectrum Platform (R). Time-intensity curves were plotted for three regions of interest (ROI): (1) the dorsum of the foot, (2) the forefoot, and (3) the hallux. Time-intensity curves were normalized for maximum fluorescence intensity. Extracted parameters were the maximum slope, area under the curve (AUC) for the ingress, and the AUC for the egress. The non-treated contralateral leg was used as a control group. Results Successful revascularization was performed in 32 patients. There was a significant increase for the maximum slope and AUC egress in all three ROIs. The most significant difference was seen for the maximum slope in ROI 3 (3.7%/s to 6.6%/s, p < 0.001). In the control group, no significant differences were seen for the maximum slope and AUC egress in all ROIs. Conclusions This study shows the potential of ICG NIR fluorescence imaging in assessing the effect of revascularization procedures on foot perfusion. Future studies should focus on the use of this technique in predicting favorable outcome of revascularization procedures.

Methods One hundred ninety-five (n = 195) subjects who were treated for venous leg ulcers were enrolled between 2009 and 2014. Three groups were formed (Group A: high saphenous ligation and total stripping, Group B: radiofrequency ablation of the great saphenous vein + perforators, and Group C: radiofrequency ablation of the great saphenous vein + subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery) (n = 65 for each group). The venous clinical severity score for baseline, 1st, 6th, and 12th months, great saphenous vein occlusion at the 1st, 6th, and 12th months, and ulcer rates for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th years were recorded. Results For venous clinical severity score, only the first month decrease was significant for the subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery group (p = 0.001). Great saphenous vein occlusion was higher at the 6th and 12th months for the high saphenous ligation and stripping and subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery groups than for the radiofrequency ablation group (p = 0.036 and p = 0.037). The rate of ulcers for the subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery group was lower at the second, third, fourth, and fifth years (p = 0.011). No significant difference was found between groups for the five-year recovery rates (p > 0.05). Conclusion Subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery technique in conjunction with radiofrequency ablation of axial vein was superior to both high saphenous ligation and stripping and radiofrequency ablation of axial and perforators for ulcer healing.

Methods The patient was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome causing symptomatic thrombosis of an aberrant right subclavian artery associated with diverticulum of Kommerell. The patient had history of extensive surgeries and radiation in the right chest with fibrotic changes, so surgical dissection in the area was associated with significant risk of nerve injury. Therefore, revascularization of the arm was performed via carotid to brachial artery bypass with reversed saphenous vein and the thoracic outlet was decompressed with segmental clavicular resection. Results Patient has been symptom free for 3 years with patent bypass. Conclusions This case demonstrates a unique presentation of distal thrombosis of a symptomatic aberrant right subclavian artery related to thoracic outlet syndrome. The combined claviculectomy-vein bypass is a safe and efficacious surgical approach that provides durable relief.

The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOAs) for the treatment of CAVTE. Materials and methods A network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing DOAs (Apixaban, Rivaroxaban, and Edoxaban) versus Dalteparin for the treatment of CAVTE was performed. Outcomes of interest included, VTE recurrence, all-cause mortality, event-free survival, major bleeding, and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB). Analysis was based on a random effects model and Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo method was used for indirect comparisons. Results Four RCTs involving 2894 patients were included. Overall certainty of evidence was moderate regarding all outcomes. DOAs exhibited lower risk of VTE (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.44, 0.87; P = 0.007), similar risk of major bleeding (RR 1.33; 95% CI 0.84, 2.11; P = 0.23), and higher risk of CRNMB (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.08, 2.56; P = 0.02), compared with Dalteparin. Risk of all-cause mortality and event-free survival were similar between groups with RR 0.99 (95% CI 0.84, 1.16) and RR 1.03 (95% CI 0.94, 1.13), respectively. Apixaban ranked first for recurrent VTE (42.4%) and major bleeding (62.3%) and Dalteparin ranked first for CRNMB (54.7%). Rivaroxaban ranked best considering all-cause mortality (58.7%); Apixaban ranked best for event-free survival (83.6%). Conclusions DOAs presented a reduced risk of recurrent VTE with similar risk of major bleeding compared to Dalteparin. However, a higher risk of CRNMB is expected when this cohort of patients are treated with DOAs instead of Dalteparin.

Shane			Saccular mycotic aneurysm of descending thoracic aorta secondary to vertebral hydatid disease: A rare case	VASCULAR			English	Article						Thoracic aortic aneurysm; descending aorta; hydatid cyst; saccular		Background/Objective Hydatid disease of the aorta is very rare. Hydatid disease can result in saccular aneurysm of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Case report We report a rare case of saccular aneurysm of the distal descending thoracic aorta. The diameter of the aneurysm was 60 mm. It was managed by Thoracic Endovascular Aneurysm Repair. After 41 months, computed tomography angiography revealed a multi-loculated cystic lesion with 86 x 83x80 mm dimensions in the prevertebral area at the T10-T11 level with bony destruction and erosion of the anterior margin of the vertebral bodies. A computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration of the paravertebral cystic lesion was performed. Microscopic study of the fine-needle aspiration specimen demonstrated Echinococcosis granulosus diagnostic of hydatid disease. Conclusion It is concluded that the case was a mycotic aneurysm of the thoracic aorta secondary to vertebral hydatid disease.

Methods In this retrospective study, consecutive patients with symptomatic SICAD from two institutions were included. The demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, imaging findings and treatment strategy selection were obtained from the medical records. The general epidemiological data, treatment regimens and clinical and follow-up outcomes were analysed. Results Patients were divided into the conservative treatment group (group A, n = 26) and endovascular treatment group (group B, n = 11). Of these 37 patients, extent of dissection in both groups included only celiac trunk (61.54%% vs. 18.18%, p = 0.03), common hepatic artery (CHA) and splenic artery (SA) (3.85%% vs. 54.55%, p = 0.001), CHA (7.69% vs. 18.18%, p = 0.57), SA (23.08% vs. 9.09, p = 0.65) and left gastric artery (LGA) (3.85% vs. 54.55%, p = 0.99). Of note, the extension of the lesion in group A was shorter than that in group B. In addition, there were significantly more type IIb in group A than in group B (42.31% vs. 9.09%, p = 0.06) and the mean length of dissection in group A was 42.3 +/- 54.71 mm which was significantly shorter than that in the group B 58.45 +/- 3.71 mm (p =0.04). During a median follow-up of 11.5 months, the 1, 3, 6 and 12 month follow-ups were completed in 100% (37/37), 100% (37/37), 94.59% (35/37) and 91.19% (34/37) of patients, respectively. The cumulative rate of persistent disease stability in patients with endovascular treatment group was higher than in that conservative treatment group at the 3, 6, 9 and 12 months (50% vs. 16.67%, p = 0.001; 80% vs. 37.5%, p =0.03; 100% vs. 62.5%, p = 0.012;100% vs. 91.67%, p = 0.02 respectively). Conclusion Most symptomatic SICAD have a tendency to persistent disease stability after conservative treatment. Risk factors for failed conservative treatment were length of dissection and branch involvement. Furthermore, endovascular treatment was associated with a high technical success and persistent disease stability rate, which might be reserved for patients with failed conservative treatment.

Methods Retrospective analysis of outcomes from all patients who underwent surgical profundoplasty in a single tertiary referral centre was performed. Patients who presented with either rest pain or tissue loss and had combined profunda femoral artery disease and superficial femoral artery occlusion were included in the study. Outcomes were compared between the rest pain and the tissue loss groups. Results Between 2009 and 2019, 51 procedures were performed in 49 patients; 27 (53%) procedures were performed for rest pain and 24 (47%) for tissue loss. Technical success was 100% in both groups. Procedure success was significantly better in the rest pain group owing to lower procedure-related complications (p = 0.037). Incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events was higher in the tissue loss group with five reported cases compared to only one in the rest pain group (p = .05); 85.2% of patients with rest pain experienced clinical improvement compared to only 33.3% in the tissue loss group (p < .001). Higher rates of re-intervention were recorded in the tissue loss group, but this was not statistically significant. Amputation-free survival at 3, 6 and 12 months was 96%, 96% and 92% in the rest pain group, respectively, compared to 77%, 67% and 54% in the tissue loss group (p = .004). At one-year, freedom from major adverse limb events was lower in patients with tissue loss at 43% compared to 81% in patients with rest pain (p = .009). Conclusions Profundoplasty performed as a sole procedure for revascularisation of the critically ischaemic limb is a viable straightforward option. However, our results suggest that it may be more effective in the treatment of rest pain rather than in the setting of tissue loss when a combined superficial femoral artery angioplasty or distal bypass may be required.

Methods We report a rare case of symptomatic superior mesenteric artery aneurysm. A 78-year-old man presents with pain and pulsating mass in the right umbilical region of the abdomen. The patient was treated by percutaneous ultrasound-guided Onyx injection after several failing transarterial embolization attempts. Results The procedure was successful without any complication, and the patient wasdischarged to home the day after procedure. Follow-up at 60 months confirmed the complete thrombosis of the aneurysm sac. Ultrasound-guided Onyx injection for distal superior mesenteric artery aneurysm could provide an alternative to transcatheter arterial embolization or open surgery. Anatomical assessment of collaterals and knowledge of abdomen anatomy could play important roles in preventing bowel ischemia and minimizing the risk of procedural complication. Conclusion Ultrasound-guided Onyx injection of superior mesenteric artery aneurysm is a feasible, effective, and cost-saving technique that can be used when endovascular approach is not possible or has failed.

The modified frailty index-11 predicts medium-term outcomes after endovascular revascularisation for chronic limb threatening ischaemia in Asian patients	VASCULAR			English	Article						Angioplasty; peripheral arterial disease; CLTI; frailty; endovascular; revascularisation		Objective The aim was to evaluate the utility of frailty, as defined by the modified Frailty Index-1 1 (mFI-11) on predicting outcomes following endovascular revascularisation in Asian patients with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI). Methods CLTI patients who underwent endovascular revascularisation between January 2015 and March 2017 were included. Patients were retrospectively scored using the mFI-11 to categorise frailty as low, medium or high risk. Observed outcomes included 30-day complication rate and unplanned readmissions, 1-, 6- and 12-month mortality, and ambulation status at 6- and 12 months post-intervention. Results A total of 233 patients (250 procedures) were included; 137 (58.8%) were males and the mean age was 69.0 (+/- 10.7) years. 202/233 (86.7%) were diabetic and 196/233 (84.1%) had a prior diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The mean mFI-11 score was 4.2 (+/- 1.5). 28/233 (12.0%), 155/233 (66.5%), and 50/233 (21.5%) patients were deemed low (mF-11 score 0-2), moderate (mFI-11 score 3-5) and high (mFI-11 score 5-7) frailty risk, respectively. High frailty was associated with an increased 12-month mortality (OR 8.54, 95% CI 1.05-69.5; p = 0.05), 30-day complication rate (OR 9.41, 95% CI 2.01-44.1; p < 0.01) and 30-day unplanned readmission (OR 5.06, 95% CI 1.06-24.2; p = 0.04). Furthermore, a high score was associated with a significantly worse 6- (OR 0.320, 95% CI 0.120-0.840; p = 0.02) and 12-month (OR 0.270, 95% CI 0.100-0.710; p < 0.01) ambulatory status. Conclusion The mFI-11 is a useful, non-invasive tool that can be readily calculated using readily available patient data, for prediction of medium-term outcomes for Asian CLTI patients following endovascular revascularisation. Early recognition of short- and mid-term loss of ambulation status amongst high-frailty patients in this challenging cohort of patients could aid decision-making for whether a revascularisation or amputation-first policy is appropriate, and manage patient and caregiver expectations on potential improvement in functional outcome.

Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed and reported following the requirement of the PRISMA. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane library were queried from January 2000 to June 2020 to identify eligible literature. The modified Downs and Black checklist was used to assess the quality of included studies. Outcome measures included bail-out stenting, distal embolization, perforation, hematoma, primary patency at 12 months, target lesion revascularization at 12 months, leg amputation at 12 months, and mortality at 12 months. We used DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model to pool the dichotomous data on risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study to obtain an overall estimate for major outcomes. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results Six studies (two randomized controlled trials and four retrospective cohort studies) with 470 patients were included. Atherectomy plus drug-coated balloon group was associated with lower rates of bail-out stenting (RR: 0.49, 95%CI: 0.34-0.71, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between two groups in terms of distal embolization (RR: 2.06, 95%CI: 0.51-8.38, P = 0.31), perforation (RR: 2.04, 95%CI: 0.43-9.71, P = 0.37), hematoma (RR: 1.75, 95%CI: 0.43-7.09, P = 0.43), primary patency at 12 months (1.09, 95%CI: 0.98-1.21, P = 0.12), target lesion revascularization at 12 months (RR: 0.68, 95%CI: 0.41-1.14, P = 0.15), leg amputations at 12 months (RR: 0.54, 95%CI: 0.13-2.23, P = 0.39), mortality at 12 months (RR: 2.18, 95%CI: 0.71-6.64, P = 0.17). Sensitivity analysis had no effect on our findings. Conclusions The combination of atherectomy and drug-coated balloon was safe and effective in the treatment of femoropopliteal artery lesions, with lower incidence of bail-out stenting compared with drug-coated balloon only.

J	Hannsberger, D; Heinola, I; di Summa, PG; Sorelius, K				Hannsberger, Daniel; Heinola, Ivika; di Summa, Pietro Giovanni; Sorelius, Karl			The value of 18F-FDG-PET-CT in the management of infective native aortic aneurysms	VASCULAR			English	Review						Infective native aortic aneurysm; 18F-FDG-PET-CT; positron emission tomography; PET-CT; mycotic aneurysm	PET/CT; DIAGNOSIS	Objective The objective of this systematic literature review was to explore the value of positron emission tomography combined with low-dose computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET-CT) in the diagnostics of infective native aortic aneurysm (INAA). Methods A systematic literature review was performed using the search terms mycotic- and infected aortic aneurysms in Medline and Sciencedirect databases, published between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2020. Using the PRISMA statement, articles were scrutinized according to a predefined protocol including: timing of 18F-FDG-PET-CT examination, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), additional findings on examination, and findings on repeated scanning of 18F-FDG-PET-CT. Results Four studies were included in the analysis, comprising a total of 11 patients. Two studies were single case reports, and two were small case series, all were graded to be of low quality with high risk of bias. All patients were examined with a preoperative 18F-FDG-PET-CT, and 10 (91%) had increased 18F-FDG uptakes. The median SUVmax value was 6.53, range 4.46-9.23. The mean duration of antibiotic therapy prior to 18F-FDG-PET-CT was not known. Two patients were examined with repeated 18F-FDG-PET-CT examinations after treatment, where a decrease in SUVmax values could be demonstrated after successful treatment. Conclusion The literature on 18F-FDF-PET/CT for diagnosing infective native aortic aneurysms is scarce. However, there might be a role for 18F-FDF-PET/CT in the management of the disease, in particular for patients with clinical suspicion of INAA without convincing findings on CT. SUVmax values ranging from 4.5 to 6.5 could be guiding and suggestive of metabolic activity in agreement of INAA. However, further conclusions on its usefulness, robustness and specific SUVmax values are premature, and a definitive cut-off value is probably not attainable.

This prospective cohort study aimed to examine the prognostic value of myeloperoxidase in patients with peripheral artery disease in relation to major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), target lesion revascularisation, and major adverse limb events (MALEs) and its association with multi-bed vascular disease, which is defined as any combination of the following: peripheral artery disease and coronary artery disease. Methods Myeloperoxidase levels were measured in patients with peripheral artery disease and coronary artery disease during angiography. A total of 94 patients were analysed and followed up regarding their MACEs, target lesion revascularisation, and MALEs from August 2016 until February 2019. Results Among patients with peripheral artery disease, the rates of MACE and mortality were higher in patients with high myeloperoxidase levels than in those with low myeloperoxidase levels; the myeloperoxidase levels were 3.68 times higher in these patients (p < 0.0001). Patients with peripheral artery disease and coronary artery disease (multi-bed vascular disease) had higher myeloperoxidase levels than those with only peripheral artery disease and only coronary artery disease (one-bed vascular disease). Peripheral artery disease patients with higher myeloperoxidase levels had significantly higher rates of limb ischaemia, requiring further revascularisation than those with low myeloperoxidase levels. Conclusions High myeloperoxidase levels suggest poor outcomes and are associated with MACE and limb ischaemia.

Traditionally, very elderly patients have been considered too frail to undergo major vascular interventions. Considering that abdominal aortic aneurysm is an age-related disease, there is an increasing need of a correct management of the disease even in nonagenarians, but data are still scarce. The purpose of this single-centre study is to report early and mid-term outcomes of all-comer abdominal aortic aneurysm patients in their 10th decades of age. Methods A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained database identified a total of 33 patients aged >= 90 presenting with abdominal aortic aneurysm between 2014 and 2019. Elective and emergency repairs were both considered. Early technical success and mortality rate at 30 days were considered as primary outcomes. Mid-term clinical success was reported, and overall survival, freedom from aneurysm-related death, re-interventions and endoleaks were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, stratified for elective of emergency repair and type of treatment. Results The mean age was 91.7 (range 90-96), and 63.6% were male. Mean abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter was 67.4 +/- 16.8 mm. Sixteen patients were admitted for rupture abdominal aortic aneurysm: three untreated, five underwent open and seven underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), with an early mortality rate of 100, 100 and 42.8%, respectively. Eighteen (60%) patients were asymptomatic, and all underwent elective EVAR, with an early mortality rate of 0%. At one-month follow-up, clinical success was 84% in EVAR group. At a median follow-up of 22.4 +/- 14.5 months, no abdominal aortic aneurysm-related death was registered. Freedom from all cause of mortality was 77.3, 59.4 and 40.7% at one, two and three years. Freedom from endoleaks was 95.4% at one month and 61.7% at one and three years. Freedom from reintervention was 85.8% at three years. Conclusion Elective EVAR in nonagenarians is associated with acceptable early and mid-term outcomes. Age by itself should not be considered an exclusion criterion for treatment.

Methods Charts of ten patients with atherosclerotic carotid stenosis that were treated using the neobulb technique between 2002 and 2019 were reviewed. Results No major surgical adverse event was observed in the postoperative assessments. No postoperative common or internal carotid stenosis was observed in the mid- or long-term follow-up. Conclusions The neobulb technique allows carotid endarterectomy closure without a synthetic or venous patch, using the external carotid artery as an autologous patch, while preserving distal flow into the external carotid artery branches.

This study aimed to detect the expression level of miR-451a and investigate the diagnostic and prognostic values of miR-451a for AS patients. Methods The relative expression of miR-451a was assessed by qRT-PCR. Comparison of groups was analyzed with the t-test and chi-squared test. Pearson analysis was used to validate the correlation of miR-451 with CRP and CIMT. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, K-M analysis, and Cox regression analysis were conducted to explore the roles of miR-451a in diagnosing AS patients and predicting outcomes of AS patients. Results The expression of miR-451a was significantly decreased in the serum of AS patients. The results of Pearson analysis showed the expression of miR-451a was negatively correlated with CRP and CIMT. The data of ROC proposed miR-451a could differentiate AS patients from healthy individuals with high sensitivity and specificity. K-M analysis and Cox regression showed miR-451a might be an independent biomarker of suffering cardiovascular endpoint diseases in AS patients. The expression of miR-451a was obviously inhibited in AS patients with cardiovascular endpoint events. Conclusion Deregulation of miR-451a might be associated with the development of AS. MiR-451a might be used as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for clinical treatment of AS patients.

The overall effective rate of PTA was 63.6%, including cured 39.4% and improved 24.2%, at the end of follow-up. Overall clinical outcomes were not statistically different between the TA and non-TA groups (p = 0.316), nor were cure rates (p = 0.072). 15 patients received reintervention due to restenosis after the first successful PTA; the interval was 2-56 months (median: 12 months). Four patients received reintervention due to a failed PTA. A total of four patients received open surgery. Binary logistics regression analysis showed that stenosis length and residual stenosis rate were strongly correlated with effective PTA (p = 0.045, p = 0.044). Conclusions As a primary treatment for pediatric RVH, PTA can achieve satisfactory results, which are influenced by lesion length and residual stenosis rate.

Outcomes of endovascular treatment of patients with intermittent claudication due to femoropopliteal disease	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						claudication; endovascular; revascularization; outcomes	PERIPHERAL ARTERY-DISEASE; SUPERVISED EXERCISE; PRACTICE GUIDELINES; THERAPY; MANAGEMENT; SOCIETY; SURGERY; INTERVENTIONS; PROGRAMS; RISK	Objective Our objective was to evaluate the outcomes of endovascular treatment in patients with moderate and severe claudication due to femoropopliteal disease, that is, disease of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. Methods A retrospective review of all patients with moderate and severe claudication (Rutherford 2 and 3) undergoing endovascular treatment for FP disease between January 2012 and December 2017 at two university-affiliated hospitals was performed. All procedures were performed by vascular surgeons. Primary outcomes were mortality, freedom from reintervention, major adverse limb events defined as major amputations, open surgical revascularization, or progression to chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) at 30 days, 1 year, 2 years, and last follow-up. Unadjusted odds ratios were calculated to identify variables associated with adverse outcomes, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to determine mortality and freedom from reintervention. Results Eighty-five limbs in 74 patients were identified on review. Mean age was 69.6 +/- 9.8 years and 74.3% were males. At a median follow-up of 49.0 +/- 25.5 months, all-cause mortality rate was 8.1% (6 patients) with 16.7% being due to cardiovascular causes. Reintervention rates were 1.2%, 16.5%, and 21.2% at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. Major adverse limb events occurred in 3 patients and rates were 0%, 1.2%, and 2.4% at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. Progression to CLTI was 0%, 1.2%, and 1.2% at 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. Claudication had improved or resolved in 55.6% (n = 34 patients), stable in 38.9% (n = 21 patients), and worse in 5.6% (n = 3 patients) Age >= 70 years (OR = 4.09 (1.14-14.66), p = 0.027), TASCII A lesion (OR = 4.67 (1.14-19.17), p = 0.025), and presence of 3-vessel runoff (OR = 3.70 (1.18-11.59), p = 0.022) predicted symptoms' improvement. TASCII A lesions were less likely to require reintervention (OR = 0.23 (0.06-0.86), p = 0.020). Reintervention within 1 year (OR = 11.67 (0.98-138.94), p = 0.017), reintervention with a stent (OR = 14.40 (1.19-173.67), p = 0.008) and more than one reintervention (OR = 39.00 (2.89-526.28), p < 0.001) predicted major adverse limb events. Conclusions Careful patient selection is important when planning endovascular treatment in patients with intermittent claudication and FP disease. This could result in symptomatic improvement in more than half of the patients. Adverse outcomes such as major adverse limb events, progression to CLTI, and amputations occur at low rates.

To adequately characterize and validate the effectiveness of vascular interventions, in vivo experimentation in large animals is required. Thus, it is necessary to find a method to detect the shape and density of blood vessels in the lower extremities that can evaluate and verify the treatment measures' effectiveness and have high accuracy and repeatability. This study characterized factors that determined both the accuracy and overall value of digital subtraction angiography in lower limb arteriography using a canine animal model. Methods Six beagle dogs were anesthetized and immobilized on the motorized table. The femoral artery was accessed using an indwelling needle. A bolus of contrast agent was injected into the access site, and digital subtraction angiography with bolus chase technology was used to collect contrast images for analysis. At the end of the procedure, the anesthetized dogs were euthanized using an overdose of potassium chloride. After confirming the euthanasia of the dogs, the cadavers were taken to the experimental animal center of Xinjiang Medical University and processed by qualified institutional personnel. Results The final arteriographic images of the hind limbs from all six dogs were precise, and the branches of small vessels could be distinguished without any visible artifacts. Conclusions These results suggested that arteriography using digital subtraction angiography could reveal the shape and density of blood vessels in canine animal models. This method has great potential to significantly improve research related to limb ischemia due to its simple and reproducible results.

Popliteal entrapment syndrome-The case for a new classification	VASCULAR			English	Article						Entrapment syndrome; popliteal artery entrapment; popliteal compression; popliteal entrapment syndrome; popliteal vein entrapment		Objectives To assess the ability of the current classification system for popliteal entrapment syndrome to accurately capture all patients, and if not, to design an all-inclusive new classification. Methods Retrospective review of all interventions performed for popliteal entrapment syndrome between 1994 and 2013 at our institution was performed. Preoperative imaging and intraoperative findings were used to establish the compressive morphology of popliteal entrapment syndrome. Patients were categorized, when possible, into six types of the current classification system (Rich classification, modified by Levien) and into seven types of a new classification. Results Sixty-seven limbs of 49 patients were operated on for unilateral (31) or bilateral (18) popliteal entrapment syndrome. The current classification system captured the anatomy of only 43 (64%) of 67 limbs with popliteal entrapment syndrome. Compressive morphologies without a defined class included aberrant insertion of the lateral head of gastrocnemius muscle, muscle slip originating from the lateral head of gastrocnemius or hamstrings, hypertrophied hamstring muscle, abnormal fibrous bands, perivascular connective tissue, and prominent lateral femoral condyle. The new classification captured 100% of the limbs with popliteal entrapment syndrome. Conclusions Current classification of popliteal entrapment syndrome is inadequate as more than one-third of the cases reviewed fell outside of the standard classification system.

J	Pala, AA; Urcun, YS				Pala, Arda Aybars; Urcun, Yusuf Salim			Effect of calculated plasma osmolality and atherogenic index of plasma on carotid artery blood flow velocities	VASCULAR			English	Article						Atherogenic index of plasma; blood flow velocity; carotid artery disease; osmolality		Objectives The increase in carotid artery blood flow velocity is a measure of the severity of the carotid artery stenosis caused by atherosclerosis. Carotid artery stenosis is progressive and is of great importance due to the risk of stroke it creates. As an alternative to radiological examinations in these patients, patient follow-up can be facilitated by associating novel laboratory parameters with the severity of stenosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of the calculated plasma osmolality and atherogenic index of plasma on carotid artery blood flow velocities in patients with carotid artery stenosis. Methods A total of 161 patients diagnosed with carotid artery stenosis who admitted to our clinic between May 2018 and May 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the carotid artery blood flow velocities measured with the Doppler ultrasonography, the patients were divided into two groups as "Normal flow velocity group" (n = 62) and "Increased flow velocity group" (n = 99). Results The calculated plasma osmolality, atherogenic index of plasma, and mean platelet volume were significantly associated with increased carotid artery blood flow velocity (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.006; respectively). Calculated plasma osmolality and atherogenic index of plasma were identified as independent predictors of increase in carotid artery blood flow velocity (p < 0.001, p < 0.001; respectively). In the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, the plasma osmolality cut-off value, which predicts the increase in carotid artery blood flow velocity was found to be 291.45 mOsm/kg (Area Under the Curve: 0.746, p < 0.001, 65.7% sensitivity, and 67.7% specificity), and atherogenic index of plasma cut-off value was 0.20 (Area Under the Curve: 0.735, p < 0.001, 65.7% sensitivity, and 66.1% specificity). Conclusion There was a significant relationship between the increase in carotid artery blood flow velocity and the increase in plasma osmolality and atherogenic index of plasma values. As a result, we can predict the increase in carotid artery blood flow velocity, that is, the increase in the severity of the carotid artery stenosis, with plasma osmolality and atherogenic index of plasma values that can be calculated simply from routine biochemical tests.

Methods Between November 2016 and April 2018, 55 patients who were treated with rotational atherectomy and adjunctive balloon angioplasty due to complex femoropopliteal lesions were retrospectively scanned. Results Fifty-five patients who underwent endovascular treatment with rotational atherectomy for chronic total occlusive femoropopliteal lesions were included in the study. Technical success rate was 100%. The mean age was 63 (+/- 10.5) years. The cohort included 25 (45.4%) diabetics and 45 (81.8%) current smokers. The mean length of the lesions was 20.8 +/- 11.2 cm. Chronic total occlusive lesions were detected in 35 (63.6%) patients, and mixed-type steno-occlusive lesions were detected in 20 patients (36.4%). Thirty-three (60%) lesions were moderate or severely calcified. Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed with plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) on 31 (56.4%) patients and with drug-coated balloon angioplasty on 24 (43.6%) patients. After adjunctive balloon angioplasty, flow limiting dissection was observed in 20 (36.3%) patients, and 17 (30.9%) patients needed stent implantation. The Kaplan-Meier analysis method estimated that the overall primary patency rates at 12 and 24 months were 81.8% and 70.9%, respectively. Overall, secondary patency rates at 12 and 24 months were 94.5% and 80%. No statistically significant differences of 24-month primary patency and secondary patency rates were found between patients treated with drug-coated balloon angioplasty and POBA as an adjunctive therapy, even though primary patency (83.3% vs. 61.3%, p = .06) and secondary patency (91.7% vs. 71%, p = .56) rates of drug-coated balloon angioplasty were slightly higher than POBA. Patients with claudication had better primary patency (90.5% vs. 58.8%, p = .001) and secondary patency (100% vs. 67.6%, p = .004) rates than patients with critical limb ischemia at 24 months. Significant differences between patients who did and did not stop smoking were found in 24-month primary patency (57% vs. 88%, p = .007) and secondary patency (67% vs. 96%, p = .007). Six patients underwent unplanned amputation. There were eight (14.5%) mortalities during follow-up. Conclusions Rotational atherectomy with adjunctive balloon angioplasty has satisfactory technical success rates and mid-term outcomes. As an adjunctive method, there was no difference between drug-coated balloon angioplasty s and POBAs. Smoking cessation is always the first-step treatment to improve mid-term patency results. Patients with critical limb ischemia have worse patency results compared to the patients with claudication.

Methods A retrospective analysis of selected case series was performed. A trans-popliteal hybrid technique was carried out in seven limbs (six patients). Open exposure of above-the-knee popliteal artery was performed over its maximum calcification zone. After retrograde recanalization and graft-stenting of the entire superficial femoral artery, endarterectomy of the popliteal artery was performed for debulking and widening of the distal landing zone of the endoprosthesis. The latter is included in the bovine patch suture to avoid leaving a segment untreated. Results Technical success, haemodynamic and clinical improvement were achieved in all procedures. Median length of treated occlusion was 19.8 cm. After a mean follow-up of 12 months (range 6-26 months), the primary patency was 85.7% (only one asymptomatic occlusion occurred). There were no major cardiovascular or limb adverse events. No re-interventions were required. Conclusion This less-invasive, one-incision technique is safe and effective for the restoration of in-line flow from groin to ankle, currently recommended in CLTI revascularization. It could be especially useful in highly calcified popliteal artery lesions, hostile groins or those at high risk of infection and in cases of vein absence for bypass surgery.

It was hypothesized that laser speckle flowgraphy may be able to identify foot ischemia. This study was performed to determine whether laser speckle flowgraphy could distinguish between subjects with and without peripheral arterial disease. Materials and methods All subjects were classified based on clinical observations using the Rutherford classification: non-peripheral arterial disease, class 0; peripheral arterial disease group, class 2-5. Rutherford class 6 was one of the exclusion criteria. Laser speckle flowgraphy measured the beat strength of skin perfusion as an indicator of average dynamic cutaneous blood flow change synchronized with the heartbeat. The beat strength of skin perfusion indicates the strength of the heartbeat on the skin, and the heartbeat strength calculator in laser speckle flowgraphy uses the blood flow data to perform a Fourier transform to convert the temporal changes in blood flow to a power spectrum. A total of 33 subjects with peripheral arterial disease and 40 subjects without peripheral arterial disease at a single center were prospectively examined. Laser speckle flowgraphy was used to measure hallucal and thenar cutaneous blood flow, and the measurements were repeated three times. The hallucal and thenar index was defined as the ratio of beat strength of skin perfusion value on hallux/beat strength of skin perfusion value on ipsilateral thenar eminence. The Mann-WhitneyU-test was used to compare the median values of hallucal and thenar index and ankle brachial index between the two groups. A receiver operating characteristic curve for hallucal and thenar index of beat strength of skin perfusion was plotted, and a cutoff point was set. The correlation between hallucal and thenar index of beat strength of skin perfusion and ankle brachial index was explored in all subjects, the hemodialysis group, and the non-hemodialysis (non-hemodialysis) group. Results The median value of the hallucal and thenar index of beat strength of skin perfusion was significantly different between subjects with and without peripheral arterial disease (0.27 vs. 0.87, respectively;P < 0.001). The median value of ankle brachial index was significantly different between subjects with and without peripheral arterial disease (0.8 vs. 1.1, respectively;P < 0.001). Based on the receiver operating characteristic of hallucal and thenar index, the cutoff was 0.4416 and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 68.7%, 95%, 91.7%, and 77.6%, respectively. The correlation coefficients of all subjects, the hemodialysis group, and the non-hemodialysis group were 0.486, 0.102, and 0.743, respectively. Conclusions Laser speckle flowgraphy is a noninvasive, rapid, and widely applicable method. Laser speckle flowgraphy using hallucal and thenar index would be helpful to determine the differences between subjects with and without peripheral arterial disease. The correlation between hallucal and thenar index of beat strength of skin perfusion and ankle brachial index indicated that this index was especially useful in the non-hemodialysis group.

Methods In the study, EphrinB2 expression was investigated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in 12 pairs of TAD and adjacent human tissues. HASMCs were used for in vitro experiments. Next, EphrinB2 overexpression and depletion in HASMCs were established by EphrinB2-overexpressing vectors and small interfering RNA, respectively. The transfection efficiency was evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The effects of overexpression and depletion of EphrinB2 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were tested in vitro. Cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry and transwell migration/invasion, and wound healing assay were used to explore the function of EphrinB2 on HASMC cell lines. The relationship between EphrinB2 and F-actin was assessed by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and Co-IP. Results We found that EphrinB2 was a prognostic biomarker of TAD patients. Moreover, EphrinB2 expression negatively correlated to aortic dissection tissues, and disease incidence of males, suggesting that EphrinB2 might act as a TAD suppressor by promoting proliferation or decreasing apoptosis in HASMC. Next, over-expression of EphrinB2 in HASMC lines drove cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and inhibited apoptosis while knockdown EphrinB2 showed the opposite phenomenon, respectively. Furthermore, the level of F-actin in mRNA, protein, and distribution in HASMC cell lines highly matched with the expression of EphrinB2, which indicated that EphrinB2 could mediate the HASMC cytoskeleton via inducing F-actin. Conclusions In conclusion, our results first provided the pivotal role of EphrinB2 in HASMC proliferation initiated by mediating F-actin and demonstrated a prognostic biomarker and the potential targets for therapy to prevent thoracic aortic dissection.

Data about the popliteal artery anatomy and its branches are essential to plan a surgical approach. The aim of this study was to report the anatomical variations of the popliteal artery and its branches in a population with aneurysmal disease and compare them with a standard population with non-aneurysmal disease. Methods A retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent surgical PAA repair in our center between January 2011 and December 2020 was performed. One-hundred-forty-six limbs in 128 patients underwent PAA treatment (Group 1). Computed tomography angiography images using a 128-section configuration were reviewed for anatomical variations of the popliteal artery and its branches. A control population of 178 limbs in 89 patients with non-aneurysmal disease was used to compare the outcomes (Group 2). All limbs were classified according to Kim's classification. The two groups were analyzed and compared by means of nonparametric Pearson chi-square test. Results Both groups were homogeneous in terms of demographics, risk factors, and clinical presentation. In Group 1, the limbs with PAA were classified as type IA, 133 (91.1%); type IB, 2 (1.4%); type IC, 0; type IIA1, 1 (0.7%); type IIA2, 1 (0.7%); type IIB, 4 (2.7%); type IIC, 0; type IIIA, 3 (2.1%); type IIIB, 0; and type IIIC, 2 (1.4%). In Group 2 the limbs with non-aneurysmal disease were classified as type IA, 163 (91.6%); type IB, 5 (2.8%); type IC, 1 (0.6%); type IIA1, 1 (0.6%); type IIA2, 3 (1.7%); type IIB, 2 (1.1%); type IIC, 0; type IIIA, 3 (1.7%); type IIIB, 0; and type IIIC, 0. No difference in terms of anatomy of the popliteal artery and its branches was found between the two groups (P = NS). Conclusions Knowledge of anatomical variations of the popliteal artery and its branches is mandatory in case of the surgical approach. Anatomy in PAA patients is not different. Studies with larger population size are needed to validate these outcomes.

We evaluated the angiographic patterns and changes in arterial lesions over time in BD patients with arterial involvement. Methods We reviewed the medical records of BD patients diagnosed with arterial lesions between 1995 and 2018. Angiographic patterns were categorized as stenosis, occlusion, dilatation, or aneurysm. Patients were divided according to symptom duration (<5, 5-10, >10 years). Cox proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate the risk factors for vascular progression. Results 47 BD patients had arterial involvement in the following patterns: aneurysm (n = 31), stenosis (n = 17), dilatation (n = 13), and occlusion (n = 8). Aneurysm (70.8%) was the most common pattern in 24 patients with short (<5 years) symptom duration. Stenosis was more common (50.0%) in 12 patients with longer symptom durations (>10 years). In 23 patients with follow-up imaging (median, 5.7 years), eight (34.8%) developed 11 new lesions: stenosis (n = 5), dilatation (n = 1), and aneurysm (n = 5). One stenotic lesion progressed to occlusion, and two dilated lesions progressed to aneurysms. Lower extremity involvement and methotrexate use were associated with arterial progression, with hazard ratios of 5.716 (p = 0.029) and 0.101 (p = 0.049), respectively. Conclusion In BD patients with arterial involvement, aneurysm was the most common pattern in earlier stages of BD, while stenosis was more common in later stages of BD. Methotrexate use was associated with lower risk of arterial lesion progression.

We report a case of a 42-year-old man suffering from a giant RAA combined with a congenital high-flow RAVF. The contrast-enhanced CTA showed a 12.7-cm RAA synchronous with an RAVF between the right renal artery and a draining vein. After a comprehensive preoperative assessment, an endovascular approach was decided. Successful embolization was performed using an Amplatzer vascular Plug, and multiple coils. Completion angiogram demonstrated no flow into the RAA. The results of longterm follow-up demonstrate that endovascular techniques are safe and effective for the management of RAAs combined with high-flow RAVF.

J	Kim, IS; Cha, J; Jo, WM				Kim, In-Sub; Cha, Jaehyung; Jo, Won-Min			Can concomitant above-knee femoropopliteal bypass with artificial graft affect the outcome of femorofemoral bypass with artificial graft?	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Peripheral arterial disease; iliac artery; femoral artery; popliteal artery	ANGIOPLASTY; DISEASE; ARTERY; STANDARDS; SURGERY; PATENCY	Objectives Few have studied the effect of concomitant femoropopliteal (FEM-POP) bypass surgery on the outcome of femorofemoral (FEM-FEM) bypass in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This study was aimed to analyze the risk relationship of concomitant FEM-POP bypass on the patency of FEM-FEM bypass. Methods From March 2009 to April 2020, a total of 27 patients who underwent FEM-FEM bypass surgery using polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were retrospectively analyzed according to concomitant FEM-POP bypass surgery. The mean follow-up duration was 38.20 +/- 34.56 months. Results The overall primary patency of the FEM-FEM bypass grafts in all 27 patients was 83.7, 78.5, and 72.0 at one, two, and 3 years, respectively. The overall limb salvage rate was 100, 94.1, and 86.9 at one, two, 3 years, respectively. Among them, ten patients underwent FEM-FEM bypass only (group 1). The other 17 patients needed a concomitant FEM-POP bypass and these patients were classified into three groups (group 2, ipsilateral FEM-POP, n = 5; group 3, crossover FEM-POP, n = 6; and group 4, bilateral FEM-POP, n = 6) The comparison of the primary patency of group 1 with the concomitant FEM-POP groups (sum of groups 2, 3, and 4, that is, group 5, n = 17) revealed a statistically significant improved patency for FEM-FEM bypasses not requiring concomitant infra-inguinal bypass (p = .036). Among the concomitant FEM-POP groups, group 2 had the lowest primary patency of the FEM-FEM bypass significantly (p = 0.07). The limb salvage rate of group 4 was significantly low. Conclusions A concomitant FEM-POP bypass influenced the outcome of FEM-FEM bypass surgery. In conclusion, compromised infra-inguinal runoff at either extremity requiring concomitant FEM-POP bypass significantly worsens long-term FEM-FEM bypass patency. In addition, a concomitant bilateral FEM-POP bypass is a risk factor affecting the limb salvage rate in FEM-FEM bypass.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of acupuncture on pain and IL-17 and IL-23 levels in the treatment of endovenous ablation. Methods The study was a randomized controlled trial. Patients were divided into group C (Control, n = 35) and group A (Acupuncture, n = 35). Group A patients were treated with acupuncture 24 h preoperatively. Follow-up checkups were conducted intraoperatively, postoperatively, and on the third day. Results There was no difference between men; there was a difference between women. Visual analog scale score was lower in group A at the intraoperative third and fifth minutes (0.00 vs. 1 and 0.00 vs. 0.5). Analgesic consumption was lower in group A at the end of third day (p = 0.024). Postoperative IL-17 levels were higher than preoperative levels in group A (23.58 vs. 19.33). Postoperative IL-23 levels were lower than preoperative levels in group A (13.66 vs. 29.51). Group C showed increased postoperative IL-23 levels (28.81 vs. 33.51). Preoperative IL-17 and postoperative IL-23 levels were lower in group A than in group C (19.33 vs. 27.69 and 13.66 vs. 33.51). Although no difference was observed between group A and group C in preoperative saphenous vein diameter, postoperative saphenous vein diameter was smaller in group A (p = 0.008). Saphenous vein diameter was smaller on day 3 in group A than in group C (p = 0.043). Conclusion Acupuncture is effective on acute pain and level of IL-23 in the treatment of endovenous ablation using cyanoacrylate.

VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Abdominal aortic aneurysm; ankle-brachial index; peripheral vascular disease; point-of-care devices; pulse waveform; biomarkers	FLOW; METAANALYSIS; FLUID; MODEL	Objective To explore the potential relationship between the presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm and point of care ankle brachial index acquired posterior tibial artery Doppler waveform to inform on a potential novel biomarker of abdominal aortic aneurysm presence. Methods Abdominal aortic aneurysm presence and posterior tibial artery waveform acquired at time of routine point of care ankle brachial index were determined in 182 patients from an abdominal aortic aneurysm evaluation vascular outpatient clinic. Multivariate technical random forest analysis and logistical regression analysis assessed the outcome of abdominal aortic aneurysm presence and included the independent variables of monophasic initial posterior tibial artery waveform and known abdominal aortic aneurysm risk factors. Results Technical random forest analysis produced a model with an accuracy of 0.59. Initial waveform phase was the most important variable included in the model. Logistical regression analysis revealed a statistically significant negative association between initial monophasic posterior tibial artery waveform and abdominal aortic aneurysm presence in patients with ankle brachial index > 0.9. Leave one out cross validation analysis produced a bias-corrected prediction error value of 0.22. Conclusion No robust association between abdominal aortic aneurysm and point of care ankle brachial index acquired posterior tibial artery waveform was found, suggesting that monophasic posterior tibial artery waveform alone may not be a biomarker of abdominal aortic aneurysm presence.

Functional performance status and risk of cardiovascular events and mortality following endovascular repair of thoracic and abdominal aortic pathology	VASCULAR			English	Article						EVAR; TEVAR; functional status; cardiovascular disease; mortality	ANEURYSM REPAIR; COMPLICATIONS; SURVIVAL	Objective To characterize the association of preoperative functional performance status based on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scoring with the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, vascular events, and mortality in patients undergoing EVAR and TEVAR. Methods Retrospective review of the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative, a large, multi-center, registry database was performed. All individuals undergoing EVAR (n = 18,730) and TEVAR (n = 6595) for non-ruptured aortic pathologies between 2014 and 2018 were eligible for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of pre-procedure ECOG functional performance status on risk of in-hospital adverse cardiovascular events, vascular events, and mortality. Results The number of operations complicated by adverse cardiovascular and vascular events was 480 (2.6%) and 190 (1.0%) for EVAR and 733 (11.1%) and 219 (3.3%) for TEVAR, respectively. There were 118 (0.6%) and 240 (3.6%) in-hospital deaths following EVAR and TEVAR, respectively. Patients with ECOG grades 3 or 4 undergoing EVAR were at increased risk of cardiovascular events (OR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.09, 2.41) and one-year mortality (HR = 2.62; 95% CI = 1.92, 3.57) compared to those with ECOG grade 0. Patients undergoing TEVAR with ECOG grade 3 or 4 were at increased risk for both inpatient death (OR = 2.77; 95% CI = 1.56, 4.9) and one-year mortality (HR = 3.27, 95% CI = 2.06, 5.21). ECOG status was not associated with an increased risk of adverse vascular events following either EVAR or TEVAR. Conclusions Poor preoperative functional status as assessed by ECOG score is associated with an increased risk of adverse postoperative cardiovascular events following EVAR and a higher mortality risk following both EVAR and TEVAR.

Radiofrequency ablation for markedly incompetent perforators versus compression therapy in the management of post-phelebtic venous ulcers: A randomized controlled trial	VASCULAR			English	Article						Post-phelebtic venous ulcers; incompetent perforators; radiofrequency ablation; compression therapy; venous reflux; endovenous perforator surgery		Background Venus ulcers developed mainly due to reflux of incompetent venous valves in perforating veins. Patients and methods In this randomized controlled trial, 119 patients recruited over two years, with post-phelebtic venous leg ulcers, were randomly assigned into one of two groups: either to receive radiofrequency ablation of markedly incompetent perforators (Group A, n = 62 patients) or to receive conventional compression therapy (Group B, n = 57 patients). Follow-up duration required for ulcer healing continued for 24 months post randomization. Results Statistically significant shorter time to healing (ulcer complete healing or satisfactory clinical improvement) between both groups (56 patients, 90.3% of cases in Group A versus 44 patients 77.2% of cases in Group B) over the follow-up period of 24 months was attained (p = 0.001). Also, significantly different ulcer recurrence was recorded between both groups, 8 patients (12.9%) in Group A versus 19 patients (33.3%) in Group B (p = 0.004). Conclusion In absence of deep venous obstruction, the monopolar radiofrequency ablation for incompetent perforators is a feasible and effective method that surpasses the traditional compression protocol for incompetent perforator-induced venous ulcers in terms of time required for healing even in the presence of unresolved deep venous valvular reflux.

J	Lv, MN; Jiang, SJ; Wu, TT; Chen, WJ; Zhang, JH				Lv, Meina; Jiang, Shaojun; Wu, Tingting; Chen, Wenjun; Zhang, Jinhua			Efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants combined with antiplatelet drugs for patients with peripheral artery disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials	VASCULAR			English	Review						Anticoagulation therapy; antiplatelet therapy; atherosclerosis; peripheral artery disease	VASCULAR-DISEASE; NATIONAL-HEALTH; RISK-FACTORS; CORONARY; CLOPIDOGREL; PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT; COSTS	Background The efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) combined with antiplatelet drugs in patients with peripheral artery disease remain largely unknown. Objective The aim of this meta-analysis was to explore the effects of NOACs combined with antiplatelet drugs versus antiplatelet drugs alone in this population. Methods A comprehensive search of randomized controlled trials published in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library in 30 September 2020 and before. According to the I-2 statistic, a random or fixed-effect model was used to analyze the safety and effectiveness of NOACs combined with antiplatelet drugs in peripheral artery disease patients. Results Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria, with a total sample size of 11,761 participants. Compared with antiplatelet drugs alone, NOACs combined with antiplatelet drugs resulted in lower risk of ischemic stroke events (OR = 0.75, 95%CI 0.57-0.98, p = 0.03), while other treatment effects were not worse than those of single antiplatelet drugs (p >= 0.05). In addition, although compared with single antiplatelet drugs alone, NOACs combined with antiplatelet drugs had a higher risk of major bleeding and clinically related nonmajor bleeding, their risk was not higher for intracranial hemorrhage, which may endanger the life of patients, or for fatal bleeding. Conclusions In summary, for peripheral artery disease patients, a combination of NOACs plus antiplatelet drugs may offer additional benefit in reducing ischemic stroke outcome, yet it may increase the risk of bleeding.

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore the effects of DOACs in this population. Methods We systematically searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science till April 2020 for relevant randomized controlled trials and observational studies, with no linguistic restrictions. The efficacy outcomes were cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infraction, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), acute limb ischemia, amputation, and target lesion revascularization. The safety outcome was major bleeding events. Random effects risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results A total four randomized controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. Among peripheral arterial disease patients, DOACs did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular death (RR = 1.02 95%CI 0.75-1.37, P = 0.92), stroke (RR = 0.73 95%CI 0.46-1.14, P = 0.16), myocardial infraction (RR = 0.85 95%CI 0.70-1.03, P = 0.10), MACE (RR = 0.73 95%CI 0.46-1.14, P = 0.16), or amputation (RR = 0.73 95%CI 0.46-1.14, P = 0.16) compared with control. However, DOACs were associated with reduction in acute limb ischemia (RR = 0.67 95%CI 0.55-0.80, P < 0.01) and target lesion revascularization (RR = 0.89 95%CI 0.81-0.99, P = 0.02) at the expense of major bleeding events (RR = 1.43 95%CI 1.16-1.77, P < 0.01) compared with control. Conclusions Based on current evidence, no significant difference in cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infraction, MACE, and amputation was found when DOACs were compared to antiplatelet monotherapy. The benefits of preventing target lesion revascularization and acute limb ischemia were balanced by amplified risk of major bleeding. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to figure out the uncertainty around efficacy and safety of medications for peripheral arterial disease.

Multiple duplications of the superficial femoral artery - Case report and review of the literature	VASCULAR			English	Review						Duplication of superficial femoral artery; anatomic variation; embryology		Objectives Lower extremity arterial anatomic variations are rare, with duplication of the superficial femoral artery being an extremely uncommon variant with few prior reports in the literature. Methods/Results: We report the case of a 68-year-old male with calf claudication who underwent angiography and was found to have two separate areas of vessel duplication along the superficial femoral artery, which has not previously been described in the literature. Conclusion Although uncommon, recognition of a duplicated superficial femoral artery is important to avoid difficulties and complications that may arise during open or endovascular procedures.

Systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis impacts clinical outcomes of arteriovenous fistulas in comparison to other end-stage renal disease etiologies	VASCULAR			English	Article						Arteriovenous fistulas; systemic lupus erythematosus; primary patency	CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; VASCULAR ACCESS; ANTICARDIOLIPIN ANTIBODIES; CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA; RISK-FACTORS; PATENCY; COHORT; VALIDATION; NEPHRITIS; PLACEMENT	Objectives Arteriovenous fistulas primary patency at one-year occurs in 43-85% of the patients with end-stage renal disease. The diagnosis attributable to end-stage renal disease has been suggested to impact arteriovenous fistulas outcomes. The objective was to compare primary patency at one week, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-ups, among systemic lupus erythematosus patients and two control groups; additionally, we evaluated the impact of systemic lupus erythematosus to predict early patency loss. Methods A retrospective review of charts from arteriovenous fistulas created between 2008 and 2017 was performed. One-hundred thirty-four patients were identified and classified according to end-stage renal disease attributable diagnosis as: systemic lupus erythematosus cases (N = 14), control-group-1 (91 patients with primarily diabetes and hypertension), and control-group-2 (29 patients with idiopathic end-stage renal disease). A case-control matched design (1:2:1) was proposed. Logistic regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves were used. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Results More systemic lupus erythematosus patients lost primary patency at 3 (28.6%) and 12 months (71.4%) than patients from control-groups-1 (vs. 3.6% and 35.7%, respectively) and -2 (vs. 0% and 14.3%, respectively), (p <= 0.011 for both). Days of primary patency survival were shorter in systemic lupus erythematosus patients (p = 0.003). Systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis was the only factor associated with early patency loss, HR: 3.141, 95%CI: 1.161-8.493 (systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis vs. control-group-1) and HR: 12.582, 95%CI: 1.582-100.035 (systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis vs. control-group-2). Conclusions Diagnosis attributable to end-stage renal disease has a major impact on arteriovenous fistula outcomes in patients. Systemic lupus erythematosus patients have an increased risk of arteriovenous fistulas patency loss within the first six months of follow-up. Patients with idiopathic end-stage renal disease had an excellent one year arteriovenous fistula patency survival.

However, their functionalities in arterial endothelial cells (ECs) have not been investigated. Besides, the issue of vascular remodelling is barely addressed. Objectives The study aimed to determine the effect of overexpression or inhibition of miR-17-5p on arterial endothelial cells' (ECs) function and vascular remodelling in vitro and the rat carotid arteries model. Methods Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to examine the expression of miR-17-5p. Then, gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches were employed to investigate the functional roles of miR-17-5p in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs); further, TargetScan software analysis and luciferase reporter activity assay were performed to investigate the potential mechanism. Lastly, the results of the cell segment were verified in a rat carotid artery balloon injury model by Western blot analysis, measurement of the vascular cGMP level and plasma 8-iso-prostaglandin F2 (8-iso-PGF2) testing. Moreover, morphometric analysis was implemented to detect the re-endothelialization and neointimal formation in rat carotid artery after balloon injury. Results This study firstly found that miR-17-5p expression was upregulated in the injured vascular walls and highly expressive in ECs; overexpression of miR-17-5p inhibited HCAECs' proliferation and migration, whereas miR-17-5p knockdown strengthened its proliferative and migratory roles, influenced inflammatory response, through regulating VEGRA and VEGFR2. It was found that miR-17-5p bind to VEGFA and VEGFR2 at the 3 ' UTR. Next, downregulation of miR-17-5p promotes re-endothelialization, and attenuates neointimal formation as measured by the I/M ratio (0.63 +/- 0.05 vs 1.45 +/- 0.06, antagomiR-17-5p vs. Lenti-NC, p < 0.05). In addition, the functional recovery of the endothelium was also accelerated by miR-17-5p knockdown.

J	Kugler, NW; Lewis, BD; Malinowski, M				Kugler, Nathan W.; Lewis, Brian D.; Malinowski, Michael			Axillary pullout syndrome: A novel approach to managing a devastating complication	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Axillary pullout syndrome; axillary anastomotic dehiscence; anastomotic failure; axillary-femoral bypass	DISRUPTION; GRAFT	Objectives Axillary pullout syndrome is a complex, potentially fatal complication following axillary-femoral bypass graft creation. The re-operative nature, in addition to ongoing hemorrhage, makes for a complicated and potentially morbid repair. Methods We present the case of a 57-year-old man with history of a previous left axillary-femoral-femoral bypass who presented with acute limb-threatening ischemia as a result of bypass thrombosis managed with a right axillary-femoral bypass for limb salvage. His postoperative course was complicated by an axillary anastomotic dehiscence while recovering in inpatient rehabilitation resulting in acute, life-threatening hemorrhage. He was managed utilizing a novel hybrid approach in which a retrograde stent graft was initially placed across the anastomotic dehiscence for control of hemorrhage. He then underwent exploration, decompression, and interposition graft repair utilizing the newly placed stent graft to reinforce the redo axillary anastomosis. Results and Conclusion Compared with a traditional operative approach, the hybrid endovascular and open approach limited ongoing hemorrhage while providing a more stable platform for repair and graft revascularization. A hybrid approach to the management of axillary pullout syndrome provides a safe, effective means to the management of axillary anastomotic dehiscence while minimizing the morbidity of ongoing hemorrhage.

Caroline; Aladegbami, Bola G.; Farquharson, Delton; Lawson, Denny; Bassett, Randy			AbsorbaSeal (TM) 5.6.7F vascular closure device: A good laboratory practice chronic study evaluating safety and efficacy in a healthy porcine model	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						AbsorbaSeal; vascular closure device; arteriotomy; vascular access; manual compression; percutaneous catheter-based intervention	AORTIC-VALVE-REPLACEMENT; FEMORAL-ARTERY PUNCTURE; MANUAL COMPRESSION; CARDIAC-CATHETERIZATION; TRANSCATHETER; COMPLICATIONS	Objectives Vascular closure devices (VCDs) are widely used for arteriotomy closure after percutaneous catheter-based procedures. In comparison to manual compression, VCDs have been associated with shorter time to hemostasis, shorter time to ambulation, and also decreased length of stay. Complexity of deployment, lack of immediate hemostasis, and residual deformity of the arterial wall remain as limitations of current VCDs. The aim of this study was to investigate the AbsorbaSeal (TM) 5.6.7F vascular closure device, a novel, completely bioabsorbable, intuitive, and easy to use VCD which uses a compressive, "sandwich"-type design comprising a low profile intravascular distal seal and gasket and an extravascular floating foot and proximal seal, in an open infrarenal aortic swine model. Methods Eight fully heparinized swine at a good laboratory practices facility underwent AbsorbaSeal (TM) 5.6.7F VCD closure of three 6F arteriotomies each in the proximal, mid, and distal infrarenal aorta. Two swine underwent harvest at each of four time cohorts: 30, 60, 90, and 120 days. Acute and chronic procedural safety and efficacy, as well as target site vascular remodeling over time, were the primary outcomes evaluated. Secondary outcome measures included local and systemic inflammatory responses, end-organ tissue analysis, and device-related complications through the follow-up periods. Histopathological evaluation was performed by a blinded pathologist. Standard statistical methods were used. Results In deployment of 24 AbsorbaSeal (TM) 5.6.7F VCDs, there were no device-related complications or mortalities. All deployments resulted in rapid arteriotomy seal (100% deployment success), with a mean time to hemostasis (cessation of arterial flow) of 21.5 s (median: 6.5 s) across a mean activated clotting time (ACT) of 356 s. Twenty of the 24 implant sites (83%) attained complete hemostasis within 20 s. Immediate post-implant and pre-termination angiographies at all time points were performed of all swine which demonstrated normal aortic appearance and tissue structure and normal downstream vascular beds. At 30 days, each implant's intravascular distal seal and gasket were removed from the circulation and completely covered with a smooth neointimal layer. Minimal inflammation and no intimal or luminal thrombus were observed at any site at every time point. Conclusions AbsorbaSeal (TM) 5.6.7F is a safe, effective, and secure VCD that demonstrates rapid hemostasis in a fully heparinized open aortic porcine model. Removal from circulation and complete coverage of the intravascular distal seal and gasket with neointima occurred within 30 days post-implant. Natural transmural vessel healing from the arteriotomy itself with minimal inflammation was noted for each implant at every time point.

Study design This retrospective cohort study was conducted from February 2016 to January 2020 in our center. Patients with arteriovenous fistula dysfunction, including flow rate insufficiency, venous hypertension, thrombosis, and aneurysm dilation enlargement, were selected. Stenosis lesions presenting with venous valve hyperplasia were selected after ultrasound screening. All patients underwent surgical repair and were followed up every 6 months after surgery. Results Forty-three patients (median age, 54.5 +/- 11.2 years; 65.1% men) were included. All procedures were technically successful. Based on intraoperative exploration, 56.5% were reconstructed via autologous vein patch, 17.4% of patients were reconstructed with end-to-end reconstruction after cutting the stenotic segment, 13.0% of cases simply had the valve resected, and 13.0% of cases involved a longitudinal incision and transverse suture. All patients returned to routine dialysis the following day and avoided catheter insertion. The mean follow-up time was 22.5 +/- 14.0 (range, 1.3-49.8) months. The patency rates at 2 and 4 years were 92.2% and 79.0%, respectively. Valves harvested from patients were analyzed via Masson staining and immunohistochemical staining, indicating collagen fiber and myofibroblast hyperplasia in outflow venous valve hyperplasia (OVVH). Conclusions Outflow venous valve hyperplasia can lead to fistula dysfunction. Ultrasound is the main method to diagnosis OVVH. Special surgical repair can preserve valuable vascular resources and relieve stenosis, is safe and effective, and has a high patency rate.

Popliteal artery patency is an indicator of ambulation and healing after below-knee amputation in vasculopaths	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Below-knee amputation; vascular studies; vessel run-off; ambulation; activities of daily living	LOWER-EXTREMITY AMPUTATION; LOWER-LIMB AMPUTATION; FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES; MOBILITY; COMPLICATIONS; PREDICTORS; FAILURE; FLAPS	Background The posterior flap is a conventional technique for closing a below-knee amputation (BKA) that uses the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle and relies on the popliteal and posterior compartment arteries. If the prior mentioned arterial blood supply is compromised, this flap likely relies on collateral flow. The purpose of this study is to identify and differentiate any significant associations between preoperative popliteal and tibial arterial flow and BKA outcomes and patient-reported function. Methods A retrospective review identified patients from a single tertiary wound care center who received BKAs and angiogram between 2010 and 2017 by a single surgeon. BKA complications, wound healing, and amputee ambulatory status at latest follow-up were all stratified for differences according to baseline tibial vessel run-off (VRO) status, popliteal artery patency, and popliteal angioplasty outcome. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used with significance defined as p <= 0.05. Results BKAs were performed on 313 patients, of which, 167 underwent preoperative angiography. Thirty-two were excluded due to lack of adequate follow-up leaving a total of 135 patients in the studied population. Diabetes was present in 87%, and 36% had end-stage renal disease. By the study's conclusion, 92% of BKAs had fully healed, with median time-to-healing of 79 days (range 19-1314 days). 60% of patients were ambulatory at 9.5 months. Higher VRO was associated with higher healing rates and lower complications and time-to-healing. The conversion rate of BKA to above-knee amputation (AKA) was 4%. Preoperative popliteal patency was associated with higher postoperative ambulation rates when compared to patients without popliteal flow preoperatively (patent: 71/109, 65%; occluded: 10/26, 40%; p = 0.02) and independently increased the likelihood of postoperative ambulation. Conclusions The posterior flap design for BKA works even in the setting of popliteal occlusion. Complication rates are higher in patients with more compromised blood flow, which may ultimately lead to AKA. Given poor ambulation rates in patients who undergo AKA, the results of this study should encourage surgeons to consider a more functional BKA, even in instances when the popliteal artery is occluded.

Despite successful endovascular treatment (EVT) strategies, mortality and morbidity rates still remain higher in PAD patients. C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin are biomarkers of inflammation and malnutrition that play key roles in the progression of peripheral arterial disease. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between CRP-to-albumin ratio (CAR) and mortality and amputation-free survival in patients with PAD after successful EVT. Method Our study enrolled 149 consecutive patients who underwent EVT on atherosclerotic obstruction of iliac, femoral, popliteal and/or below-knee arteries with the clinical features of PAD and/or chronic limb-threatening ischaemia between January 2015 and January 2020. Clinical and prognostic follow-up of patients had been done at the outpatient clinic and were collected from institution's medical records. Results The mean follow-up period was 22 months (14-40). All-cause mortality and amputation rates of patients in the high CAR group were significantly higher than those in the low CAR group (21.3% vs. 6.8% and 18.7% vs. 5.4%, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significantly better survival for patients in the low CAR group (log-rank p = 0.0058). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, CAR was found to be an independent predictor of amputation and all-cause mortality even after adjusting for other confounding risk factors. ROC curve analysis revealed the optimal cut-off value of CAR for predicting all-cause mortality and amputation to be >1.476 with a sensitivity of 48.5% and specificity of 94.0%. Conclusion The inflammatory state reflected by CAR levels was strongly associated with all-cause mortality and amputation after EVT in patients with PAD. Furthermore, CAR was found to be an independent predictor of these clinical outcomes after adjusting for other clinically associated parameters.

Superficial venous reflux at the saphenofemoral junction is a common finding in patients with primary varicose veins. Furthermore, reflux in this essential area is associated with higher clinical stages of the disease and recurrent varicose veins. Therefore, this pilot study aimed to investigate cellular senescence in the immediate area of the saphenofemoral junction in patients with healthy veins, primary varicose veins and additionally in patients with recurrent varicose veins due to a left venous stump. Methods We analyzed vein specimens of the great saphenous vein immediately at the saphenofemoral junction. Healthy veins were collected from patients who underwent arterial bypass reconstructions. Samples with superficial venous reflux derived from patients who received high ligation and stripping or redo-surgery at the groin, respectively. Sections were stained for p53, p21, and p16 as markers for cellular senescence and Ki67 as a proliferation marker. Results A total of 30 samples were examined (10 healthy, 10 primary varicose, and 10 recurrent varicose veins). We detected 2.10% p53(+) nuclei in the healthy vein group, 3.12% in the primary varicose vein group and 1.53% in the recurrent varicose vein group, respectively. These differences were statistically significant (p = 0.021). In the healthy vein group, we found 0.43% p16(+) nuclei. In the primary varicose vein group, we found 0.34% p16(+) nuclei, and in the recurrent varicose vein group, we found 0.74% p16(+) nuclei. At the p < 0.05 level, the three groups tended to be significant without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.085). There was no difference in respect of p21 and Ki67. Conclusion We found significantly higher expression rates of p53 in primary varicose veins at the saphenofemoral junction than in healthy veins. p16 expression tended to be increased in the recurrent varicose vein group. These preliminary findings indicate that cellular senescence may have an impact in the development of varicose veins or recurrence. Further studies addressing this issue are necessary.

J	Keser, BN; Kirman, UN; Kocaaslan, C; Aydin, E				Keser, Betul Nur; Kirman, Ulku Nur; Kocaaslan, Cemal; Aydin, Ebuzer			The association between vascular access type and depressive symptoms in geriatric hemodialysis population	VASCULAR			English	Letter						Arteriovenous fistula; depression; Geriatric Depression Scale-15; geriatric patients; hemodialysis; vascular access		Objectives A well-functioning vascular access is crucial for hemodialysis treatment, and arteriovenous fistula is the recommended vascular access type. Arteriovenous fistula is superior to other vascular access types in many aspects, but the effect of arteriovenous fistula on patients' psychiatric state is not well described yet. The aim of this study is to determine whether there is an association between vascular access type and depression scores. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at two hemodialysis centers. Geriatric Depression Scale-15 was administered to geriatric hemodialysis patients, using >= 5 score as the cut-off value for the presence of depressive symptoms. Descriptive tests, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Pearson's Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman's rank correlation calculation, and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed accordingly to analyze the data. Results Of 75 participants, 34 (45.3%) were female and the mean age was 73.4 +/- 5.9 years (range: 65-92). The prevalence of depressive symptoms in the geriatric hemodialysis population was 53.3%. Central venous catheter, hypertension, and increased time on hemodialysis have been found to be risk factors for higher depression scores (aOR 10.505 (95% CI 1.435-76.900), p = 0.021; aOR 9.783 (95% CI 2.508-38.169), p = 0.001; aOR 1.019 (95% CI 1.003-1.035), p = 0.017, respectively). Among patients with arteriovenous fistula, those with hypertension had higher depression scores (p = 0.008). Conclusions Geriatric hemodialysis patients were found to have depressive symptoms commonly, and central venous catheter, hypertension, and increased time on hemodialysis have been found to be risk factors for presence of depressive symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study highlighting that arteriovenous fistula is associated with lower depression scores and lower prevalence of depressive symptoms.

Methods The mesenchymal transition of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was induced by TGF-beta 1. The angiogenesis, migration, and proliferation of HUVECs undergoing EndMT were examined by tube formation assay, scratch assay, Transwell assay, and CCK-8 assay. Results The outcomes revealed that EndMT promoted angiogenesis, migration, and proliferation of HUVECs and the secretion of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) of HUVECs. Phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) increased in EndMT by inhibiting the mitigation of angiogenesis. Conclusion EndMT induces angiogenesis by promoting the secretion of VEGF, and p-AKT participates in this regulation.

Several chemokines have been reported to act as regulators of angiogenesis. The current study aimed to find whether C-C Motif Chemokine 8 is involved in angiogenesis regulation. Methods To verify whether C-C Motif Chemokine 8 is related to angiogenesis in plaques, carotid plaques were collected from patients with severe carotid stenosis and analysed using CD31 immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. To further clarify the relation between C-C Motif Chemokine 8 and angiogenesis, human umbilical vein endothelium cells and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were treated with C-C Motif Chemokine 8 in the presence or absence of C-C motif chemokine receptor 2-Ab and extracellular regulated MAP kinase 1/2 inhibition (FR180204). Proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelium cells and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were examined with Cell Counting Kit-8 and Transwell chamber assay, respectively. In vitro angiogenesis stimulated by C-C Motif Chemokine 8 was examined using tube formation assay. Ex vivo and in vivo angiogenesis were assessed by mice aortic ring assay and Matrigel plug assay, respectively. C-C motif chemokine receptors of human umbilical vein endothelium cells were examined with real-time PCR, and C-C motif chemokine receptor 1, C-C motif chemokine receptor 2, extracellular regulated MAP kinase 1/2 and phosphorylation-extracellular regulated MAP kinase 1/2 were examined with western blotting assay. Results C-C Motif Chemokine 8 was increased in carotid plaques with severe angiogenesis in both RNA and protein level. C-C Motif Chemokine 8 (5 ng/ml) weakly increased human umbilical vein endothelium cell proliferation, but not on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Migration and tube formation could be induced by C-C Motif Chemokine 8 in both human umbilical vein endothelium cells and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. In mice aortic ring assay and Matrigel plug assay, C-C Motif Chemokine 8 could promote angiogenesis compared to vehicle groups. Phosphorylation of extracellular regulated MAP kinase 1/2 was increased with C-C Motif Chemokine 8 stimulation. The migration and tube formation promoted by C-C Motif Chemokine 8 could be largely blocked by C-C motif chemokine receptor 2-Ab or extracellular regulated MAP kinase 1/2 inhibition (FR180204). Conclusions C-C Motif Chemokine 8 could promote both in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis.

Methods This is a substudy of a prospective observational cohort study (VISION; NCT00512109) in which we recruited patients aged >= 45 years, undergoing surgery for peripheral artery disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm. Blood samples were obtained 24 h preoperatively to measure platelet count, concentrations of coagulation coagulation (fibrinogen, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor:Ristocetin cofactor, antithrombin III), fibrinolysis (dimer D, plasmin-antiplasmin complexes, tissue plasminogen activator) markers and level of soluble CD40 ligand. Incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death (composite endpoint) was assessed in 30-day follow-up. Results The study group included 131 patients at the mean age of 68.3 years among whom reason for surgery was peripheral artery disease in 77 patients (58.8%) and abdominal aortic aneurysm in 54 patients (41.2%). Peripheral artery disease group was characterized by higher platelet count (250.5 versus 209.5 (x10(3)/mu l),p = 0.001), concentrations of fibrinogen (5.4 versus 4.1 (g/l),p < 0.001), factor VIII (176.9 versus 141.9 (%),p < 0.001), von Willebrand factor:Ristocetin cofactor (188.9 versus 152.3 (%),p = 0.009), and soluble CD40 ligand (9016.0 versus 7936.6 (pg/ml),p = 0.005). The dimer D level was higher (808.0 versus 2590.5 (ng/ml),p < 0.001) in the abdominal aortic aneurysm group. Incidence of major cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke) within 30 days from surgery did not differ between the groups (39.0% versus 29.6%,p = 0.27). Conclusions The study suggests higher activation of coagulation and relatively lower fibrinolytic activity in peripheral artery disease group compared to patients undergoing surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysm without a significant difference in cardiovascular outcomes.

This study intended to further explore the long-term safety and efficacy of endovascular therapy for BD-related aortic pseudoaneurysm (BAP). Methods From January 2009 to May 2021, 17 BAP patients who underwent endovascular repair were retrospectively identified and enrolled. Adequate immunosuppressive treatment was instituted before and after endovascular treatment unless emergency surgery was required. The patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months and yearly after the primary endovascular intervention by computed tomography angiography (CTA) examination. Results Nineteen BAPs were identified among 17 patients. BAPs located at the aortic arch were found in three patients (17.6%), descending thoracic aorta in 5 (29.4%), and abdominal aorta in 10 (58.8%; suprarenal abdominal aorta in 2 [11.8%], and infrarenal abdominal aorta in 8 [47.1%]). The mean ESR during admission was 56.5 +/- 24.9 mm/h (range = 30.0-120.0 mm/h), which fell to 22.7 +/- 18.4 mm/h (range = 2.0-74.0 mm/h) before the endovascular intervention (p < 0.001). The rate of favorable immunosuppressive control before intervention is 76.5% (13/17). Technical success was achieved in all patients. Median follow-up time was 57.0 months (interquartile range [IQR] = 21.3-67.3 months). Pseudoaneurysm recurrence was observed in four patients, type I endoleak in one, pseudoaneurysms sac dilation in one, and external iliac artery occlusion in 1. Two patients died of pseudoaneurysm rupture. Five-year accumulated overall rate, recurrence-free rate, and reintervention-free survival rate of BAP patients were 92.8%, 75.4%, and 71.8%, respectively. Conclusion Endovascular treatment in BAP patients seemed to be associated with long-term safety and efficacy with a 5-year overall survival rate of 92.8%.

Furthermore, MALE have several clinical implications and a poor prognosis, so prevention is a fundamental issue. The main objective of the present meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials is to evaluate the effect of different lipid-lowering therapies on MALE incidence in patients with PAD. Methods A meta-analysis of randomized studies that evaluated the use of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with PAD and reported MALE was performed, after searching the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, ScieLO, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Controlled Trials databases. A fixed- or random-effects model was used. Results Five randomized clinical trials including 11,603 patients were identified and considered eligible for the analyses (5903 subjects were allocated to receive lipid-lowering therapy, while 5700 subjects were allocated to the respective placebo/control arms). The present meta-analysis revealed that lipid-lowering therapy was associated with a lower incidence of MALE (OR: 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.66-0.87; I2: 28%) compared to placebo/control groups. The sensitivity analysis shows that the results are robust. Conclusion This study demonstrated that the use of lipid-lowering therapy compared with the placebo/control arms was associated with a marked reduction in the risk of MALE. Physicians involved in the monitoring and treatment of patients with PAD must work hard to ensure adequate lipid-lowering medication in these patients.

Material and Methods: A systematic review of literature from the database inception to January 2021 in PubMed and Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library in accordance to PRISMA was conducted. Retrieval and extraction was performed by two independent reviewers. The hierarchy of the evidence was assessed through the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Checklist. Data were subjected to pooled prevalence analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival and test of probability using log-rank analysis. This review is registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews: RD42021231314. Results: 82 studies with n = 123 cases met the inclusion criterion. Abdominal (45%) aorta was the commonest anatomical site with female predominance in ascending aorta (4:1) and aortic arch (2:1). The longest survival was in the ascending aorta and the shortest in the abdominal aorta [540 (interquartile range [IQR], 7-1560 days vs. 180 (IQR, 1-5730 days)], respectively. The overall median survival was 210 days (IQR, 1-5730 days) or 7 months. Lack of metastasis (47%) was a marker of longer survival (p < 0.03) irrespective of other attributes. Conclusion: The pathophysiology appears to be a trend of increasing fatigue, fever and weight loss associated with segmental dysfunction of the aorta projecting occlusive or destructive phenotypes. Computed tomography angiography features of volume-occupying, bulky, polypoid (intraluminal), protrusive vegetation, hyper vascular without atherosclerotic lesions are extremely suggestive of PA of the aorta at 5th and 6th decades of life.

Endovascular aortic repair with EndoAnchors demonstrate good mid-term outcomes in physician-initiated multicenter analysis-The PERU registry	VASCULAR			English	Article						EVAR; EndoAnchors; ESAR; type IaEL; hostile neck anatomy	ANEURYSM REPAIR; COMPLICATIONS; HOSTILE	Objectives: We aim to describe real-world outcomes from multicenter data about the efficacy of adjunct Heli-FX EndoAnchor usage in preventing or repairing failures during infrarenal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), so-called EndoSutured-aneurysm-repair (ESAR). Methods: The current study has been assigned an identifier (NCT04100499) at the US National Library of Medicine (https://ClinicalTrials.gov). It is an observational retrospective study of prospectively collected data from seven vascular surgery departments between June 2010 and December 2019. Patients included in the ANCHOR registry were excluded from this analysis. The decision for the use of EndoAnchors was made by the treating surgeon or multidisciplinary aortic committee according to each center's practice. Follow-up imaging was scheduled according to each center's protocol, which necessarily included either abdominal ultrasound or radiography or computed tomographic scan imaging. The main outcomes analyzed were technical success, freedom from type Ia endoleaks (IaEL), all-cause and aneurysm-related mortality, and sac variation and trends evaluated for those with at least six months imaging follow-up. Results: Two hundred and seventy-five patients underwent ESAR in participating centers during the study period. After exclusions, 221 patients (184 males, 37 females, mean age 75 +/- 8.3 years) were finally included for analysis. Median follow-up for the cohort was 27 (interquartile range 12-48) months. A median 6 (interquartile range 3) EndoAnchors were deployed at ESAR, 175 (79%) procedures were primary and 46 (21%) revision cases, 40 associated with type IaEL. Technical success at operation (initial), 30-day, and overall success were 89, 95.5, and 96.8%, respectively; the 30-day success was higher due to those with subsequent spontaneous proximal endoleak seal. At two years, freedom from type IaEL was 94% for the whole series; 96% and 86% for the primary and revision groups, respectively; whereas freedom from all-cause mortality, aneurysm-related mortality, and reintervention was 89%, 98%, and 87%, respectively. Sac evolution pre-ESAR was 66 +/- 15.1 vs. post ESAR 61 +/- 17.5 (p < 0.001) and for 180 patients with at least six-month follow-up, 92.2% of them being in a stable (51%) or regression (41%) situation. Conclusions: This real-world registry demonstrates that adjunct EndoAnchor usage at EVAR achieves high rates of freedom from type IaEL at mid-term including in a high number of patients with hostile neck anatomy, with positive trends in sac-size evolution. Further data with longer follow-up may help to establish EndoAnchor usage as a routine adjunct to EVAR, especially in hostile necks.

Here we aimed to explore the temporal profile of the stress marker cortisol and its relationship to high-sensitivity troponin-T, matrix metalloproteinase-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and S100B as an indicator of blood-brain barrier alteration in the systemic circulation. Methods Prospective part of the study: a total of 31 patients with significant carotid stenosis scheduled for carotid endarterectomy in regional anesthesia were enrolled. Follow-up part of the study and retrospective analysis of the outcome: each patient was followed up to five years and morbidity as well as mortality data were collected from an electronic database. Blood samples from each patient were serially taken; prior to surgery (T1), at the time of reperfusion (T2), 24 h (T3) and 72 h later postoperatively (T4), then the plasma concentration of each biomarker was measured. Besides, the clinical and surgical factors and perioperative adverse events were recorded. Results More positive correlations were found between: the early change of S100B (T2-T1) and late change in plasma cortisol level (T4-T3) (r = 0.403; p < 0.05); the early change of cortisol (T2-T1) and the early postoperative change of plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 level (T3-T2) (r = 0.432; p = 0.01); the plasma concentration of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 at 24 postoperative hours and the late change in plasma high-sensitivity troponin-T level (T4-T3) (r = 0.705; p < 0.001). Five patients needed an intraoperative shunt in whom the high-sensitivity troponin-T was elevated even prior to surgery, but definitive stroke never occurred. Plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 concentration at reperfusion independently predicted the five-year mortality with a cut-off value of 456 ng/ml (sensitivity: 86%, specificity: 84%, area 0.887, p = 0.002). Conclusions A higher intraoperative change in S100B level reflecting carotid endarterectomy induced acute silent brain ischemia was associated with more pronounced post-operative change of cortisol. An early elevation of cortisol was found to be associated with a delayed increase of matrix metalloproteinase-9. Importantly, an increased high-sensitivity troponin-T even prior to carotid endarterectomy may predict clamp intolerance, and elevated matrix metalloproteinase-9 at reperfusion suggests a poor outcome.

J	Bowden, S; VanAsseldonk, B; Eisenberg, N; Mafeld, S; Roche-Nagle, G				Bowden, Sylvie; VanAsseldonk, Brandon; Eisenberg, Naomi; Mafeld, Sebastian; Roche-Nagle, Graham			Ten-year trends in iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis treatment and referral pathways	VASCULAR			English	Article						Deep vein thrombosis; iliofemoral; post-thrombotic syndrome; thrombolysis; management; referral		Objectives Iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis is associated with an increased risk of developing post-thrombotic syndrome resulting in reduced quality of life. As there is debate about best management practices, this study aimed to examine the referral and treatment pathways for patients presenting with iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis over an 11-year period at our institution. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with lower limb deep vein thrombosis between 2010 and 2020. Ultrasound report findings were reviewed for the presence of iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis with acute, occlusive, or proximal clot. Multiple factors were extracted, including patient demographics, risk factors, diagnostic methods, interventions, referrals, and details of follow-up. The CaVenT and ATTRACT trials studied the benefit of thrombolysis in the early phase of iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis management as compared to anticoagulation alone. An analysis was conducted of patients requiring thrombolysis to determine whether these trials impacted physician practice patterns for thrombolysis. Data were organized and examined by year for trends in treatment and referral pathways. Results The review yielded 2792 patients assessed for lower limb deep venous thrombosis by ultrasound. Four hundred and sixty-seven (16.7%) patients were confirmed to have an occlusive iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis. The average age was 62.7 years (18-101 years). Half (50.4%) of the patients were male. The most common etiology for clot was malignancy-induced hypercoagulable state (39.0%). There was no difference in incidence of iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis diagnosed by ultrasound per year, with an average of 42.5 per year and a peak of 61. There was a trend towards increased rates of computed tomography imaging, ranging between 9.1% and 52.9%. The rate thrombolysis per year ranged between 1.8% and 8.9%, with a range of 4.3% (n = 20) to 8.9% (n = 5) in 2018. The use of pharmacomechanical thrombolysis increased, from 25% (n = 1) in 2010-2012 to 87.5% (n = 7) in 2018-2020. The rate of inferior vena cava filter insertion alone decreased from 18.2% in 2010 (n = 4) to 5.9% (n = 1) in 2020. The length of thrombolysis treatment also decreased, from 100% of patients (n = 4) receiving treatment duration greater than 24 h in 2010-2012 to 0% (n = 0) in 2018-2020. About 45% of patients receiving thrombolysis (n = 9) had venous stenting. No difference in treatment outcomes were observed, with greater than 87.5% of patients reaching intermediate to full resolution of clot burden. No patients experienced intracranial hemorrhage. Conclusions The results of this analysis highlight the change in practice in our institution over time. The low rate of intervention likely reflects the current lack of consensus in published guidelines. It is important for future work to elicit the most appropriate management pathways for patients with iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis.

Detection of residual varicose veins with near infrared light in the early period after varicose surgery and near infrared light assisted sclerotherapy	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Near infrared light; residual varicose vein; varicose veins surgery; foam sclerotherapy	EPIDEMIOLOGY	Objectives Varicose veins that cannot be seen with the naked eye can be easily detected with Near Infrared (NIR) light. With a minimally invasive procedure performed with NIR light guided, the need for reoperation is reduced, while optimal treatment of venous insufficiency and symptoms is provided. In this study, the detection of residual varicose veins after varicose vein surgery using NIR light and the results of treatment of sclerotherapy were investigated. Methods In this retrospective study, treatment and clinical outcomes of patients' who underwent NIR light-guided foam sclerotherapy for Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) (C1, C2) stage residual varicose veins after surgical varicose treatment between 2014 and 2017 were examined. Data of patients who underwent foam sclerotherapy with NIR light were collected and analyzed. Results A total of 151 patients and 171 lower extremity varicose veins were treated with surgery. 55 (35.7%) of the patients were male, and 96 (62.3%) were female. Their age ranges from 20 to 64, with an average age of 45.38. 4 (2.6%) of the patients had phlebectomy. 137 of patients (90.7%) had ligation of perforated veins, phlebectomy, and great saphenous vein (GSV) stripping, 10 of patients (6.6%) had GSV stripping, perforating vein ligation, phlebectomy, and small saphenous vein (SSV) surgery. No residual leakage was observed in the controls of GSV, SSV, and perforating veins by duplex ultrasonography (DUS). In the first month after varicose surgery, an average of 1.64 +/- 1.05 sessions of sclerotherapy was applied to patients with CEAP C1, C2 stage residual varicose veins. 70 patients had one session of sclerotherapy, 37 patients had two sessions of sclerotherapy, 20 patients had three sessions of sclerotherapy, and 11 patients had four sessions of sclerotherapy administrated. The need for complementary therapy was required for all female patients; 13 of the male patients did not require complementary sclerotherapy. While single-session sclerotherapy was applied to most male patients (32 (58.18%), 10 (18.18%) patients received two sclerotherapy sessions. After completing sclerotherapy, 7 (4.63%) patients had superficial venous thrombosis, and 13 (8.60%) patients had hyperpigmentation. Conclusion Surgical treatment is a safe and effective technique in venous insufficiency. Nevertheless, residual varicose veins may remain, and these can be detected noninvasively with NIR light. Foam sclerotherapy with NIR light is a minimally invasive and safe treatment method for small residual varicose veins after the operation. We think that sclerotherapy with NIR light as a complementary treatment is a practical, reliable, and demanding treatment for clinical improvement, especially in female patients.

However, there are currently no effective methods to reverse or prevent it. The present study aimed to determine the ameliorative effect of allicin on VC. Methods VC model of rats was induced by high-dose vitamin D-3, which was valued by Alizarin Red staining, calcium contents, and alkaline phosphatase in the aorta. Systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and pulse wave velocity were measured to determine aortic stiffness. Protein levels were detected by Western blot. Results Allicin treatment rescued aortic VC and stiffness. The increased protein levels of RUNX2 and BMP2, two markers of osteoblastic phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells, in the calcified aorta were attenuated by allicin, whereas the decreased levels of calponin and SM22 alpha induced by calcification were improved. Allicin treatment significantly attenuated the increased protein levels of GRP78, GRP94, and CHOP, which are key markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, in the calcified aorta. The activation of PERK/eIF2 alpha/ATF4 cascades was also prevented by allicin. Conclusions Allicin could ameliorate aortic VC and stiffness. The ameliorative effect of allicin on VC might be mediated by inhibiting PERK/eIF2 alpha/ATF4 cascades. Our results might provide a new proof for VC treatment.

J	Kasimzade, F; Ada, F				Kasimzade, Ferit; Ada, Fatih			Comparison of one-year patency rates of end-to-side and side-to-side anastomosis technique in proximal forearm region radial-cephalic fistulas	VASCULAR			English	Article						Arteriovenous fistula; side-to-side; end-to-side; hemodialysis; fistula patency; fistula maturation	ARTERIOVENOUS-FISTULA; PERFORATING VEIN; KIDNEY-DISEASE; HEMODIALYSIS; CREATION; ACCESS; ELBOW	Objectives In this study, the effects of anastomosis techniques on the results of patients with autogenous radial-cephalic proximal forearm fistula were investigated. Methods Patients who underwent radial-cephalic proximal forearm fistula surgery (arteriovenous fistula) between April 2015 and August 2017 at the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of Ordu University were compared retrospectively in terms of the results of anastomosis techniques. The study included 131 patients who had arteriovenous fistulas created by side-to-side and end-to-side anastomosis technique. Results There was no significant difference in demographic data, comorbidities, radial artery, and cephalic vein diameters in patients undergoing radial-cephalic proximal forearm fistula surgery. However, it was observed that fistula maturation was earlier in the group with end-to-side anastomosis technique, and the one-year patency rates were higher in the group with side-to-side anastomosis technique. Conclusion In Arteriovenous fistulas created in the proximal forearm region, the one-year patency rate of the side-to-side anastomosis technique was higher, while the maturation of the end-to-side technique observed earlier.

Methods In this multicenter, retrospective, clinical trial, 398 symptomatic subjects with incompetent GSVs were assigned to either cyanoacrylate closure or RFA. The primary endpoint, complete closure of the target GSV, was determined using duplex ultrasound examination starting from one-, three-, and six-month visits. Results All patients were followed for 6 months and there was no difference between the groups in terms of mean follow-up time. Hospital stay and return to work/activity were shorter in the cyanoacrylate ablation (CAA) group, and these differences between the groups were statistically significant. Ecchymosis was observed higher in the RFA group and was statistically significant. Conclusions In this study, in which we examined the CAA and RFA methods, we found that both methods were effective and reliable; however, we found that patients in the CAA group had a more comfortable postoperative period and returned to work earlier.

High incidence of patients lost to follow-up after venous thromboembolism diagnosis - Identifying an unmet need for targeted transition of care	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Venous thromboembolism; transition of care; loss to follow-up; quality improvement	DEEP-VEIN THROMBOSIS; ANTICOAGULANT-THERAPY; MANAGEMENT	Objectives Venous thromboembolism, including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a major source of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization. Given the prevalence of venous thromboembolism and its associated mortality, our study sought to identify factors associated with loss to follow-up in venous thromboembolism patients. Methods This is a single-center retrospective study of all consecutive admitted (inpatient) and emergency department patients diagnosed with acute venous thromboembolism via venous duplex examination and/or chest computed tomography from January 2018 to March 2019. Patients with chronic deep venous thrombosis and those diagnosed in the outpatient setting were excluded. Lost to venous thromboembolism-specific follow-up (LTFU) was defined as patients who did not follow up with vascular, cardiology, hematology, oncology, pulmonology, or primary care clinic for venous thromboembolism management at our institution within three months of initial discharge. Patients discharged to hospice or dead within 30 days of initial discharge were excluded from LTFU analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 16 (College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC) Results During the study period, 291 isolated deep venous thrombosis, 25 isolated pulmonary embolism, and 54 pulmonary embolism with associated deep venous thrombosis were identified in 370 patients. Of these patients, 129 (35%) were diagnosed in the emergency department and 241 (65%) in the inpatient setting. At discharge, 289 (78%) were on anticoagulation, 66 (18%) were not, and 15 (4%) were deceased. At the conclusion of the study, 120 patients (38%) had been LTFU, 85% of whom were discharged on anticoagulation. There was no statistically significant difference between those LTFU and those with follow-up with respect to age, gender, diagnosis time of day, venous thromboembolism anatomic location, discharge unit location, or anticoagulation choice at discharge. There was a non-significant trend toward longer inpatient length of stay among patients LTFU (16.2 days vs. 12.3 days, p = 0.07), and a significant increase in the proportion of LTFU patients discharged to a facility rather than home (p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, we found a 95% increase in the odds of being lost to venous thromboembolism-specific follow-up if discharged to a facility (OR 1.95, CI 1.1-3.6, p = 0.03) as opposed to home. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that over one-third of patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism at our institution are lost to venous thromboembolism-specific follow-up, particularly those discharged to a facility. Our work suggests that significant improvement could be achieved by establishing a pathway for the targeted transition of care to a venous thromboembolism-specific follow-up clinic.

Our study aims to investigate the predictive role of pre-operative neutrophil/lymphocyte and platelet/lymphocyte ratios in terms of mortality and amputation risk in patients with acute limb ischaemia. Methods Pre-operative blood samples of all patients admitted with acute limb ischaemia were used to calculate neutrophil/lymphocyte and platelet/lymphocyte ratios. Population was subdivided into quartiles by platelet/lymphocyte ratio and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio values, and Kaplan-Meier life tables were obtained for overall survival and limb salvage. The optimal neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and platelet/lymphocyte ratio cut-offs were obtained from receiver operating characteristic curves with all-cause mortality and all kinds of amputation. Stepwise multivariate analysis was performed in order to identify independent risk and protective factors for mortality and amputations. Results A total of 168 patients were included in the analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curves identified cut-off values for neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and platelet/lymphocyte ratio: neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio >= 5.57 for mortality; neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio >= 6.66 and platelet/lymphocyte ratio >= 269.9 for all amputations. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that survival rate in group neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio <5.57 was 83.4%, 78.9%, 73.7%, and 59.8%, respectively, at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months; in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio >= 5.57 group was 62.4%, 51.3%, 47.8, and 43.7%, respectively (p < 0.0001). Freedom from all amputations was significantly higher in case of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and platelet/lymphocyte ratio below the identified cut-off values (p < 0.0001). Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and platelet/lymphocyte ratio were found as independent risk factors. Conclusion Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and platelet/lymphocyte ratio are reliable markers for stratification of mortality and limb amputations in patients with acute limb ischaemia. The inexpensive nature and ready availability of these biomarkers' values reinforced their usefulness in everyday clinical practice.

A lack of disclosure about CAM use from patients has been universally cited and may impact effective patient-doctor communication. Our primary objective was to describe CAM use, modalities, perceived benefits, safety, and associated factors among adult patients attending a VS outpatient clinic; we additionally explored patient's attitudes about CAM disclosure with their primary vascular surgeon. Methods This cross-sectional study invited 223 consecutive outpatients to an interview where the ICAM-Q (International Complementary and Alternative Medicine Questionnaire) and the PDRQ-9 (Patient-Doctor Relationship Questionnaire-9 items) were applied. In addition, sociodemographics, vascular disease and treatment-related information, comorbidity, and disease severity characteristics were obtained. Appropriated statistics was used; multiple logistic regression analysis identified factors associated to CAM use. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a p value <= 0.05 was considered significant. IRB approval was obtained. Results Patients recruited were primary females (69%) and had a median age of 65 years (54-75). Most frequent vascular diagnoses were chronic venous insufficiency (36.2%) and peripheral artery disease (26%). There were 104 (46.6%) patients who referred CAM use, primarily self-helped practices (96%), and use of herbal, vitamins, or homeopathic medicines (23.7%). Overall, the majority of the patients perceived CAM modalities helpful and 94.6% denied any adverse event. Female sex (OR: 1.768, 95% CI: 0.997-3.135, p = 0.051) and hospitalization during the previous year (OR: 3.173, 95% CI: 1.492-6.748, p = 0.003) were associated to CAM use. The majority of the patients (77%) agreed about CAM disclosure with their primary vascular surgeon; meanwhile, among CAM users, up to 54.9% did not disclose it, and their main reasons were "Doctor didn't ask" (32%) and "I consider it unnecessary" (16%). The patient-doctor relationship was rated by the patients with high scores. Conclusions CAM use is frequent and perceived as safe and beneficial among VS outpatients; nonetheless, patients do not disclose CAM use with their primary vascular surgeons, and a wide range of reasons are given by the patients that prevent effective and open communication.

We hereby describe a patient, who presented with impaired renal functions, four months following the renal transplantation. He underwent intravascular ultrasound-guided PTRA of the bifurcation lesion of TRAS. Results and conclusion: Superior renal artery had coronary drug-eluting stent implantation, while inferior renal artery and side branch of the superior renal artery had balloon angioplasty, alone. Post-intervention, the raised serum creatinine level decreased from 2.9 mg% to 1.7 mg%. The index case described the successful PTRA and stenting of the bifurcation lesion of TRAS, the technical results of which was optimized with the use of intravascular ultrasound.

Methods A total of 1120 patients were enrolled to the analysis after the exclusion of 199 patients who did not match the inclusion criteria. Patients were asked to answer the VEINES-Sym questionnaire and questions about ecchymosis and coldness. Scores of ecchymosis and coldness were calculated similar to VEINES-Sym questionnaire. Classifications of peripheral varicose vein were made according to the clinical part of clinical, etiological, anatomical, and pathophysiological classification system and patients with grade 2 or higher were considered as positive for peripheral varicose vein. Results Frequency of symptoms present in the VEINES-Sym instrument, ecchymosis and coldness were significantly higher in patients with peripheral varicose vein. Mean score of each symptom was significantly lower in peripheral varicose vein patients including scores of ecchymosis and coldness. Logistic regression analysis revealed that presence of hemorrhoids and all symptoms in VEINES-Sym questionnaire except restless leg were significantly and independently associated with peripheral varicose vein. Besides, ecchymosis (odds ratio: 2.04, 95% confidence interval: 1.34-3.08, p = 0.008) but not coldness was significantly and independently associated with peripheral varicose vein. There was also significant correlation of VEINES-Sym score with ecchymosis (r = 0.43, p < 0.001) and coldness (r = 0.47, p < 0.001). Conclusions Venous leg symptoms present in VEINES-Sym questionnaire except restless legs, presence of hemorrhoids and ecchymosis are significantly and independently associated with peripheral varicose vein. Not only ecchymosis but also coldness has shown an independent association with total VEINES-Sym score.

Methods Between January 2008 and June 2014, a retrospective review was conducted on ACS patients who had undergone elective CEA. The patients' sample was divided into two groups: Group A (GA) included octogenarians and Group B (GB) included younger patients. The GA patients were subjected to a risk-scoring system and follow-up. The two groups were compared analysing the following primary endpoints: 30-day mortality, stroke, stroke/death and acute myocardial infarction (AMI); GA patients' survival rate and freedom from neurological events at 5 years. The 30-day secondary endpoints included carotid shunting, redo surgical, need for general anaesthesia with preserved consciousness (GAPC) conversion and length of hospital stay. Results We identified 620 patients with ACS, of them 144 (23.2%) belonged to the GA and 476 (76.8%) belonged to the GB. No statistical difference between the two groups was found regarding the primary and secondary endpoints. One hundred nineteen of 144 GA patients (82.6%) underwent the follow-up; the median follow-up was 78.3 months. The GA patients' 5-year survival rate was 62%, while freedom from cerebral events was 94.9%. Analysis regarding GA patients' 5-year survival rate revealed a significantly lower percentage among the patients with a severe risk score compared with those with a moderate risk score (respectively, 29.5% vs 67.7%; p = .005). The multivariate analysis showed that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were independently associated with lower survival. Conclusions The 30-day outcomes of CEA in octogenarians are comparable to those in younger patients.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of CI-AKI in these patients and identify potential predictive factors. Methods Patients admitted for acute mesenteric ischemia who had a diagnostic CTA with contrast medium and a follow-up of creatinine concentration were retrospectively included. Results Among 53 patients included, 9 (16.9%) developed CI-AKI. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease did not differ significantly between those who developed CI-AKI and those who did not (33.3 vs 18.2%, p=.372). Plasma total bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin levels were significantly higher in patients who developed CI-AKI (17.5 vs 8.0 mu mol/L, p=.013 and 8.0 vs 3.0 mu mol/L, p=.031, respectively). The proportion of patients who had revascularization was similar between patients who developed CI-AKI and those who did not (11.1 vs 20.5%, p>.999). No significant difference was observed for 30-day mortality and all-cause mortality for a median follow-up of 168 days (22.2 vs 13.6%, p=.611; and 33.3 vs 61.4%, p=.153, respectively). Conclusion This study reports the incidence of CI-AKI in patients with acute mesenteric ischemia after diagnostic CTA with contrast medium. Plasma bilirubin levels were a predictive factor of CI-AKI in these patients. The administration of contrast media during revascularization was not associated with an increased risk of CI-AKI.

Furthermore, the severity of inflammation is closely related to the absolute value and proportion of each leukocyte subgroup. Only few reports have analyzed the importance of lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) as a potential inflammatory marker in vascular diseases. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of peripheral blood LMR on thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with TAA. Methods A retrospective study of the clinical data collected in our hospital between January 2016 and January 2021 was performed on 162 patients with TAA treated with TEVAR, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient selection. Based on whether the patient had the clinical symptoms at admission and the occurrence of type I endoleaks during operation, patients were divided into two groups, respectively: an intraoperative type I endoleak group (n = 34) and a group without intraoperative type I endoleak (n = 128), and a group with clinical symptoms (n = 31) and a group without clinical symptoms (n = 131). The clinical data of these two groups were compared, the free from second intervention rates related to endoleak and the preoperatively LMR of the two groups was calculated. LMR was calculated preoperatively. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the cut-off for preoperative LMR values. Based on the cut-off point, patients were divided into a high LMR group (n = 34) and a low LMR group (n = 128). The clinical data of the two groups were compared, and further stratified analysis was performed. Results A total of 162 patients were included in the analysis. All patients were successfully implanted with a thoracic aorta stent graft. The preoperative LMR level and postoperative endoleak-related secondary intervention rate were higher in the type I endoleak group than those in the group without intraoperative type I endoleaks. The preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) level of patients with TAA with clinical symptoms was higher than that of asymptomatic patients. There was a negative correlation between preoperative CRP and LMR levels. In addition, in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients, the LMR level was associated with the occurrence of intraoperative type I endoleaks. After excluding the influence of type of endografts, our results showed that the clinical symptoms did not affect the occurrence of the intraoperative type I endoleak, and patients with intraoperative type I endoleak had a higher rate of postoperative secondary intervention. Conclusion Patients with TAA with type I endoleaks during TEVAR had an increased rate of secondary intervention related to endoleaks.

Peripheral arterial disease, defined by low ankle-brachial index, is associated with increased mortality in patients on hemodialysis. The present study aimed to determine the relationship between the serum indoxyl sulfate level and peripheral arterial disease in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Methods The present cross-sectional, single-center study included 75 patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Serum indoxyl sulfate levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Ankle-brachial index values were measured using an automated oscillometric device. Patients with ankle-brachial indexes of < 0.9 were categorized into the low ankle-brachial index group. Results In the study cohort, 12 of the 75 patients (16.0%) had low ankle-brachial indexes. The rates of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.010) as well as the serum levels of C-reactive protein (p < 0.001) and indoxyl sulfate (p < 0.001) were higher in the low ankle-brachial index group than the normal ankle-brachial index group. The multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that serum levels of indoxyl sulfate (odds ratio = 1.123, 95% confidence interval 1.011-1.249, p = 0.031) and C-reactive protein (each 0.1 mg/dL increase, odds ratio = 1.169, 95% confidence interval 1.018-1.343, p = 0.027) were independently associated with peripheral arterial disease in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Conclusions Serum indoxyl sulfate levels were associated with peripheral arterial disease in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of serum miR-28-5p in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis and its regulation on the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. Methods Serum miR-28-5p levels in 65 healthy controls and 68 asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients were detected by qRT-PCR. The receiver-operating characteristic curve was applied to elucidate the diagnostic value of serum miR-28-5p for carotid artery stenosis patients. The specificity of miRNA targets was detected by luciferase reporter assay. CCK-8 and Transwell assay were applied to detect proliferation and migration of cells. Pearson correlation test was used to investigate the correlation between Forkhead box subclass O 1 (FOXO1) and serum miR-28-5p. Results Serum miR-28-5p was significantly reduced in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients. Moreover, miR-28-5p could distinguish asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients from healthy controls, with sensitivity and specificity of 86.8% and 81.5%, respectively, indicating its high diagnostic value. The overexpression of miR-28-5p inhibited the proliferation and migration of VSMCs, while inhibition of miR-28-5p resulted in the opposite effect. What is more, FOXO1, a direct target of miR-28-5p, was significantly increased in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis patients. Inhibition of miR-28-5p in VSMCs reversed the reduction of FOXO1 levels in patients. Conclusions miR-28-5p is a valuable diagnostic biomarker for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis and can affect the proliferation and migration of VSMCs by regulating FOXO1.

L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) for the treatment of aortoiliac aneurysms by using the GALIBER registry. Methods Patients with aortoiliac or isolated common iliac/hypogastric aneurysms treated with Iliac Branch Endoprosthesis device between January 2014 and May 2019 were prospectively collected from 5 centers. Demographic, clinical, and radiologic data were extracted from electronic databases. Technical success was defined as successful implantation of the Iliac Branch Endoprosthesis device with exclusion of aortoiliac aneurysm, as well as patency of Iliac Branch Endoprosthesis in the follow-up. Iliac Branch Endoprosthesis patency was evaluated by Doppler ultrasound and/or computed tomography based on the protocol of each participant center. Follow-up was 731 days +/- 499. Results Between January 2014 and May 2019, 105 iliac arteries were treated with GORE(R) IBE device, in 81 patients (79 men, two women; mean age 71, range 52-91). Only seven patients (8.6%) were symptomatic. 60 patients (74%) had aortic and iliac enlargement. Thirty-three patients presented bilateral iliac aneurysms (40.7%): In twenty-four (29.6%) patients, an Iliac Branch Endoprosthesis device was implanted in both sides, and in nine patients (11.1%), one Iliac Branch Endoprosthesis was used with the embolization of the contralateral hypogastric artery. Technical success was achieved in the 99% (104/105 iliac branch device implanted). There were no procedural deaths or type I or III intraoperative endoleaks observed. During the follow-up (range 55-1789 days), 28 (34.5%) type II endoleaks were observed and one (1.2%) type Ia was observed. The patency of the hypogastric arteries treated with the iliac branch device was 98.1% during the follow-up (range 55-1789 days). In 30% of the patients with contralateral hypogastric embolization, some kind of complications was observed in the embolizated side: one developed ischemic colitis and two buttock claudication. Conclusions Preservation of internal iliac artery with the Iliac Branch Endoprosthesis device can be performed safely with excellent technical success and good medium-term patency rates. These results support hypogastric preservation whenever possible to prevent ischemic complications.

Methods A retrospective analysis of all patients with prosthetic peripheral and aortic graft infections who underwent in situ reconstruction using a biosynthetic collagen prosthesis between March 2015 and November 2020 was conducted. Perioperative and midterm outcomes were analyzed. Results A biosynthetic collagen prosthesis was used in 19 patients (14 males, median age 66 years) to reconstruct the femoral artery (n = 6), iliac artery (n = 1), and infrarenal aorta (n = 12). All patients were treated for a prosthetic vascular graft infection. The median follow-up period was 26.6 months (range 1-66 months). The 30-day graft failure rate was 15.7% (n = 3), leading to a major amputation in one patient (5.3%). All grafts were occluded aortofemoral reconstructions in patients with occluded superficial femoral artery and were treated by immediate thrombectomy. The 30-day mortality rate was 5.3% (n = 1), and survival after 3 years was 63.2%. The reinfection rate was 5.3% (n = 1). At 13.6 months, the occlusion of a femoral graft was detected in 5.3% (n = 1) and was treated with a new interposition graft. We observed no graft rupture or degeneration during follow-up. Conclusions Although results of in situ repair with autologous vein seem to be superior with little or none reinfection and low number of occlusions, biosynthetic collagen prostheses show acceptable midterm outcomes in terms of graft occlusion and mortality after prosthetic peripheral and aortic graft infections. Similar to other xenogenous materials, the reinfection rate is low with this prosthesis. With regard to immediate availability and easy handling, the use of a biosynthetic collagen prosthesis might be favorable compared to other replacement materials while treating prosthetic graft infections.

Hence, we aimed to assess the effect of complex vascular anatomy on silent new ischemic cerebral lesions in carotid artery stenting procedures. Methods We prospectively evaluated 122 patients (mean age: 69.5 +/- 7.1 years, male:83) who underwent carotid artery stenting for carotid artery revascularization. The patients having symptomatic transient ischemic attack or stroke after carotid artery stenting were excluded. The presence of a new hyperintense lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging without any neurological findings was considered as the SNICL. Patients were classified into two groups as DWI-positive and DWI-negative patients. Results Among the study population, 32 patients (26.2%) had SNICLs. The DWI-positive group had a significantly higher common carotid artery (CCA)-internal carotid artery (ICA) angle, older age, more frequent history of stroke, a higher proportion of type III aortic arch, and longer fluoroscopy time than the DWI-negative group. High CCA-ICA angle was identified as one of the independent predictors of SNICL (OR (odds ratio) = 1.103 95%CI (confidence interval): (1.023-1.596); p = 0.034), and CCA-ICA angle higher than 34.5 degrees predicted SNICL with a sensitivity of 62.5% and a specificity of 62.2% (area under the curve: 0.680; 95% CI: 0.570 to 0.789; p = 0.003). Conclusions The higher CCA-ICA angle may predict pre-procedure SNICL risk in carotid artery stenting and may have clinical value in the management of patients with carotid artery stenosis.

Comparing the efficacy of endovascular treatment for iliac vein compression syndrome with or without acute deep venous thrombosis: A single-center retrospective study	VASCULAR			English	Article						Endovascular treatment; iliac vein compression syndrome; deep venous thrombosis		Background To compare the efficacy of endovascular treatment for iliac vein compression syndrome (IVCS) with or without acute deep venous thrombosis of lower extremity. Methods This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 300 IVCS patients, who received endovascular treatment between January 2013 and December 2017. According to whether IVCS was complicated by deep venous thrombosis or not, these patients were divided into non-thrombotic iliac vein lesion group (NIVL group, n = 127) and post-thrombotic iliac vein lesion group (PIVL group, n = 173). After endovascular treatment, all patients were followed up to assess the symptoms improvement and to evaluate the patency of iliac vein. Results The technical success rate was 98% (294/300), and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting was adopted in 294 cases. The incidence of perioperative complications was 36.33% (109/300), but no severe complications occurred. During a mean follow-up of 22.3 months (range 6-30 months), 9(6.82%, 9/132) patients in PIVL group had recurrence of deep venous thrombosis, but nobody had deep venous thrombosis and varicose veins recurrence in NIVL group. The effective rate of endovascular treatment in NIVL group and PIVL group was 96.88% and 90.15% (P = 0.050), while the cumulative primary patency of iliac vein in NIVL group was significantly higher than that in PIVL group (P = 0.008). Conclusions The endovascular treatment is an effective, feasible, safe method for treating IVCS. There is no difference in the efficacy of IVCS patients with or without deep venous thrombosis, but the medium and long-term patency of patients with deep venous thrombosis is lower than that in patients without deep venous thrombosis.

However, it is controversial whether patients with severe contralateral carotid stenosis or occlusion (SCSO) can benefit from carotid endarterectomy surgery. This study aimed to estimate the SCSO effects on early outcomes after carotid endarterectomy with selective shunting. Methods Between August 2011 and October 2019, a total of 617 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy with selective shunting were analyzed. SCSO was defined as >70% luminal narrowing of the contralateral extracranial carotid stenosis or occlusion. Of these patients, 116 were categorized into an SCSO group while the rest were assigned to the non-SCSO group. Primary study outcomes were the occurrence of major adverse events, defined as stroke, all-cause mortality, and myocardial infarction during the perioperative period after carotid endarterectomy. Traditional multivariable logistic regression model and logistic regression model adjusted for propensity scores were used to estimate the SCSO effects on primary outcomes. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted according to age, sex, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes), preoperative neurological deficit, preoperative symptoms, and shunt use. Results Mean age was 68.5 +/- 9.2 years (86.1% men). Overall major adverse events rate within 30 days was 2.5%. Major adverse events rates in SCSO and non-SCSO groups were 9.5% and 1.6%, respectively. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). In multivariable regression analysis, patients with SCSO had a higher risk of major adverse events (non-SCSO vs. SCSO: aOR 5.05 [95% CI, 1.78-14.55]). In 342 propensity score matched patients, results were consistent (propensity score: aOR, 3.78 [95% CI, 1.13-12.64]). Conclusions SCSO is an independent predictor of 30-day major adverse events. Whether these patients with SCSO are suitable for carotid endarterectomy should be carefully considered.

"Classical" antibodies directed against proteinase 3 are involved in the pathogenesis and are part of the GPA diagnosis at the same time. Along with them, however, antibodies against Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein-2 (LAMP-2) and antibodies directed against plasminogen have been described in GPA. Objectives and methodology: We performed a cross-sectional study enrolling 34 patients diagnosed with GPA. Our study was aimed at looking for correlations between serum levels of LAMP-2 and plasminogen and the clinical manifestations of the GPA. Furthermore, we examined serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and its associated indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), as well as we looked for a correlation between these cytokines and the clinical manifestations of GPA. Results The results showed that in GPA, serum plasminogen levels were negatively associated with renal involvement (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78) (95% CI 0.53-0.91), p = 0.035, and the extent of proteinuria, Spearman's Rho = -0.4, p = 0.015. Increased levels of TNF-alpha and IDO correlated with disease activity, Spearman's Rho =0.62, p = 0.001 and Spearman's Rho = 0.4, p = 0.022, respectively, whereas only TNF-alpha was increased in severe forms of GPA with lung involvement (ROC AUC of 0.8) (95% CI 0.66-0.94), p = 0.005. Conclusions In this study, we demonstrate the alteration of soluble factors, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of GPA and their relationship with the clinical manifestations of the disease. Our main results confirm the associations of increased secretory TNF-alpha and some clinical manifestations, and we describe for the first time decreased serum plasminogen levels and their association with renal involvement.

However, aneurysms involving the ileocolic arterial branch of the superior mesenteric artery are extremely rare.

Methods We confirmed the diagnosis of ileocolic arterial aneurysm, which showed the characteristic "string-of-beads" appearance of the distal main trunk of the superior mesenteric artery on angiography. We performed endovascular coil embolization for the aneurysm, and for both the inflow and outflow vessels. After confirming that the aneurysm was no longer visible, the treatment was completed. Results There were no clinical findings suspicious of ischemic enteritis or intestinal necrosis after embolization. We confirmed that the ileocolic arterial aneurysm was not observed on computed tomography angiography one month after treatment. Conclusions While development of an ileocolic arterial aneurysm associated with segmental arterial mediolysis is very rare, it is at a high risk of sudden rupture. Therefore, coil embolization is a useful intervention in such patients and can be implemented based on the size and morphology of the aneurysm.

Physician-modified fenestrated endovascular repair of type 1A endoleaks from polymer-based low-profile endografts	VASCULAR			English	Article						Fenestrated endovascular aortic repair; type 1A endoleak; proximal failure; Ovation system; polymer-based proximal seal; endovascular aortic aneurysm repair; physician-modified endovascular graft		Purpose There have been increasing number of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair performed in hostile necks using newer generation technology including polymer-based proximal sealing devices such as the Ovation system. Unique design features of the device can pose challenges during endovascular salvage of type 1A endoleak. We describe two cases of successful application of physician-modified fenestrated endografting, in order to repair type 1A endoleaks following endovascular aortic aneurysm repair with ovation system. Technique In both cases, multi-fenestrated endografts were custom-modified using preloaded wire technique on Cook Zenith Alpha thoracic stent grafts at the back table. Under general anesthesia, left brachial cut down and a single percutaneous femoral access were performed. Staggered deployment of fenestrated endograft, accompanied by sequential catheterization of target vessels, facilitated correct alignment of fenestrated endograft. Infolding of fenestrated endograft inside the Ovation main body resulted in leg claudication, and repaired with balloon expandable covered tent. Prophylactic deployment of balloon expandable covered stent was performed in the second case. Both cases showed resolution of type 1A endoleak. Conclusion Fenestrated endovascular repair is feasible for proximal failure of Ovation endografts. Careful planning and advanced skill set in complex endovascular aortic repair are required, as well as detailed knowledge of the failed endografts.

Our aim is to evaluate the prognostic value of objective nutritional indexes indicating malnutrition, in patients underwent endovascular aortic replacement. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 149 consecutive patients who underwent technically successful endovascular aortic replacement operation between October 2010 and August 2019. Objective nutritional indexes, prognostic nutritional index, geriatric nutritional risk index and controlling nutritional status, scores were calculated using the preoperative data. Optimal cut-off values were obtained by receiver operating characteristic analysis. According to the cut-off values, we investigated the relationship between indexes and the long-term all-cause mortality. Results During mean 48.0 +/- 30.3 months follow-up duration, in 47 of patients (31.5%), all-cause mortality were documented. In mortality group, prognostic nutritional index (42.8 +/- 7.1 vs 51.3 +/- 5.2,p < 0.001) and geriatric nutritional risk index (100.7 +/- 10.1 vs 107.6 +/- 9.2,p < 0.001) were significantly lower, controlling nutritional status score (2.0 (1.0-4.0) vs 1.0 (0.0-2.0),p < 0.001) was higher when compared to survivor group. Kaplan-Meier curves presented higher mortality incidence in malnutrition patients evaluated with objective nutritional indexes (Log-rang test, for all three indexesp < 0.001). Besides Cox-proportional hazard analysis showed all three nutritional indexes may be a predictive marker for all-cause mortality, prognostic nutritional index introduced more valuable data than other two indexes. Conclusions Malnutrition is associated with significant increase in postoperative long-term mortality in endovascular aortic replacement patients. Preoperatively calculated objective nutritional indexes especially prognostic nutritional index can be used as an important prognostic tool.

J	Smith, J; Joseph, S; Thoo, C				Smith, Julian; Joseph, Simon; Thoo, Catherine			Zenith AAA endovascular graft suprarenal bare metal stent separation with graft migration and type IA endoleak	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Endovascular; stent separation; type 1A endoleak; EVAR; Zenith	ANEURYSM REPAIR	Background The Zenith endovascular graft (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) is a well-recognised device used in endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR). After a small number of reported cases of suprarenal stent separation from the main body of the graft, modifications were made to the strength and durability of the suture line attachment of the proximal bare metal component prior to release in 2003. This report describes a further case of suprarenal stent separation and type IA endoleak in a patient who underwent an EVAR using the Zenith device in 2012. Methods We present a case report of a 77-year-old male with incidental finding of type IA endoleak on a background of elective endovascular repair for 50.4-mm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), with a Cook Zenith endograft. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated separation of the suprarenal bare metal stent from the main body of the endograft, with resultant graft migration and increase in native aneurysm sac size. Results The patient underwent semi-urgent surgery with successful placement of a bridging thoracic stent graft between the lowest renal artery and main body of the pre-existing graft. Conclusions This case report describes a rare complication of Zenith devices, additionally emphasising the importance of regular surveillance imaging following EVAR.

Results from the Ibero-Latin American acute arterial thrombosis registry in COVID-19: (ARTICO-19)	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Acute limb ischemia; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; peripheral thrombosis; Ibero-America	VASCULAR-SURGERY; EXPERIENCE; DISEASE	Objective Few studies have focused on arterial thrombosis and acute limb ischemia in COVID-19. This international registry intended to study the spectrum of clinical characteristics, therapeutic trends, and outcomes in a cohort of Ibero-Latin American patients with arterial thrombosis or acute limb ischemia and COVID-19. Methods Data were retrospectively obtained from 21 centers in 9 countries. Patients with proven COVID-19 and asymptomatic or symptomatic arterial thrombosis were included. COVID-19 diagnosis was established by RT-PCR assay or IgM serology plus suggestive clinical/radiographical findings. We recorded and analyzed variables related to demography, clinical presentation, therapeutic trends, and outcomes. Results Eighty one patients were included in the registry. In 38.3%, acute limb ischemia symptoms were the first manifestation of COVID-19. Non-surgical management was more frequent in severe cases than surgical interventions, 11.1% vs. 88.9%, respectively (p = 0.004). Amputation rates were similar between all COVID severity groups (p = 0.807). Treatment was classified as non-surgical, open surgical, and endovascular treatment. Further analysis revealed an equal frequency of major leg amputation between treatment groups and increased mortality in patients with non-surgical management. However, multivariate regression analysis showed that treatment choices are associated with disease severity, with significant non-surgical treatment in critical patients; thus, mortality is related to the severity and confounds treatment analysis. Conclusion Arterial thrombosis can be the initial symptom of a patient presenting with COVID-19. Physicians and health workers should potentially suspect COVID-19 in acute ischemia cases without a known risk factor or embolic cause. More experimental and clinical research is required to understand the complex phenomenon of arterial COVID-19 induced coagulopathy fully.

Method A total of 39 consecutive patients with carotid artery lesions treated with covered stent grafts at our institution from December 2016 to December 2019 were reviewed. Two kinds of stent including self-expandable covered stent (Viabahn; W. L. Gore & Associates) and balloon-expandable covered stent (Willis; Microport) were applied. The angiograms immediately after the procedure, perioperative complications, and follow-up outcomes were recorded. Result Based on imaging features, 11 patients exhibited pseudoaneurysms, 23 patients had blood blister-like aneurysms (BBAs), and five patients were carotid cavernous fistulas. A total of 40 stent implantations were performed, including nine Viabahn stents and 31 Willis stents. Two patients received double implants of Willis stents. Stent failed to perform for one patient due to tortuous parent artery. The angiography reports immediately after the procedure showed that the lesions in 36 patients were completely occluded, whereas two patients had minimal endoleaks. With respect to the occurrence of procedural complications, an aneurysm ruptured during the procedure in one case, which resulted in CCF, and acute in-stent thrombosis occurred in another case. Clinical and angiographic follow-up (11.2 +/- 2.4 months) sessions were conducted for 38 patients and a complete lesion exclusion was achieved in 36 patients. The minimal endoleak persisted in one patient and another patient experienced recurrence with stent migration, leading to ipsilateral blepharoptosis. However, none of the patients developed hemorrhage or ischemia and in-stent stenosis was not observed. Conclusion Covered stent grafts appear to be a safe and feasible for the treatment of complex carotid artery lesions. Despite the potential for stent delivery failure as well as endoleak and procedure-related complications, covered stent grafts should be considered when selecting the optimal treatment strategy.

A comparison of endovascular versus open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm - Meta-analysis of propensity score-matched data	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm; propensity; propensity-matched data; open repair; endovascular aneurysm repair	RANDOMIZED-TRIALS; OUTCOMES; TIME	Background Optimal management of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA) has been heavily debated in the literature. The aim of this review is to assess comparative outcomes from propensity-matched studies of endovascular versus open for rAAA. Methods Electronic databases (MEDLINE and Embase) were searched in January 2021 using the Healthcare Databases Advanced Search interface. Eligible studies compared endovascular versus open repair for rAAA using propensity-matched cohorts. Pooled estimates of perioperative outcomes were calculated using odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using the random-effects model. Time-to-event data meta-analysis was conducted using the inverse-variance method and reported as summary hazard ratio (HR) and associated 95% CI. The quality of evidence was graded using a system developed by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. Results Six studies published between 2010 and 2020 were selected for qualitative and quantitative synthesis, reporting a total of 6731 patients. The odds of perioperative mortality after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) were significantly lower than after open surgical repair (OSR) (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.41-0.65). The hazard of overall mortality during follow-up was lower, although not significantly, after EVAR than after OSR (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62-1.01). The odds of acute kidney injury and early aneurysm-related reintervention were both significantly lower after EVAR than after OSR (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.78 and OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.98, respectively). Patients treated with EVAR stayed in hospital for significantly less time than those treated with OSR (MD -5.13, 95% CI -7.94 to -2.32). The certainty of the body of evidence for perioperative mortality was low and for overall mortality was very low. Conclusion The evidence suggests that EVAR confers a significant benefit on perioperative mortality.

The available diagnostic methods are mostly used to measure and visualize blood flow and are not useful in the evaluation of perfusion, especially in diabetic patients, which is now considered to be a research priority by most of the vascular societies around the world as this is still a relatively poorly studied phenomenon. Objective The aim of this review is to explore the clinical significance of muscle tissue oxygenation monitoring in lower-extremity peripheral artery disease diagnosis using the near-infrared spectroscopy method. Methods A systematic search in PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases was performed to identify clinical near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) studies in English and Russian, published until September 2019, involving muscle tissue oxygenation in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The manuscripts were reviewed by two researchers independently and scored on the quality of the research using MINORS criteria. Results After screening 443 manuscripts, 23 studies (n = 1580) were included. NIRS-evaluated recovery time seems to be more accurate than ankle-brachial index in diabetic patients to differentiate between moderate and severe claudication. Consistent findings across all the included studies showed that both the oxygenation and deoxygenation rates as well as the recovery times varied from patient to patient and therefore were not suitable for standardization. Conclusions The clinical relevance of routine use of NIRS to diagnose PAD is unproven; therefore, its use is not currently part of standard-of-care for patients with PAD since the absolute values seem to vary significantly, depending on the outside conditions. More data need to be provided on the possible use of NIRS monitoring intraoperatively where the conditions can be more controlled.

Methods This is a prospective, single center, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial that randomized (1:1) 60 patients (38 men; mean age 68.7 +/- 8.8) to drug-coated balloon group (n = 30) or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty group (n = 30). The primary efficacy endpoint was primary patency of the target lesion and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) at 12 months. The primary safety end point was freedom from perioperative death at 30 days and freedom from limb-related death and major amputation at 12 months. Results Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Drug-coated balloon group resulted in higher primary patency (82.8% vs. 48.3%, p = 0.005) and lower CD-TLR rates (3.5% vs. 27.6%; p = 0.001) versus percutaneous transluminal angioplasty group at 12 months. The ABI was significantly higher in drug-coated balloon group than percutaneous transluminal angioplasty group (0.86 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.72 +/- 0.18, p = 0.025). There were no perioperative death at 30 days, no limb-related death and no major amputation at 12 months in either group. Conclusions The randomized controlled trial showed superior treatment effect with drug-coated balloon versus percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, with remarkably higher patency and lower CD-TLR rates. The result is consistent with other study and demonstrates the safety and efficacy of the Orchid drug-coated balloon for the treatment of femoropopliteal artery disease.

J	Antunes, LF; Botelho, M; Fonseca, M				Antunes, Luis F.; Botelho, Mafalda; Fonseca, Manuel			Extracorporeal sheath shunt technique in trauma: A different vascular shunt in civilian trauma	VASCULAR			English	Article						Intravascular; shunt; trauma		Background/Objective Temporary intravascular shunts are widely used in military surgery, representing a bridging until definitive vascular reconstruction. In civilian practice, shunts are mainly used as damage control and as a temporary measure until orthopaedic fixation. The objective of this report is to illustrate a new approach to the temporary restoration of perfusion during open management of extremity arterial injury. Methods The authors present a technique that uses sheaths introducers, instead of commercial or purpose-built shunts, which can be used through surgical or percutaneous approaches. Three clinical cases are presented where this technique was performed. Results/Conclusion: In the presented cases, this technique reduced time of shunt construction by avoiding artery surgical approach. This technique can facilitate the creation of an intravascular shunt among other than vascular surgeons.

Methods We reported a 61-year-old man presenting with multiple organ failure rapidly after right lower limb swelling. Computed tomography angiography showed an ilio-iliac arteriovenous fistula caused by right common iliac artery aneurysm, and venous thrombosis of bilateral common iliac veins. A bifurcated stent-graft with coil embolization of right internal iliac artery was used for repair. Results The patient recovered rapidly and was discharged without complications. Although arteriovenous fistula persisted due to type II endoleak, aneurysm sac and inferior vena cava significantly shrunk at six months follow-up. Conclusions This report demonstrated that multiple organ failure may appear when the distal outflow tracts of arteriovenous fistula are obstructed. Moreover, endovascular repair is effective for reversal of multiple organ failure caused by arteriovenous fistula, even if arteriovenous fistula persists due to type II endoleak.

J	Lall, A; Yavagal, DR; Bornak, A				Lall, Alex; Yavagal, Dileep R.; Bornak, Arash			Chronic total occlusion and spontaneous recanalization of the internal carotid artery: Natural history and management strategy	VASCULAR			English	Review						Internal carotid occlusion; carotid dissection; spontaneous recanalization; carotid thrombosis; carotid endarterectomy; stroke	ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; TISSUE-PLASMINOGEN-ACTIVATOR; INTRAVENOUS THROMBOLYSIS; ENDOVASCULAR THERAPY; CT ANGIOGRAPHY; ENDARTERECTOMY; PREVENTION; SURGERY; METAANALYSIS; DISSECTION	Objectives Spontaneous recanalization of a chronic total occlusion of the extra-cranial internal carotid artery is an under-reported clinical entity. This paper reviews the different etiologies of internal carotid artery occlusion, its natural course, as well as the significance and our recommendations for the management of spontaneous internal carotid artery recanalization. Methods A review of literature on etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of internal carotid artery occlusion and recanalization was conducted. PubMed database was searched using the terms "internal carotid occlusion" and "recanalization". Articles were reviewed and studies involving the management of internal carotid artery occlusion and spontaneous recanalization were included. We subsequently developed a management algorithm for chronic total occlusion of the internal carotid artery and spontaneous recanalization of such lesions based on the available evidence. Results Common etiologies of chronic total occlusion of the internal carotid artery include carotid atherosclerotic disease, cardioembolic, and carotid dissection. Progression of an asymptomatic to symptomatic occlusion is estimated at 2-8% annually. Well-compensated patients can be asymptomatic. In others, clinical symptoms range from ipsilateral or global hypoperfusion to embolic stroke in some cases of spontaneous recanalization. Spontaneous recanalization occurs in 2.3-10.3% of patients but rarely results in a cerebrovascular event. Conclusions Progression of an asymptomatic chronic total occlusion of the internal carotid artery to symptomatic is infrequent. The management algorithm of chronic total occlusion of the internal carotid artery and spontaneous recanalization of the internal carotid artery must be tailored to the patient based on symptoms, etiology of the lesion, imaging findings, surgical risk, and reliability for follow-up.

Paclitaxel exposure and long-term mortality of patients treated with the Zilver PTX drug-eluting stent	VASCULAR			English	Article						Endovascular; peripheral arterial disease; paclitaxel; drug-eluting stents; mortality	COATED BALLOON; FEMOROPOPLITEAL	Objectives Paclitaxel-eluting stents have demonstrated improved patency over balloon angioplasty and bare metal stenting for endovascular interventions in the femoral-popliteal segment. Recently, concerns have arisen regarding the safety of paclitaxel use and its association with mortality. This study aims to examine real-world, long-term mortality, and patency of patients treated with the Zilver PTX drug-eluting stent. Methods Patients treated with the PTX stent after FDA approval between 2013 and 2015 were identified from an institutional database. Demographic, procedural, and device information was collected and initial- and lifetime-exposure dose of paclitaxel was calculated. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and its association with paclitaxel exposure. Long-term patency was also evaluated. Results Seventy-nine procedures involving PTX placement were performed on 64 individual patients during the study period, with 15 (23.4%) having bilateral procedures. Average age was 70 years, and 71.9% were male. Forty-five patients (70.3%) were claudicants, and 19 (29.7%) had chronic, limb-threatening ischemia. An average of 2.3 PTX stents, totaling 203 mm in length, were placed per procedure. Paclitaxel exposure was 1.87 mg/procedure initially (range 0.38-4.03 mg), and average lifetime exposure was 4.65 mg/patient (range 0.38-27.91 mg). Average follow-up was 59.6 months. Kaplan-Meier estimated survival was 96.9%, 81.2% and 71.7% at one , three, and five years. On multivariate analysis, no specific factors were associated with overall morality including initial paclitaxel dose (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00) and lifetime paclitaxel exposure (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89-1.08). Kaplan-Meier primary patency was 76.2%, 60.1%, and 29.3% at one, two, and five years, respectively. Secondary patency was 92.2%, 85.4%, and 75.2% at the same intervals. Conclusions At a mean follow-up of five years, exposure to higher doses of paclitaxel from Zilver PTX does not appear to be associated with increased mortality compared to lower doses in real-world patients. Long-term patency rates confirm the efficacy of Zilver PTX, and further investigation may be warranted before abandoning paclitaxel use altogether.

Endografts with mini-cuff-augmented fenestrations for endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aortic and common iliac artery aneurysms	VASCULAR			English	Article						Aortic aneurysm; endovascular technique; endovascular aortic repair; endograft; stent-graft; stents; common iliac artery; internal iliac artery		Objective To report a technique of creating mini-cuff-augmented fenestrations in endografts for use in endovascular aneurysm repair. Methods Circular fenestrations are made in Dacron thoracic (Valiant Captivia, Medtronic) or tapered iliac limb (Endurant, Medtronic) endografts using thermal cautery and the edges are strengthened with radio-opaque wire sutured on with 6-0 polypropylene. Straight thin-wall expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular graft of the same diameter as the fenestration is affixed to its edge with nonlocking 5-0 polypropylene suture, everted, trimmed, balloon-dilated to its nominal diameter and prevented from invaginating by relaxed external stay sutures. Mini-cuff-augmented fenestrations are often pre-cannulated with looped or externalized nitinol guidewires to facilitate catheter crossing. Successful use of mini-cuff-augmented fenestrations is illustrated in a symptomatic patient with Crawford extent-3 thoracoabdominal aortic and bilateral common iliac artery aneurysm undergoing endovascular repair. Seven mini-cuff-augmented fenestrations were created to preserve flow into five visceral arteries (celiac, superior mesenteric, left and dual right renal; all arising from the aneurysm) and both internal iliac arteries (arising at the aneurysm edge). Results Effective sealing was achieved immediately at all mini-cuff-augmented fenestrations. At 6-month follow-up there were no endoleaks, all fenestration stents were patent and undistorted, and the aneurysm sac size had decreased. Conclusion Mini-cuff-augmented fenestrations accomplish effective fenestration sealing, despite being in aneurysmal zones, while preserving the advantages of fenestrations over cuffed branches.

Our study aimed to determine whether pioglitazone combined with atorvastatin can restrain the progression of atherosclerosis and promote plaque stabilization in a rabbit model Method and Result Thirty rabbits were randomly divided into an atherosclerosis group, an atorvastatin group, and an atorvastatin plus pioglitazone group. The atherosclerosis model was induced using balloon injury and feeding a high-fat diet. Plasma samples were then used to analyze glucose, triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). The area percentage of atherosclerotic plaques was analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The relative reductions in TG and LDL-C and the increase in HDL-C levels were significantly greater in the combination therapy group than in the atorvastatin monotherapy group (TG: -33.60 +/- 7.17% vs -24.16 +/- 8.04%, p < 0.001; LDL-C: -42.89 +/- 1.63% vs -37.13 +/- 1.35%, p < 0.001; and HDL-C: 25.18 +/- 5.53% vs 10.43 +/- 6.31%, p < 0.001). The relative reductions in hs-CRP and MMP-9 levels were significantly greater in the combination therapy group than in the atorvastatin monotherapy group (-69.38 +/- 1.06% vs-53.73 +/- 1.92%, p < 0.001; -32.77 +/- 2.49% vs -13.36 +/- 1.66%, p < 0.001). The area percentage of atherosclerotic plaques was significantly smaller in the atorvastatin group (47.75%, p < 0.05) and in the atorvastatin plus pioglitazone group (22.57%, p < 0.05) than in the atherosclerosis group (84.08%, p < 0.05) Conclusion We can thus conclude that the combination treatment of atorvastatin and pioglitazone provided additive benefits on inflammatory parameters and lipid metabolism. Pioglitazone combined with atorvastatin can further restrain the progression of atherosclerosis and promote plaque stabilization in a rabbit model.

Methods Between January 2014 and December 2014, 153 diabetic patients with foot wounds underwent peripheral angiography. Final foot angiograms were used to allocate patients according to pedal arch: complete pedal arch (CPA), incomplete pedal arch (IPA), and absent pedal arch (APA). Five-year survival and limb salvage rates were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves and compared by means of Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test. Associations of patient and procedure variables with overall survival and limb salvage outcomes were sought with univariate and multivariate analyses. Results A below-the-knee (BTK) artery was the target vessel in 80 cases (52.3%). Five-year Kaplan-Meier rates of survival were similar in all groups (p = 0.1): CPA 30%, IPA 27.5%, and APA 26.4%. Five-year limb salvage rates were significantly better in patients with CPA/IPA (p < 0.001): CPA 95.1%, IPA 94.3%, and APA 67.3%. In the whole population study, multivariate analysis showed significant association of smoking (p = 0.01), chronic renal failure (p = 0.02), and severity of foot wounds (p < 0.001) with survival. Coronary artery disease (p = 0.03), severity of foot wounds (p = 0.001), and pedal arch status (p = 0.05) showed strong association with limb salvage. Conclusions Pedal arch quality significantly affected limb salvage but not survival at 5 years in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. Smoking, chronic renal failure, and severity of foot wounds affected overall survival, whilst coronary artery disease, and severity of foot wounds limb salvage.

Methods Relevant databases were searched for studies published from 2000 to June 2020 on SMVT treated with conservative treatment, surgical treatment, or endovascular approach. Different treatment types were grouped for analysis and comparison, and odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated. The outcomes were pooled using meta-analytic methods and presented by forest plots. Results Eighteen articles, including eight on SMVT patients treated with endovascular therapies, were enrolled. The treatment effectiveness was compared between different groups according to the change of symptoms, the occurrence of complications, and mortality as well. The conservative treatment group had better efficacy compared to the surgery group (89.0% vs. 78.6%, P <0.05), and the one-year survival rate was also higher (94.4% vs. 80.0%, P >0.05), but without statistical significance. As for endovascular treatment, the effectiveness was significantly higher than the surgery group (94.8% vs. 75.2%, P <0.05), and the conservative treatment group as well (93.3% vs. 86.3%, P >0.05), which still requires further research for the lack of statistical significance. Conclusions Present findings indicate that anticoagulation, as conservative treatment should be the preferred clinical option in the clinic for SMVT, due to its better curative effect compared to other treatment options, including lower mortality, fewer complications, and better prognosis. Moreover, endovascular treatment is a feasible and promising approach that is worth in-depth research, for it is less invasive than surgery and has relatively better effectiveness, thus can provide an alternative option for SMVT treatment and may be considered as a reliable method in clinical.

We aimed to investigate the incidence, predictors, and impact of management strategies on six-month readmission in patients with critical limb ischemia. Methods A secondary analysis of the Nationwide Readmissions Database (2016-2017) was conducted. Propensity score matching was performed for subgroup analysis. Results We identified 50,058 patients with primary diagnosis of critical limb ischemia. Six-month all-cause and critical limb ischemia-related readmission rate was 52.36% and 10.86%, respectively. The risk of all-cause readmission was lower with amputation but was similar among other subgroups. Patients receiving surgical [HR 0.62, CI(0.48-0.79), p < 0.001] and hybrid procedure [HR 0.65 (0.46-0.93), p = 0.02] had lower risk of unplanned critical limb ischemia-related readmission compared to endovascular, though the risk of unplanned revascularization/amputation during readmission was similar between the three strategies. The risk of non-critical limb ischemia-related readmission was higher with surgical [HR 1.13, CI(1.04-1.23), p = 0.003] and hybrid procedure [HR 1.17, CI(1.08-1.28), p < 0.001], driven by increased procedure-related/wound complications. Eventhough endovascular patients were older with more severe critical limb ischemia presentation, a lower proportion received home-health or placement upon discharge from index-admission. This could account for higher readmission without higher repeat revascularization in endovascular group. Conclusion The risk of critical limb ischemia and non-critical limb ischemia-related readmission differ according to the management strategy. Significant differences in discharge disposition exist depending on revascularization strategy. Study findings identify opportunities for reducing readmissions by focusing on nonprocedural aspects like wound-care, discharge planning and placement.

The pathogenesis of its formation remains unclear. We present the efficacy of left common iliac vein recanalization in acquired arteriovenous fistula treatment. Methods A 71-year-old man presented with severe lower left limb edema and was diagnosed with acquired arteriovenous fistula following iliac vein thrombosis. Treatment by recanalizing the left common iliac vein with bare stents was selected over embolizing the arteriovenous fistula, leading to an excellent clinical outcome. Results and Conclusions: Acquired arteriovenous fistula should be considered in some patients with post-thrombotic syndrome. Endovascular recanalization without embolization of the arteriovenous fistula can effectively treat iliac vein thrombosis associated with arteriovenous fistula.

We assessed predictors of in-stent restenosis in patients with long-segment superficial femoral artery disease and hypothesized that pre-procedural ultrasound assessment would predict in-stent restenosis. Methods This single-center study retrospectively analyzed 283 limbs in 243 patients who treated with superficial femoral artery nitinol stent placement for long-segment (>= 15 cm) lesions between 2015 and 2018. Color duplex ultrasound was performed pre-procedure and post-procedure at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. The endpoint was >= 50% in-stent restenosis in the superficial femoral artery. Primary patency rates were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and compared using the log-rank test. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the risk factors for in-stent restenosis. Results The median length of lesions was 25.8 +/- 8.1 cm. The cumulative freedom from >= 50% in-stent restenosis at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months was 95.3%, 78.3%, 56.0%, 30.6%, and 15.9%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that cumulative lesion length >= 25 cm (hazard ratio 1.681; p = 0.003), calcified plaque (hazard ratio 1.549, p = 0.006), poor runoff scores >10 (hazard ratio 1.870, p = 0.003), and chronic renal failure (hazard ratio 2.075, p = 0.009) were independent risk factors for in-stent restenosis. The agreement rate between ultrasound and angiography was 92.6% for cumulative lesion length (kappa 0.851) and 91.9% for runoff score (kappa 0.872). Conclusions The results indicate that pre-procedural color duplex ultrasound evaluation is helpful for the selection of appropriate candidates for superficial femoral artery stent placement. Cumulative lesion length >= 25 cm, plaque calcification, poor distal runoff, and chronic renal failure independently predicted in-stent restenosis.

Methods From August 2017 to June 2018, three patients with zone 2 aortic lesions underwent thoracic endovascular repair with innominate artery, left common carotid artery, and left subclavian artery recannulation using pre-fenestration and branched stent-grafts to preserve the patency of the aortic arch branches. Results The technical success rate was 100%. One patient had a proximal type I endoleak with no need for additional treatment. The overall mortality was 0%. All branches were patent. The follow-up period lasted for 2-15 months, with one patient lost to follow-up. There were no conversions to open surgical repair, aortic rupture, paraplegia, or retrograde type A aortic dissection. Conclusion The use of a pre-fenestration and branch stent-graft for the thoracic endovascular repair of zone 2 aortic lesions is a feasible and effective method for aortic arch branch revascularization. The risk of this surgical procedure is high, requiring significant expertise. The procedure should be conducted only in experienced centers.

This issue was addressed by very few randomized controlled studies. This topic has recently re-emerged with the advent of the endovascular fistula creation using the side-to-side technique. Objectives: To compare the results of both surgical techniques for the creation of arteriovenous anastomosis. Methods This is a randomized controlled prospective study. All renal failure patients, 18 years and older, referred to our institution requiring creation of a new arm arteriovenous fistulas, including distal radio-cephalic, ulno-basilic, proximal brachio-cephalic or brachio-basilic configurations were included. Results Between February 2018 and October 2018, 378 patients underwent creation of permanent haemodialysis access. A total of 100 patients were randomized equally into the end-to-side and side-to-side groups. Follow-up for the study purpose continued until May 2019 (mean = 9 months, range 1-12). Patients' age ranged from 19 to 68 years. Sevety-seven arteriovenous fistulas were created at the elbow (37 brachio-basilic and 40 brachio-cephalic). Radio-cephalic fistulae were 23, created at wrist and in the forearm. Primary technical success was 97%, and 35 (70%) and 17 (34%) cases achieved functionally maturation in the end-to-side and side-to-side groups, respectively (P = 0.0001). Primary and secondary patency rates at 12 months were 76% end to side versus 78% STS (P = 0.381) and 84% end to side versus 86% STS (P = 0.225), respectively. Conclusion End-to-side technique should be used in all instances of arteriovenous fistulas creation.

While venography is considered the gold standard for assessing iliac veins, some have proposed that intravascular ultrasound should be utilized instead due to its greater sensitivity at detecting stenotic lesions. Routinely, our service uses both intravascular ultrasound and venography, but we have noted that some patients cannot tolerate dye due to allergy, renal insufficiency, or deemed high-risk by the interventionalist due to uncontrolled medical co-morbidities. This study aimed to investigate whether forgoing dye had an impact on iliac vein stent thrombosis. Methods From 2012 to 2016, 1482 iliac vein procedures (91 intravascular ultrasound-only and 1391 intravascular ultrasound plus venography) were performed on 992 patients who failed conservative treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. Our mean patient age was 65.8 years (range 21-99; SD +/- 14.3) with 347 male and 645 female patients. The clinical presenting symptoms per clinical-etiology-anatomy-pathophysiology classification for the intravascular ultrasound-only cohort were C1:0, C2:3, C3:31, C433, C5:5, C6:20 and for the intravascular ultrasound plus venography cohort were C1:0, C2:24, C3:566, C4:583, C5:30, C6:188. Stent thrombi that developed within or at 30 days of stenting were categorized as early and greater than 30 days as late. Transcutaneous duplex ultrasound classified stent thrombi as either partial or occlusive. Our average follow-up time was 19.4 months (0-42, SD +/- 12.5). Results A total of 2.2% intravascular ultrasound-only patients versus 2.75% intravascular ultrasound plus venogram patients developed early stent thrombosis,p = 0.35. Earlypartialstent thrombosis occurred in 1.1% of the intravascular ultrasound-only group versus 2.6% of the intravascular ultrasound plus venogram group,p = 0.38. Earlyocclusivestent thromboses occurred in 1.1% of intravascular ultrasound-only patients and 0.15% of intravascular ultrasound plus venogram patients,p = 0.06. Late stent thromboses developed in 4% of patients in the intravascular ultrasound-only cohort and 4% in the intravascular ultrasound plus venogram cohort,p = 0.97. Latepartialstent thromboses occurred in 2.7% of intravascular ultrasound-only patients versus 2.6% in intravascular ultrasound plus venogram patients,p = 0.99. Lateocclusivestent thromboses occurred in 1.3% of intravascular ultrasound-only patients versus 1.4% of intravascular ultrasound plus venogram patients,p = 0.95. Moreover, the formation ofanystent was 6.2% in the intravascular ultrasound-only versus 6.75% in the intravascular ultrasound plus venogram group,p = 0.55. Conclusion Results of our study show no significant difference in stent thrombosis between the intravascular ultrasound-only and intravascular ultrasound plus venogram cohorts. This concludes that using intravascular ultrasound alone is safe for iliac vein stenting.

New endografts were brought to the market specifically designed to accommodate severe neck angulation. Authors describe a preliminary experience and early results using the Gore Excluder Conformable endograft (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) and its active control system in severe neck angulation with a standardized technical approach to achieve precise deployment in this hostile anatomy. Methods From June 2019 to May 2020, five patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm and severe neck angulation (>= 70 degrees) were treated with the Gore Excluder Conformable endograft at two different centers. Deployment of this endograft in this kind of anatomy should be aggressive starting over the level of renal arteries due to risk of distal migration downward on the external curvature and difficulty in upward repositioning. Authors suggested a standard technique with a routine through-and-through axillary-femoral approach, using a floppy guidewire together with preventive cannulation of the lower renal artery if a short neck (<15 mm) is associated. Results Endovascular aortic procedures were successfully completed in all patients. Final deployment of the stent graft using our standardized technical approach was extremely precise in all cases even if redeployment of the graft was necessary in all cases. No other secondary procedures were needed. At 30 days, no type IA endoleak was recorded and no aneurysm-related secondary procedures were performed. Median follow-up for this group of patients was 5.2 months (range 1-11). Early results revealed no type IA endoleak and no migration at Ct angiogram. No aneurysm-related secondary procedures were required. Conclusion Routine use of through-and-through axillary-femoral guidewire associated with selective pre-cannulation of the lower renal artery allows a precise deployment of the Gore Excluder Conformable endograft in difficult anatomies possibly affecting early outcomes.

Drug-coated balloon angioplasty for the treatment of edge stenosis after self-expanding covered stent placement for superficial femoral artery occlusive disease	VASCULAR			English	Article						Drug-coated balloon; drug-eluting balloon; edge stenosis; Viabahn endoprosthesis; self-expanding covered stent; superficial femoral artery; peripheral artery disease	PACLITAXEL-ELUTING BALLOON; STANDARD BALLOON; RESTENOSIS; TRIAL; MULTICENTER; LESIONS; OUTCOMES; GRAFT	Background Edge stenoses are the predominant limitation of self-expanding covered stent treatment of superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease, necessitating reinterventions. Angioplasty of an edge stenosis is associated with a high recurrence rate. Drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatment of edge stenoses might improve outcomes by decreasing the incidence of restenosis. Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of using a DCB for the treatment of edge stenoses after self-expanding covered stent placement for SFA occlusive disease. Method We performed a retrospective analysis of patients treated with a DCB for edge stenoses after self-expanding covered stent placement. The primary endpoint was primary patency at one year. The secondary endpoints included procedure-related complications, secondary patency, and freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR). Results A total of 21 patients with 28 edge stenoses were included. The time from primary treatment to treatment of the edge stenosis was 19 months (interquartile range (IQR) 8; 52 months). Primary patency and assisted primary patency at one year were 66.7% with a secondary patency of 90.9%. Freedom from TLR was 86.1%, and freedom from clinically driven TLR was 89.4%. Four patients presented with a hemodynamically significant restenosis, and three of those patients had an occlusion. Median time to failure was six months (IQR 3.5; 7.0 months), and median time to occlusion was four months (IQR 3.0; 6.0 months). Conclusion The treatment of edge stenoses using a DCB is associated with a safe one-year outcome; however, this has to be confirmed in larger prospective studies.

Evaluating and understanding the rates and types of potential major complications of embolo-sclerotherapy of vascular malformations help treatment planning and informed consent. Therefore, this study reviewed major complications following embolo-sclerotherapy of all upper and lower extremity vascular malformations in a single specialized multidisciplinary vascular malformation center over a 5-year period. Methods All patients with vascular malformations underwent multidisciplinary directed intervention. Demographic, procedural, follow-up, and complication data were collected prospectively in a dedicated database, and reviewed retrospectively. Major complications for upper and lower extremity vascular malformations from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2017 were analyzed. All embolo-sclerotherapies of high-flow vascular malformations (HFVMs) were performed under selective catheter angiography and direct injection, but low-flow vascular malformations (LFVM) with direct injection only. Major complications were defined as any tissue or functional damage caused by direct injection, distal embolization, or tissue reaction. Results Seventy patients (median age of 25 years; 44 males and 26 females) had 150 embolo-sclerotherapy procedures for upper extremity vascular malformation. Of these, 28 patients had embolo-sclerotherapy for HFVM and 42 patients for LFVM; total 78 and 72 procedures, respectively. A total of 107 patients (median age of 26 years; 42 males and 65 females) had 160 embolo-sclerotherapy interventions for lower extremity vascular malformations. Of these, 18 patients had embolo-sclerotherapy for HFVM and 89 patients for LFVM; total of 30 and 130 procedures, respectively. The overall major complication rates following embolo-sclerotherapy of upper and lower extremity vascular malformations were 14.3% and 4.7%, respectively (P = 0.030). In the upper extremity HFVM group, major complications from embolo-sclerotherapy occurred in five patients; three ischemic fingers requiring amputation and two skin ulcerations. Meanwhile, in the upper extremity LFVM group, major complications occurred in five patients; one median nerve injury requiring nerve grafting and hand therapy, one hand contracture requiring tendon release, and three skin ulcerations. There was only one major complication, which was cellulitis in the lower extremity HFVM group. In the lower extremity LFVM group, major complications occurred in four patients; two skin ulcerations, one cellulitis, and one deep vein thrombosis. Conclusions Embolo-sclerotherapy is relatively safe for upper and lower extremity vascular malformations in a high-volume experienced center where our major complication rates were 14.3% and 4.7%, respectively, which compare favorably or similar to those reported in most recent literature. These outcomes will direct treatment strategies to avoid local and systemic toxic complications in the upper and lower extremity, for both HFVM and LFVM, and to improve informed consent.

Methods Transcriptional profiling was performed with Angiogenesis RT2 Profiler PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) array on three non-pathological and three arteriosclerotic vessels, followed by immunohistochemical staining. Based on these screening results, selected transcripts were employed for qPCR with specific primers and investigated on the blood RNA (RiboNucleic Acid) obtained from nine healthy controls and 29 patients with cardiovascular disorders. Thereafter, expression of these transcripts was investigated in vitro in human monocytes under calcification-mimicking conditions. Results and Conclusions Transcriptional profiling on the vessels revealed that out of 84 targets investigated two were up-regulated more than 100-fold, 18 more than 30 and 15 more than 10, while the most noticeable down-regulation was observed by ephrin-A3 and platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFA) genes. Based on the vessel results, investigations of the selected blood transcripts revealed that thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), thrombospondin 3 (THBS3), transforming growth factor, beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1), platelet-derived growth factor alpha, plasminogen activator, urokinase (PLAU) and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) were significantly elevated in cardiovascular blood as compared to corresponding controls. Induction of calcification-related conditions in vitro to human THP-1 monocytes led to noticeable modulation of these transcripts. Taken together, these data demonstrate that leucocytic THBS1, THBS3, TGFBR1, platelet-derived growth factor alpha, PLAU and PECAM-1 have a correlation with cardiovascular disorders and could be used as a supportive tool predicting development of this pathological condition.

However, perforations that occur in arterial side branches may be more challenging to manage. If bleeding persists, open surgery and fasciotomy may be required to evacuate the resulting hematoma and prevent compartment syndrome. These subsequent procedures increase morbidity and, if the angioplasty was performed in the outpatient setting, necessitate patient transfer to a hospital. To address these challenges, we describe a non-invasive hemostasis technique involving serial sphygmomanometer cuff inflations over the affected site in a series of five patients who experienced this complication at our office. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of consecutive patients undergoing lower extremity angioplasty that were found to have an arterial guidewire perforation on completion angiogram at our outpatient center between February 2012 and February 2017. Patients found to have iatrogenic guidewire perforations were administered intravenous protamine sulfate and were transferred to the surgical recovery room. Patients received ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain management. A blood pressure cuff was placed around the site of perforation, and patients received serial cuff inflation cycles with repeated examinations of both limbs until patients reported cessation of pain and there were no signs of a developing hematoma. Patients were observed for two hours before they were discharged home. A follow-up duplex ultrasound examination was completed within one week of the intervention. Results Over the course of five years, 536 angioplasties were performed at our outpatient office. Five of these patients experienced iatrogenic guidewire perforation (0.93%). Perforations occurred in branches of the anterior or posterior tibial artery. All of these patients were successfully managed with the aforementioned hemostasis technique. None of these patients required transfer to a hospital for further management, and no complications were reported at follow-up. Conclusions Complications of iatrogenic guidewire perforations in lower extremity arterial side branches can be safely and effectively managed by applying external compression around the affected site with an automatic blood pressure cuff.

Here we investigated the relationship between serum adiponectin levels and aortic stiffness in nondialysis diabetic kidney disease patients with stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease. Methods Fasting blood samples were obtained from 80 nondialysis diabetic kidney disease patients with stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) was measured using applanation tonometry; cfPWV values of >10 m/s were defined as aortic stiffness. Serum adiponectin levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay. Results Forty-two patients (52.5%) with nondialysis diabetic kidney disease were diagnosed with aortic stiffness. The patients in this group were older (p = 0.011), had higher systolic blood pressure (p = 0.002) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratios (p = 0.013), included fewer females (p = 0.024), and had lower serum adiponectin (p = 0.001) levels than those in the control group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that serum adiponectin was independently associated with aortic stiffness (odds ratio = 0.930, 95% confidence interval: 0.884-0.978, p = 0.005) and also positively correlated with cfPWV values by multivariable linear regression (beta = -0.309, p = 0.002) in nondialysis diabetic kidney disease patients. Conclusions The results suggested that serum adiponectin levels could be used to predict aortic stiffness in nondialysis diabetic kidney disease patients with stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease.

The functional vascular anatomy of the swine for research	VASCULAR			English	Review						Vascular anatomy; swine anatomy; porcine anatomy; vascular atlas; pig vasculature; pig anatomy		Objectives Swine (Sus Scrofa) are utilized broadly in research settings, given similarities to human vessel size and function; however, there are some important differences for clinicians to understand in order to interpret and perform translational research. This review article uses angiograms acquired in the course of a translational research program to present a description of the functional anatomy of the swine. Methods Digital subtraction angiography and computed tomography angiography were obtained throughout the course of multiple studies utilizing power injection with iodinated contrast. Subtracted two-dimensional images and three-dimensional multiplanar reformations were utilized post image acquisition to create maximal intensity projections and three-dimensional renderings of using open-source software (OsiriX). These imaging data are presented along with vessel measurements for reference. Results An atlas highlighting swine vascular anatomy, with an emphasis on inter-species differences that may influence how studies are conducted and interpreted, was compiled. Conclusions Swine are utilized in broad-reaching fields for preclinical research. While many similarities between human and swine vasculature exist, there are important differences to consider when conducting and interpreting research. This review article highlights these differences and presents accompanying images to inform clinicians gaining experience in swine research.

Methods The preoperative nutritional status of patients who underwent surgical reconstruction for ischemic tissue loss for the years 2011-2018 was retrospectively estimated using the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score. Patients were allocated to two groups: Group I, normal nutrition or mild malnutrition (CONUT score <= 4), and Group II, moderate-to-severe malnutrition (CONUT score >= 5). Wound healing was set as the primary endpoint and major amputation and death as the secondary endpoints. The wound healing, limb salvage, and overall survival rates were calculated after two years using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to determine which variables were independently associated with these outcomes. Results Forty-eight patients with missing values for the CONUT score were excluded. A total of 174 limbs in 147 patients were studied (Group I: 115 limbs in 100 patients; Group II: 59 limbs in 47 patients). The mean duration of the study was 519 +/- 270 days. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that wound healing in Group I was superior to that in Group II (Group I vs. II: two-year wound healing, 97% vs. 79%; time to 50% wound healing, 83 vs. 150 days, p < 0.001), and multivariate analysis showed that the CONUT score was an independent predictor of wound healing (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.98; p = 0.038). Conclusions Patients with better preoperative nutritional status are more likely to experience wound healing earlier than those with excessive malnutrition.

In order to improve the knowledge and treatment of this disease, a case of leiomyosarcoma in the femoral vein was reported. Methods We report the case of a 58-year-old woman with a leiomyosarcoma of the femoral vein and treated successfully by surgical resection. After surgery, no recurrence had been noted follow-up.Subsequently, we reviewed information derived from 31 previously published cases from 1954 to 2019. Results A total of 31 patients diagnosed with femoral vein leiomyosarcoma were presented in previous studies; in all of these patients, 14 (45.2%, 14/31) patients were men. Of these, the median age was 51.6 years old (ranging from 3 to 84). Conclusions Complete resection with adjuvant chemotherapeutic was the main strategy to treat the disease. Prognosis remains poor if metastasis was present, especially pulmonary metastasis.

However, few studies have evaluated its relation to long-term future ischemic stroke in hemodialysis patients. Therefore, we examined the relationship between ankle-brachial index and ischemic stroke events among hemodialysis patients in a seven-year follow-up. Methods A total of 84 patients were enrolled. Ankle-brachial index was assessed in January 2009. Primary outcomes included ischemic stroke. An ankle-brachial index < 0.9 was considered abnormal and 1.4 >= ankle-brachial index >= 0.9 to be normal ankle-brachial index. Results Mean values for ankle-brachial index were 0.98 +/- 0.21at study entrance. In addition, 28 patients encountered ischemic stroke in the seven-year follow-up. In univariate Cox regression analysis, old age (hazard ratio (HR): 1.065, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.030-1.102,p < 0.001), low seven-year averaged serum phosphate levels (HR: 0.473, 95% CI: 0.306-0.730,p = 0.001), and abnormal ankle-brachial index (HR: 0.035, 95% CI: 0.009-0.145,p < 0.001) were risk factors for ischemic stroke. In multivariate Cox regression analysis for significant variables in univariate analysis, abnormal ankle-brachial index (HR: 0.058, 95% CI: 0.012-0.279,p < 0.001) and low seven-year averaged serum phosphate levels (HR: 0.625, 95% CI: 0.404-0.968,p = 0.035) remained the risk factors for ischemic stroke. The risk of ischemic stroke was 3.783-fold in patients with abnormal ankle-brachial index compared with patients with normal ankle-brachial index (HR: 3.783, 95% CI: 1.731-8.269,p = 0.001). Conclusions These findings suggest that ankle-brachial index is an impressive predictor of future ischemic stroke among hemodialysis patients.

Mesenteric vascular disease: A population-based cohort study	VASCULAR			English	Article						Mesenteric vascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation; Scotland	CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; RISK-FACTORS; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ISCHEMIA; ARTERY; DEPRIVATION; MORTALITY; ENGLAND	Objectives Mesenteric vascular disease carries a high risk of mortality and morbidity; however, due to obscure clinical presentation, it can be under-recognized. Currently, epidemiology of mesenteric vascular disease remains poorly defined. The aim of this study is to analyze changes in Scottish mortality rates from mesenteric vascular disease overtime. Methods This is a retrospective, longitudinal population-based cohort study using data extracted from death certificates and Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. All deaths related to a vascular disorder of the intestines recorded as an underlying cause of death between 1979 and 2014 were identified using International Classification of Disease-9 or International Classification of Disease-10 code groups. Data included demographics and location of death. The residence postcodes were used to classify socio-economic status using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. Results From 2,142,921 deaths over 36 years, 14,530 (0.7%) were due to mesenteric vascular disease with a median (interquartile range) age of 77 and a 2:1 female to male gender ratio. The mean +/- standard deviation age significantly increased from 72.6 +/- 12.1 in 1979 to 76.8 +/- 11.1 in 2014 (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.772). Males were consistently younger than females at the time of death. The two lowest Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation categories accounted for half of the cohort, throughout the study period (p = 0.068). The adjusted death rate per 100,000 population increased from 7.6 in 1979 to 12.1 in 2014. Conclusions The reported death rates of mesenteric vascular disease in Scotland between 1979 and 2014 have nearly doubled. Mesenteric vascular disease affects twice as many women as men and is associated with social deprivation. The increased reporting of mesenteric vascular disease is likely due to increased recognition and incidence. These implications should be considered when planning healthcare provision in Scotland.

J	Antonello, M; Squizzato, F; Piazza, M				Antonello, Michele; Squizzato, Francesco; Piazza, Michele			The Viabahn balloon expandable stent for endovascular reconstruction of the infrarenal aorta and its bifurcation in cases of severe obstructive disease	VASCULAR			English	Article						Peripheral artery disease; stent; iliac artery; endovascular procedures; aortic bifurcation	CERAB TECHNIQUE; GRAFT	Introduction The covered endovascular reconstruction of the aortic bifurcation (CERAB) represents a promising technique for the treatment obstructive lesions involving the aortic bifurcation. The aim of this report is to describe the use of a new generation balloon-expandable stent-graft (Viabahn VBX, W.L. Gore&Associates, AZ, USA), in the CERAB configuration for the treatment of aorto-iliac obstructive lesions involving the infrarenal aorta and bifurcation. Technical note:This technique was adopted in two patients with severe aorto-iliac obstructive lesions. After bilateral iliac recanalization, an 11 mm diameter VBX stent was deployed in the infrarenal aorta; a post-dilatation up to 16 mm with a non-compliant balloon was performed to adapt the proximal edge of the stent to the aortic diameter. Two 8 mm diameter VBX stents were then deployed at the aortic bifurcation in a kissing conformation, overlapping with the previously positioned aortic stent for 15 mm. A post-ballooning with two kissing 12 x 20 mm compliant balloons (Powerflex Pro PTA, Cordis, CA, USA) was performed to adapt the parallel stents to the aortic cuff. A post-operative angio-CT demonstrated optimal conformability of the aortic cuff to the aortic wall, and apposition of the kissing stents to the aortic cuff. Conclusions This preliminary experience shows that the VBX stent may allow an effective reconstruction of the aortic bifurcation; the conformability and flaring capability may allow to overcome the diameter mismatch between the aorta and the iliac arteries.

Methods This was a retrospective non-randomized study. All patients underwent one-stage hybrid common femoral artery (CFA) endarterectomy combined with an inflow and/or outflow endovascular revascularization procedure. Demographic, clinical, and lesion characteristics for each patient were reported. Primary patency analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier life tables, and univariate and multivariate analysis was used to assess possible predictors of PP loss and clinical improvement. Results Complete data were obtained from 132 patients. Patients were divided into two groups according to their Rutherford's category (RC), group 1 (Rutherford 4) and group 2 (Rutherford 5 and 6). Technical success was 98%. The overall surgical peri-operative complication rate was 8%. At a mean follow-up of 32 +/- 23 months, the rate of major adverse limb events (MALE) was 30%; only the rate of major amputation between two groups was significant statistically different (p = .006). Group 1 had significantly lower amputation rate at 36 months (p = .01). The presence of high iliac peripheral artery calcium scoring system (PACCS) grade (HR 9.43, 95% CI 2.40-36.9, p = .001), the poor run-off of leg vessels (HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.92, p = .04), and undergoing CFA endarterectomy combined with outflow endovascular revascularization procedure (HR 4.25, 95% CI 1.07-16.89, p = .04) were independent predictors of PP loss, while severe iliac artery stenosis (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.32, p = <.001) and the presence of pre-operative patent leg vessels (OR 8.03, 95% CI 2015-29.95, p = .002) were the significant independent predictors of LCI. Conclusion The use of hybrid first line approach in patients with CLTI is a safe and feasible technique. From the analysis of the current study, it is clear that any effort should be made to achieve as many patency leg vessels as possible in order to obtain better and longer lasting clinical outcomes.

Endovascular therapy and hybrid techniques are alternative treatments that are also currently available. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the outcomes of the different treatment approaches in the last 20 years. Methods Studies on acute mesenteric ischemia that were indexed in PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE databases (from January 1, 2000, to April 1, 2021) were reviewed. All related retrospective observational studies and case series were included. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled estimates, and the results were reported as proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results In our study, a total of 2369 patients (in 39 studies) underwent endovascular, open surgery, or retrograde open mesenteric stenting. The pooled mortality estimates for open surgery, endovascular therapy, and retrograde open mesenteric stenting were 40% (95% CI, 0.33-0.47; I-2 = 84%), 26% (95% CI, 0.19-0.33; I-2 = 33%), and 32% (95% CI, 0.21-0.44; I-2 = 26%), respectively. Conclusions The mortality associated with open surgical treatment, endovascular therapy, and retrograde open mesenteric stenting tend to be similar in the last 20 years.

Methods We analysed 102 computed tomography carotid angiograms. The study included the measurement of the neck and sternocleidomastoid length, diameter and volume and the size of the carotid space. Analysis of carotid artery geometry, the length, angle and height of carotid artery bifurcation and the direction of the internal carotid artery origin was also included. Results We found a positive correlation only between the neck and carotid length. There was no correlation between other neck characteristics and a carotid anatomy or internal carotid artery stenosis. Direction of internal carotid artery origin was significantly different (p < 0.01) between the left and right sides. Conclusions We have not found a correlation between the size of sternocleidomastoid and carotid space and carotid stenosis as a hypothetical factor for atherosclerosis. Also, the degree of carotid artery stenosis did not correlate with other neck and carotid measurements. Neck and carotid anatomy correlated only in their lengths. The left internal carotid artery showed mostly posterolateral origin, and right internal carotid artery had no predominate direction.

Methods The records of patients undergoing combined superficial femoral artery endovascular therapy with popliteal-to-distal bypass for chronic limb-threatening ischemia from January 2014 to April 2020 at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. The patients' background, operative details, and long-term outcomes were analyzed. Results Fifty-two popliteal-to-distal bypasses with superficial femoral artery endovascular therapy were performed in 49 patients (33 men; mean age, 76 +/- 9 years; diabetes mellitus, 80%; end-stage renal disease with hemodialysis, 47%). The Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II classification of superficial femoral artery-popliteal lesion was "A" in 8 (15%) patients, "B" in 14 (27%) patients, "C" in 24 (46%) patients, and "D" in 6 (12%) patients. The intervention for superficial femoral artery lesions was plain old balloon angioplasty in 4 patients, self-expandable nitinol stent in 15 patients, drug-coated balloon in 18 patients, drug-eluting stent in 4 patients, stent graft in 10 patients, and interwoven nitinol stent in 1 patient. Distal bypass originated from the above-knee popliteal artery in 9 (17%) limbs and the below-knee popliteal artery in 43 (83%) limbs. The most common outflow artery was the posterior tibial artery (44%). The mean follow-up period was 17 +/- 17 months. The primary and secondary patency of the graft was 44% and 72%, respectively, at 1 year and 39% and 72%, respectively, at 3 years. Primary patency and freedom from clinical-driven target lesion revascularization of superficial femoral artery endovascular therapy lesions were 85% and 90%, respectively, at 1 year and 63% and 75%, respectively, at 3 years. Limb salvage was 97% at 1 year and 92% at 3 years. Wound healing was 67% at 6 months and 83% at 12 months. Conclusions Combined superficial femoral artery endovascular therapy with popliteal-to-distal bypass may be a promising approach for patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia because of durable patency, acceptable wound healing, and good limb salvage.

Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 25 consecutive patients with uretero-arterial fistulas admitted to our hospital from 2011 to 2020. Endpoints were technical success, freedom from open conversion, stent-graft/graft-related complications, and 30-day and one-year mortality. Results The study included 25 patients (68% female, n = 17) with 27 uretero-arterial fistulas by bilateral pathologies in two patients. The mean age was 61 +/- 11 years (range 35-80). The most common predisposing factors for uretero-arterial fistula were history of pelvic operations for malignancy in 21 patients (84%), radiotherapy in 21 patients (84%), previous pelvic vascular bypass in 2 patients (8%), and iliac aneurysms in 2 patients (8%). On average, the period between the primary pelvic surgery and the diagnosis of uretero-arterial fistulas was 46 months (range 7-255). Twenty patients (80%) underwent endovascular treatment of the uretero-arterial fistulas. The primary technical success of the endovascular treatment was 95%, and the freedom from open conversion was 40% at six months and 30% at one year. Thirteen uretero-arterial fistulas (48%) underwent delayed open conversion due to recurrent bleeding in six cases (46%), stent-graft infection in three cases (23%), or pelvic abscess in four cases (31%). Primary open surgery was applied for five (20%) patients. After a mean follow-up of 34 months, early (<30 days) mortality was 8% (2/25), one-year mortality 16% (4/25), and overall mortality was 24% (6/25). Conclusions Uretero-arterial fistula is a late complication of prior pelvic surgery, radiation, and indwelling ureteral stents. Endovascular treatment remains an effective and less invasive modality in controlling the related life-threatening arterial bleeding of the uretero-arterial fistula. Open surgical treatment is still required for patients with local sepsis, previously failed endovascular treatment or infected stent-grafts.

Methods We retrospectively reviewed the diagnosis and treatment of 18 cases of superior mesenteric artery aneurysm admitted to our center from 2003 to 2020, including demographic data, risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment strategies, and follow-up results. Results The average age of the patients was 49.1 years, and males accounted 83.3%. The development of the disease was associated with infection, hypertension, pancreatitis, and trauma, but no significant associations with atherosclerosis were noted by our results. Nine patients were diagnosed with true aneurysm, seven patients with pseudoaneurysm, and two patients with dissecting aneurysm. Rupture of aneurysm occurred in three patients (16.7%), and one of them died before surgery. The surgery success rate was 94.1%, and open surgery was performed on nine patients, endovascular surgery on three patients, and conservative treatment on three patients. The follow-up rate was 77.8% (14/18), and the average follow-up time was 48.2 months. The mortality and reintervention rate during follow-up was 0. The two-year patency rate of artificial vessels and covered stents was 50%. Conclusion The clinical manifestations and features of superior mesenteric artery aneurysms vary between patients. Careful evaluation of vascular anatomy and personalized treatment strategy are critical in the management of superior mesenteric artery aneurysms. Midterm follow-up results of superior mesenteric artery aneurysms are satisfactory.

Methods Relevant publications were found through a precise search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE. Count data were calculated as the odd ratio (OR)and 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Mantel-Haenszel statistical method, quantitative data were calculated as mean difference and 95% CI using Inverse Variance statistical method. When the data heterogeneity was large, with an I-2 > 50%, a random-effects model and sensitivity analysis were performed. The analysis tool we used was the software Revman 5.3 and G*power 3.1. Results There were 7 publications involving 958 patients who were enrolled ultimately. The incidence of unplanned secondary intervention and postoperative adverse events in the TEVAR + BMS were lower than standard TEVAR (OR, 0.42, (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.75); OR, 0.57, (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.90)), and the pooled number needed to treat was 15 for unplanned secondary intervention and 15 for postoperative adverse events. There were no significant difference in the aortic-related or all-cause 30-day mortality (OR, 0.81, (95% CI, 0.25 to 2.61); OR, 0.47, (95% CI, 0.18 to 1.22)), aortic-related, all-cause mortality at least 6 months or incidence of the postoperative endoleak (OR, 0.47, (95% CI, 0.17 to 1.32); OR, 0.42, (95% CI, 0.17 to 1.06); OR, 0.81, (95% CI, 0.32 to 2.05)). Conclusion There is no significant outcome difference except for reduced reintervention but this does not seem to adversely affect survival. It is unclear whether this justifies the additional cost of placing it in every complicated type B aortic dissection regardless of anatomy after standard TEVAR alone. Besides, more data are needed to verify the adjunctive distal bare metal stents' performance at different dissection stages.

Methods In December 2019, a total of 1121 registered nurses from a university-affiliated hospital were selected to answer the self-designed and electronic questionnaire (Wenquanxing:), which was designed to evaluate the nurses' knowledge (21 items), attitudes (6 items), and behaviors (9 items) toward venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Descriptive, correlation, and regression analyses were conducted for data analysis. Results Of the included 1121 nurses, only 55.43% nurses selected 100% correct answer. The influencing factors of knowledge included the department, education, professional ranks, and venous thromboembolism nursing experience. The nurses from ICU department gained the highest score, but the nurses from pediatrics department obtained the lowest score. The nurses with higher education level and professional ranks, and nursing experiences achieved higher scores. The total positive response rate for the attitude-related items was 68.54%. Nurses were primarily concerned about the financial penalty due to the inability to complete the work (49.0%). An increasing workload is the second primary concern of nurses (40.8%). The increasing medical cost, extension of hospital stay, and exacerbation of doctor-patient conflicts were the most serious difficulties involved in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. The total correct score rate for the behaviors was 56.19%. Nearly half of the nurses could not offer advice for venous thromboembolism patients. The nursing experience, department, and years of work were related to the scores of knowledge-related items (allP < 0.05). Conclusions The overall knowledge level of the nurses was not optimistic. Although their general attitude toward venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was positive, their behaviors were influenced by many factors. Administrators should, therefore, make countermeasures to deal with these problems.

A review of through-knee amputation	VASCULAR			English	Review; Early Access						Amputee; Gritti-Stokes; Mazet; knee disarticulation; surgical technique	GRITTI-STOKES AMPUTATION; LOWER-LIMB AMPUTATION; FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES; GAIT ANALYSIS; DISARTICULATION; AMPUTEES; FLAP	Objectives Through-knee amputation is an umbrella term for several different surgical techniques, which may affect clinical and functional outcomes. This makes it hard to evaluate the benefits and need for a through-knee amputation approach. This article seeks to (1) determine the number of through-knee amputation performed compared with other major lower limb amputations in England over the past decade; (2) identify the theoretical concepts behind through-knee amputation surgical approaches and their potential effect on functional and clinical outcomes and (3) provide a platform for discussion and research on through-knee amputation and surgical outcomes. Methods National Health Service Hospital Episodes Statistics were used to obtain recent numbers of major lower limb amputations in England. EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched using a systematic approach with predefined criteria for relevant literature on through-knee amputation surgery. Results In the past decade, 4.6% of major lower limb amputations in England were through-knee amputations. Twenty-six articles presenting through-knee amputation surgical techniques met our criteria. These articles detailed three through-knee amputation surgical techniques: the classical approach, which keeps the femur intact and retains the patella; the Mazet technique, which shaves the femoral condyles into a box shape and the Gritti-Stokes technique, which divides the femur proximal to the level of the condyles and attaches the patella at the distal cut femur. Conclusions Through-knee amputation has persisted as a surgical approach over the past decade, with three core approaches identified. Studies reporting clinical, functional and biomechanical outcomes of through-knee amputation frequently fail to distinguish between the three distinct and differing approaches, making direct comparisons difficult. Future studies that compare through-knee amputation approaches to one another and to other amputation levels are needed.

Thoracic endograft placement using a transfemoral snare in a patient with angled aortic arch	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Snare; aortic aneurysm; endograft	STENT-GRAFT PASSAGE; GUIDEWIRE STABILIZATION; ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR	Objective In complex anatomical challenges, endovascular endograft implantation to the thoracic aorta may not be performed. Various techniques have been put forward for endograft therapy. In this report, we present the effect of femoral snare support for a patient with an aortic arch angle. Method Thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) was used for treating a 60-year-old male patient who suffered from severe angulation in the arcus aorta and aneurysmal enlargement of the left subclavian artery and descending aorta. The endovascular graft could not be advanced into the aortic arch with the guidewire because of the aortic arch angle. Therefore, the TEVAR graft distal end was caught with the snare advanced from the femoral artery, and the TEVAR graft was advanced into the aortic arch. Conclusion and result The femoral snare technique is a simple and successful method for endograft implantation of the aortic arch disease without the risk of heart trauma, especially in cases with aortic arch tortuosity.

In this study, we assessed early and mid-term outcomes of total endovascular arch repair combined with a new method of in situ laser fenestration. Methods Between January 2018 and March 2019, five patients with a history of cardiovascular surgery underwent in situ laser fenestration procedures using the "squid capture technique" for aortic arch pathologies with dissection. All patients were followed up regularly and imaging examinations were performed. The technical success, procedural complications, as well as the early and mid-term mortality and morbidity rates were evaluated. Results All patients survived the operation and fenestration was technically successful in all of the patients. There was no in-hospital mortality. No patients developed major complications, such as peri-operative strokes, transient ischemic attacks, or spinal cord ischemia. The 11-22 months follow-up (mean, 17 months) was completed by all patients. No endoleaks were discovered; false lumen thromboses and subsequent positive remodeling of the aorta were demonstrated and all in situ laser-fenestrated arteries were patent. Conclusions In situ laser fenestration combined with "squid capture technique" was shown to may be an effective and safe option for reconstruction of aortic arch during thoracic endovascular aortic repair. In situ laser fenestration combined with "squid capture technology" was shown to be an effective treatment option for patients with prior history of cardiovascular surgery and who are at high risk for redo open operations.

In peripheral artery disease, the prognostic impact of resting heart rate remains elusive. Methods Consecutive patients undergoing invasive peripheral procedures were included. Data included resting heart rate determination by averaging manual radial pulse palpation measurements taken 24 h before and after an invasive peripheral procedure. Results A total of 1720 patients were included (mean age 70 +/- 11 years, 38% were female, 39% had critical limb ischemia). During a median follow-up of 729 days, 364 (21.2%) patients died. Resting heart rate emerged as an independent predictor of mortality, even after adjusting for clinical characteristics, peripheral artery disease manifestation and anatomic extent, traditional risk factors, co-morbidities, and disease-modifying therapies: hazard ratio for heart rate >75 bpm was 1.010 (95% confidence interval 1.001-1.109), with each bpm increase in resting heart rate conferring a 1.1% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval 0.1-10.9%, adjusted p = 0.030). Conclusions Resting heart rate is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with peripheral artery disease; our findings extend heart rate as a possible marker of prognosis to non-coronary atherosclerotic vascular disease.

Investigation of a method for long-term preservation of the vascular allograft	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Vascular graft preservation; allograft transplantation; ethanol preservation	CRYOPRESERVED ILIAC ARTERY; HEMODIALYSIS ACCESS; LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY; ACCEPTABLE CONDUIT; VENOUS ALLOGRAFT; ROOT REPLACEMENT; AORTIC ROOT; VEIN; GRAFTS; RECONSTRUCTION	Background/objective During multiple organ procurement, blood vessels are routinely retrieved and stored in University of Wisconsin solution and then discarded after two weeks, if not used at organ transplantation owing to lack of a method for long-term preservation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate a method for long-term preservation of vascular allografts in ethanol. Methods Aorta and vena cava allografts were retrieved and stored in 75% ethanol solution for 12 months at 4 degrees C. Four pigs were divided into two groups. A segment of aorta was excised and replaced by insertion of preserved aorta graft (Group A) or vena cava graft (Group V). The pigs were observed for six weeks. A laparotomy was performed and the vascular graft was harvested for histopathology followed by euthanasia at the end of study. Results Three pigs recovered uneventfully, while one pig died from venous graft rupture in the third week after surgery. There was no aneurysmal formation or thrombosis in the grafts. Some calcification was seen over aorta allograft. On histopathology, the elastic pattern was almost normal, although the endothelial cells degenerated after preservation. After implantation, the formation of the endothelium cell-like layer was seen in both aorta and vena cava allografts. Conclusion Vascular allografts were functional after preservation for 12 months. The vena cava grafts had much less wall calcification than the aorta grafts. Further studies are necessary to investigate vascular graft remodelling with a longer observation period after implantation.

Methods From January 2009 to March 2020, patients who underwent endovascular therapy for PAU and IMH were enrolled. Information on patient demographics, presentation, PAU and IMH morphology, laboratory examination, and clinical follow-up information was collected and analyzed. Univariate analysis was performed to identify the differences between IMH and PAU, and Kaplan-Meier was used to calculate the cumulative survival rate and freedom from reintervention. Results A total of 114 patients were enrolled; 80 (70.2%) of them were diagnosed with PAU. Compared with PAU, patients with IMH were younger (p = 0.006), more likely to be admitted emergently (p = 0.001), had longer hospital stay (p = 0.028), and had higher levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.030). Meanwhile, patients with IMH were more likely to be associated with hypertension (p = 0.020) and pleural effusion (p < 0.001) and less likely to have a history of acute coronary syndrome (p = 0.019) and prior cardiovascular intervention (p = 0.017). The five-year freedom from reintervention and cumulative survival rate were 94.2% (95% confidential interval, 88.9%-99.9%) and 87.8% (95% confidential interval, 79.5%-96.9%) in PAU patients and 89.6% (95% confidential interval, 75.8%-99.9%) and 85.1% (95% confidential interval, 68.0%-99.9%) in IMH patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in freedom from reintervention (p = 0.795) or cumulative survival rate (p = 0.817). Conclusions IMH appeared to occur in younger patients with hypertension and usually had an acute onset, while PAU was more likely to be found incidentally in older patients with atherosclerosis. Endovascular therapy was effective in both IMH and PAU patients with encouraging outcomes.

Deep venous reconstructive surgeries are reserved for cases that do not show a good response to conservative therapies. Method We present the case of a 68-year-old man presenting with swelling, pain, and pigmentation in his left lower limb for 14 years and ulcers for 10 years. Descending venography identified a Kistner's grade IV reflux in the deep vein of the left lower limb. Internal valvuloplasty was performed following Kistner's method. Meanwhile, external wrapping with a 1-cm-wide polyester-urethane vascular patch was performed to strengthen the vein wall in the venospasm condition. Results Symptoms were immediately relieved postoperatively. Refractory ulcers healed five months after the procedure. At the six-month follow-up, color duplex ultrasound of the deep vein of the left lower limb showed no reflux in the proximal segment of the femoral vein. Conclusion Internal valvuloplasty combined with sleeve wrapping is feasible in the treatment of severe deep venous incompetence with good short-term results.

Methods A retrospective review of all patients with isolated subclavian artery aneurysms who underwent endovascular treatment between March 2008 and March 2020 was performed. The demographics, aneurysmal characteristics, treatment strategies, and in-hospital and follow-up outcomes were recorded and then analyzed. Results From March 2008 to March 2020, 35 isolated subclavian artery aneurysms were endovascularly treated at our institution. Atherosclerosis was the most common cause of aneurysms in this series. Most aneurysms were intrathoracic (91.4%) and located at the right side (77.1%). There were 26 true aneurysms, seven pseudoaneurysms, and two ruptured isolated subclavian artery aneurysms. Five types of endovascular strategies were performed. Covered stent placement across the aneurysm was the most (54.3%) commonly used method. Technical success was achieved in all patients. The median postoperative in-hospital stay was 4.0 days (range, 1-15 days). One patient died after discharge but within 30 days of surgery due to myocardial infarction. The median follow-up time was 62.0 months (range, 3-132 months). No death, stroke, stent fractures, or severe upper limb ischemia developed during the follow-up period. The cumulative survival rate at five years was 97.1%. The overall complication rate was 25.7% and one-third of complications (8.6%) required reinterventions. Conclusions Endovascular treatment for isolated subclavian artery aneurysms is safe, effective and technically achievable in most patients. Short- and long-term outcomes are promising. Reasonable and flexible use of covered stents can also get satisfactory outcomes in some complicated lesions such as isolated subclavian artery aneurysms located at the origin of the right subclavian artery, avoiding the huge surgical trauma caused by conventional open repair.

Staged angioplasty can prevent cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome. Conventional staged angioplasty consists of small balloon angioplasty in the first stage and carotid artery stenting in the second stage two to four weeks later. Sometimes, antegrade flow during stage 1 could hardly be maintained and stent will be needed. Solitaire stents were used in some patients in our center. This study aimed to examine the safety and effectiveness of Solitaire stents in staged angioplasty. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with severe carotid artery stenosis and preoperative computed tomography perfusion indicating risk of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome from 2011 to 2018. Small balloon angioplasty (<3 mm in diameter) only was performed in stage 1 (group 1). If antegrade flow during stage 1 is compromised, then a solitaire stent is deployed (group 2). After two to four weeks, cerebral angiography was undertaken in both groups to determine whether to perform stage 2. If the residual stenosis was more than 50%, carotid artery stenting was deployed. Angiographic results, clinical results, and follow-up results were collected and analyzed. Results Twenty-five patients were included in the study (group 1, n = 19; group 2, n = 6). After stage 1, no patient in group 2 and two patients in group 1 developed new symptomatic cerebral infarction (0.0% vs. 10.5%, p = 1.000). One patient in group 2 and three patients in group 1 (16.7% vs. 15.8%, p = 1.000) developed symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome. One patient in group 2 (n = 4) and three patients in group 1 (n = 12) (25% vs. 25%, p = 1.000) developed hyperperfusion phenomenon. Two patients in group 2 and five patients in group 1 (33.3% vs. 26.3%, p = 1.000) developed symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome or hyperperfusion phenomenon. One patient in group 1 developed symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome and hyperperfusion phenomenon. After stage 2, no new cerebral infarction occurred in both groups. No patient in group 2 (n = 3) and one patient in group 1 (n = 17) developed symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (0.0% vs. 5.9%, p = 1.000). In the combined analysis of both stages, two patients (10.5%) developed new symptomatic cerebral infarction and four patients (21.1%) developed symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome in group 1, no patient (0.0%) developed symptomatic cerebral infarction and one patient (16.7%) developed symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome in group 2. There was no significant difference in symptomatic cerebral infarction and symptomatic cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome between the two groups (p = 1.000; p = 1.000). Three patients in group 2 and 17 patients in group 1 (50% vs. 89.5%, p = 0.070) underwent stage 2 angioplasty. No cerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarction occurred in the Solitaire group during the one-year follow-up period. Conclusions Solitaire stents deployment may reduce ischemic events in staged angioplasty for severe carotid stenosis.

This study aimed to analyze the long-term outcomes of unsupervised exercise therapy for patients after above-knee femoropopliteal bypass. Material and methods We retrospectively analyzed 69 patients (69 limbs, 69 grafts) who underwent above-knee femoropopliteal bypass from April 2009 to March 2018 in our hospital. At six months after above-knee femoropopliteal bypass, we evaluated the maintenance of unsupervised exercise therapy. Patients who continued unsupervised exercise therapy or discontinued unsupervised exercise therapy were assessed via 1:1 propensity matching. Long-term outcomes such as patency, survival, and major adverse cardiovascular events were compared between the groups after matching. We also analyzed the maintaining rate of unsupervised exercise therapy in a study cohort. Results Twenty-nine (42%) patients continued unsupervised exercise therapy until six months after above-knee femoropopliteal bypass. The discontinued unsupervised exercise therapy had higher proportions of female sex (p = 0.015) and cerebrovascular disease (p = 0.025) than did the continued unsupervised exercise therapy. The mean follow-up period was 65 +/- 36 months. After propensity matching, the rates of the following factors were significantly higher in the continued unsupervised exercise therapy than in the discontinued unsupervised exercise therapy: primary patency (97% vs. 61%,p = 0.0041), secondary patency (100% vs. 69%,p = 0.0021), and freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events (61% vs. 24%,p = 0.0071) at five years. Both groups had a similar survival rate. The maintaining rate of unsupervised exercise therapy in the study cohort was 44% at six months, 41% at one year, 36% at three years, 25% at five years, and 25% at seven years. Conclusion The findings of this study suggested superior long-term outcomes, including graft patency and freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events, with unsupervised exercise therapy after open bypass than with the usual therapy. Unsupervised exercise therapy may be recommended for the patients after open bypass.

Two-year follow-up of bioresorbable vascular scaffolds in severe infra-popliteal arterial disease	VASCULAR			English	Article						Angiography; bioresorbable; intervention; PAD; peripheral	CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA; BARE-METAL STENTS; ELUTING STENTS; BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY; IMPLANTATION; METAANALYSIS; MULTICENTER; PATHOLOGY	Objectives To assess the safety, efficacy, and durability of the Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold in predominantly complex, infra-popliteal lesions for the management of chronic limb ischemia at two-year clinical follow-up. Bioresorbable vascular scaffold are biodegradable scaffolds that provide short-term vascular support before undergoing intravascular degradation. A recent trial reported excellent 36-month vessel patency rates in simple infrapopliteal arterial lesions treated with Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold. Methods This single-center, retrospective study evaluated the use of the Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold (everolimus impregnated poly-L-lactic scaffold) in patients with infra-popliteal peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with respect to safety (thrombosis and TIMI bleeding), technical success, and freedom from clinically driven target vessel failure at 24 months. Results 31 patients (51.6% male) with a median age of 67 years with predominantly advanced infra-popliteal disease were treated with 49 bioresorbable vascular scaffold in 41 vessels. The mean stenosis was 94% (80-100), with 49% of lesions being chronic thrombotic occlusions. No scaffold thrombosis or peri-procedural bleeding was observed. Procedural success was achieved in all patients; 93.5% of patients experienced freedom from clinically driven target vessel failure at 24 months, driven by one revascularization and one amputation. Primary patency was 96.7% at 12 months and 87.1% at 24 months. All patients were alive at 12 and 24 months. Conclusions At 24 months, our study found that patients with predominantly advanced infra-popliteal PAD who were treated with Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold reported improved clinical status and a low and durable rate of clinically driven target vessel failure extending out to 24 months.

Thromboembolic complications are rare with superficial venous aneurysms. The data regarding optimal therapy and pathogenesis of superficial venous aneurysm is sparse and is limited to isolated case reports. Methods:Here, we present an unusual case of thrombosed large great saphenous vein aneurysm which was managed with Doppler, preoperative anticoagulation and surgical excision. Results and conclusion:This paper is intended to review the current knowledge about the pathogenesis of superficial venous aneurysm of lower extremities, their optimal management and to guide future research in this area.

Risk factors associated with 30-day hospital readmission after carotid endarterectomy	VASCULAR			English	Article						Carotid endarterectomy; 30-day readmission; complications	NATIONWIDE INPATIENT SAMPLE; RATES; PROTAMINE; QUALITY; CARE	Objective The current study evaluated all-cause 30-day readmissions after carotid endarterectomy. Methods Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were selected from the Cerner Health Facts (R) database using ICD-9-CM procedure codes from their index admission. Readmission within 30 days of discharge was determined. Chi-square analysis determined characteristics of the index admission (demographics, diagnoses, postoperative medications, and laboratory results) associated with readmission. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify characteristics independently associated with readmission. Results In total, 5257 patients undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy were identified. Readmission within 30 days was 3.1%. After multivariable adjustment, readmission was associated with end-stage renal disease (OR: 3.21, 95% CI: 1.01-10.2), hemorrhage or hematoma (OR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.15-4.77), procedural complications (OR: 3.07, 95% CI: 1.24-7.57), use of bronchodilators (OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.03-2.11), increased Charlson index scores (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.08-1.38), and electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia < 135 mEq/L (OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.07-2.67) and hypokalemia less than 3.7 mEq/L (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.03-4.98)). Conclusions Factors associated with readmission following carotid endarterectomy included younger age, increased comorbidity burden, end-stage renal disease, electrolyte disorders, the use of bronchodilators, and complications including bleeding (hemorrhage or hematoma). Of note, in this real-world study, only 40% of the patients received protamine, despite evidence-based literature demonstrating the reduced risk of bleeding complications. As healthcare moves towards quality of care-driven reimbursement, physician modifiable targets such as protamine utilization to reduce bleeding are greatly needed to reduce readmission, and failure to reduce preventable physician-driven complications after carotid interventions may be associated with decreased reimbursement.

J	Beasley, M; Broce, M; Mousa, A				Beasley, Matthew; Broce, Mike; Mousa, Albeir			The acute impact of baseline renal function and contrast medium volume/estimated glomerular filtration rate ratio on reduced renal function following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Reduced renal function; endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair; contrast volume; estimated glomerular filtration rate; ratio; renal; failure	ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY; CROSS BLUE-SHIELD; INDUCED NEPHROPATHY; STATIN THERAPY; OUTCOMES; DEFINITION; PREDICTORS; ARTERY; INTERVENTION; MORTALITY	Objective The aim of this study was to determine the acute impact of baseline serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and contrast medium volume (CMV) on the incidence of reduced renal function (RRF) after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). We aimed to determine if the CMV/eGFR ratio was a predictor of RRF. Methods This study is a retrospective review of EVAR patients in the Society for Vascular Surgery/Vascular Quality Initiative (SVS/VQI) from January 2015 to August 2020. Reduced renal function was defined as > 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 mu mol/L), 50% increase from baseline, and temporary or permanent dialysis. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were conducted for serum creatinine, eGFR, contrast volume, fluid volume, and CMV/eGFR ratio. Two data sets (training and test) were developed followed by multivariate analyses. Results SVS/VQI data for EVAR contained 38,701 records, of which 30,539 were divided into training (n = 18,283; 60%) and test (n = 12,256; 40%) data sets. RRF rate for the training set was 3.6% (n = 667) and 3.4% (n = 420) for the test data. RRF patients included more females (29.4 vs 19.0%, p < 0.001), were older in age (75.6 + 8.4 vs 73.3 + 8.7 years), had more congestive heart failure (22.3 vs 12.2%, p < 0.001), and more COPD (42.0 vs 34.2%, p < 0.001). An ROC analysis revealed that eGRF, creatinine, contrast, intravenous fluid, and contrast medium volume (CMV)/eGFR ratio were all significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with RRF. The eGFR and CMV/eGFR ratio had the largest area under the curve, (0.26) and (0.65), respectively, while fluid had the lowest (0.54). Negative predictive values were 93.7 (CMV/eGFR), 93.9 (creatinine), 94.2 (eGFR), 92.8 (contrast), and 92.6 (intravenous fluid). Multivariate analysis of the training data set resulted in the CMV/eGFR ratio as an independent predictor of RRF (odds ratio, OR: 1.9 with 95% CI: 1.6, 2.2, p < 0.015). For the test data, the CMV/eGFR ratio was an independent predictor of RRF (OR: 1.8, CI: 1.4 to 2.2, p < 0.001) as well as several other variables. Conclusion RRF after EVAR is a dreaded and potentially devastating complication. Baseline serum creatinine, eGFR, contrast medium volume, and the ratio (CMV/eGFR) were all significantly associated with RRF. The optimal cut-off value for the CMV/eGFR ratio, <= 2, provides an easy-to-use equation to provide a suggested contrast target based on initial renal function with caution applied for high-risk patients.

First report of intravascular ultrasound-guided intravascular lithotripsy to treat an underexpanded stent in the superficial femoral artery	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Intravascular lithotripsy; peripheral arterial disease; intravascular ultrasound	ATHERECTOMY; IMPACT	Background/Objective To evaluate the safety and utility of a new in Europe intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) catheter in a case of peripheral arterial disease caused by in-stent restenosis of the superficial femoral artery. Method Pre-therapeutic computed tomographic angiography identified severe stent restenosis related to device underexpansion, which was caused by an underlying eccentric severely calcified stenosis leading to suboptimal device deployment. The OptiCross 18 (30 MHz Peripheral Imaging Catheter, Boston Scientific, USA) is a short rail imaging catheter. It consists of two main assemblies: The imaging core is composed of a hi-torque, flexible, rotating drive cable with a radial looking 30 MHz ultrasonic transducer at the distal tip. An electro-mechanical connector interface at the proximal end of the catheter makes the connection to the Motordrive Unit (MDU5 PLUSTM) Instrument. The MDU5 PLUS-catheter interface consists of an integrated mechanical drive socket and electrical connection. Results The use of the IVUS-guided imaging revealed in-stent restenosis, fracture, and protrusion of the calcified plaque in the stent and confirmed the preoperative computed tomography angiography which showed stent compression. Use of intravascular litotripsy catheter (intravascular lithotripsy Shockwave Medical, Santa Clara, California) and drug coated balloon led to improvement in stent expansion, having minimal patent diameter of 5.77 mm. The patient's subsequent clinical course was uneventful, and clinically had palpable pulses in the foot and ankle-brachial index of 1. Conclusions Whether acoustic pulse application might affect device structure in the long term remains to be determined, use of the novel IVUS system demonstrated excellent visibility of the etiology of the in-stent restenosis improving the perioperative diagnostic modalities of suboptimal endovascular outcome.

This retrospective study was undertaken to study the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous dialysis access interventions in arm fistulas and bridge grafts in an office-based endovascular center. Methods Patients who had a percutaneous dialysis access intervention in their upper extremity access site, performed at a single office-based endovascular center over a nine-year period (2007-2016) were included in this study. The patients' demographic factors, patency, and complications were analyzed. Patients were entered in the study after first percutaneous dialysis access intervention. Results A total of 298 limbs in 259 patients had 913 procedures carried out over a nine-year period. There were 190 access arteriovenous fistulas and 108 arteriovenous grafts. The two most common arteriovenous fistulas were the brachiocephalic fistula (n = 74, 39%) and radio cephalic fistula (n = 69, 36%). Arteriovenous grafts were most commonly placed in the upper arm (n = 66, 61%) followed by the forearm (n = 42, 39%). The mean overall patency for all limbs was 50.86 months. Arteriovenous fistulas had a significantly longer patency than arteriovenous grafts (51.65 vs. 42.09 months; P = 0.01). In addition, patients with two or more percutaneous dialysis access intervention in their arteriovenous fistula had significantly greater patency than those with only one percutaneous dialysis access intervention (58.5 vs. 7.6 months; hazard ratio 0.41; P = 0.0008). This was not true for the arteriovenous graft group. Women represented 49% of the patient group. Their accesses had shorter patency than men (39.8 vs. 60 months; P = 0.0007). Conclusions This data support the use of repeated percutaneous dialysis access intervention to maintain long-term patency of dialysis access sites in an office-based endovascular center. Overall, fistulas have longer patency than grafts and women have poorer outcomes as compared to men	[Patel, Jay; Chang, Stephanie; Manawar, Shaan; Munn, John; Rummel, Mark C.; Jain, Krishna] Michigan Univ, Homer Stryker MD Sch Med, Kalamazoo, MI USA; [Munn, John; Rummel, Mark C.; Johnston, Dan; Jain, Krishna] Adv Vasc Surg, Kalamazoo, MI USA		Jain, K (通讯作者)，550 North St Clair,Suite 1906, Chicago, IL 60661 USA.	dockrishna1@gmail.com		, Jay/0000-0003-4737-8740			Al-Jaishi AA, 2014, AM J KIDNEY DIS, V63, P464, DOI 10.1053/j.ajkd.2013.08.023; Allon M, 2001, KIDNEY INT, V60, P2013, DOI 10.1046/j.1523-1755.2001.00031.x; Arhuidese IJ, 2018, J VASC SURG, V68, P1166, DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2018.01.049; BEATHARD GA, 1992, KIDNEY INT, V42, P1390, DOI 10.1038/ki.1992.431; Brooke BS, 2019, J VASC SURG, V70, P1620, DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2019.01.085; Dobson A, 2013, SEMIN DIALYSIS, V26, P624, DOI 10.1111/sdi.12120; Feldman HI, 2003, AM J KIDNEY DIS, V42, P1000, DOI 10.1016/j.ajkd.2003.07.003; GLANZ S, 1984, RADIOLOGY, V152, P637, DOI 10.1148/radiology.152.3.6235537; Heye S, 2012, EUR J RADIOL, V81, P2298, DOI 10.1016/j.ejrad.2011.09.004; Huijbregts HJT, 2008, CLIN J AM SOC NEPHRO, V3, P714, DOI 10.2215/CJN.02950707; Jain K, 2014, J VASC SURG, V59, P186, DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2013.07.008; Jain KM, 2010, J VASC SURG, V51, P509, DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2009.09.056; Kian K, 2007, SEMIN DIALYSIS, V20, P346, DOI 10.1111/j.1525-139X.2007.00293.x; Lok CE, 2006, J AM SOC NEPHROL, V17, P3204, DOI 10.1681/ASN.2006030190; Lumsden AB, 1997, J VASC SURG, V26, P382, DOI 10.1016/S0741-5214(97)70031-4; MacRae Jennifer M, 2016, Can J Kidney Health Dis, V3, p2054358116669127, DOI [10.1177/2054358116669126, 10.1177/2054358116669127]; Malka KT, 2016, J VASC SURG, V63, P772, DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2015.09.031; Manou-Stathopoulou S, 2019, J VASC ACCESS, V20, P716, DOI 10.1177/1129729819845991; Marcus RJ, 2007, GENDER MED, V4, P193, DOI 10.1016/S1550-8579(07)80040-4; McCullough KP, 2019, J AM SOC NEPHROL, V30, P127, DOI 10.1681/ASN.2018050531; Minar E., 2009, Z GEFASSMEDIZIN, V6, P48; Neuen BL, 2014, J VASC INTERV RADIOL, V25, P1419, DOI 10.1016/j.jvir.2014.05.020; Oliver MJ, 2001, KIDNEY INT, V60, P1532, DOI 10.1046/j.1523-1755.2001.00956.x; Ravani P, 2016, AM J KIDNEY DIS, V67, P446, DOI 10.1053/j.ajkd.2015.11.013; Schwab SJ, 1999, KIDNEY INT, V55, P2078, DOI 10.1046/j.1523-1755.1999.00409.x; System USRD., 2019, AM J KIDNEY DIS, V73, pS45; Yan Y, 2013, J VASC INTERV RADIOL, V24, P1765, DOI 10.1016/j.jvir.2013.08.025	27	0	0	0	0	SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD	LONDON	1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND	1708-5381	1708-539X		VASCULAR	Vascular	APR	2022	30	2					229	237	17085381211004306	10.1177/17085381211004306		APR 2021	9	Peripheral Vascular Disease	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Cardiovascular System & Cardiology	0H2LT	33813972				2022-04-29	WOS:000637115400001

Methods All patients with ECAA at a single institution were reviewed from February 2014 to February 2020. Eight consecutive patients (three men, mean age 64.5 years) treated with endovascular repair with self-expandable covered stent graft were retrospectively reviewed. Patient characteristics, angiographic results, and follow-up outcomes were retrospectively recorded. Access to ECAA was gained via a femoral approach or a direct puncture of common carotid artery after surgical exposure because of kinking of the aortic arch and common carotid artery. A self-expandable covered stent graft (Viabahn; W. L. Gore, Flagstaff, AZ) was deployed to exclude the aneurysm. Results Based on imaging features, there were five peudoaneurysms and three true aneurysms. The technical success rate was 100%. Cerebral protection devices were not used in all the patients during the procedures. Immediate absolute obliteration of the ECAA with no endoleak was documented in all the patients. Perioperative complications included one internal carotid-cavernous sinus fistula, one bleeding at the puncture site, and one stroke. The mean follow-up period was 35.5 months (range, 9-72 months). All the patients were alive, with an obligation rate of 100%. No transient ischemia attack, stroke, or reoccurrence of symptoms was identified during the follow-up period. Radiological examinations identified patency of the stent grafts and revealed no endoleaks, stent fracture, stent migration, or aneurysm rupture. Conclusions Endovascular treatment of ECAAs with self-expandable covered stent grafts appears to be a safe and feasible alternative for traditional open surgery, especially in the challenging anatomy and instable physical conditions. Although cerebrovascular accidents can occur as the result of hemodynamic changes during the perioperative period, the minimal alternative can yield satisfactory midterm follow-up clinical outcomes.

Treatment using traditional surgical methods has certain disadvantages. This study investigated the effectiveness of thoracic endovascular repair of aortic dissection using an external prefenestrated stent. Methods We present a series of aortic dissection cases involving the ascending aorta and aortic arch treated with an external prefenestrated stent. Results Postoperative follow-up of the patients showed that all stents were released at the proper position and that branch vessels were not occluded, and there were no instances of type I endoleak. One patient died suddenly one week after surgery; another experienced retrograde type A aortic dissection in the second week; and type I endoleak occurred in one patient in the first week, although this resolved within six months. No serious complications such as cerebrovascular events, acute spinal cord ischemia, and paraplegia occurred during the perioperative period. All patients had false lumen thrombosis in the ascending aorta and aortic arch. Conclusion Prefenestrated stent grafting is a feasible treatment option for repairing an entry tear in the ascending aorta.

MethodsMODIFIER LETTER TRIANGULAR COLONRetrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted. During an eight-year period, 1095 ligations of all saphenofemoral junction inferior tributaries and great saphenous vein stripping were performed in 814 Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, Pathophysiology C2-C6 patients. Duplex ultrasound follow-up examinations were performed after 30 days, 6 months, and 2 years, and saphenofemoral junction hemodynamic patterns and varicose veins recurrence rates were evaluated. Results Two hundred and twenty patients completed the two-year follow-up period. At the 30-day Duplex ultrasound evaluations, two different hemodynamic patterns were described. Type 1, with physiological drainage of saphenofemoral junction superior tributaries, was observed in 214 patients. Type 2, without flow in saphenofemoral junction superior tributaries, was observed in six patients. Overall varicose vein recurrence rates were 0, 2.3, and 2.7% at the 30-day, 6-month, and 2-year follow-up examinations, respectively. At the two-year follow-up, Type 1 patients showed 0% varicose vein recurrence, while Type 2 patients showed 100%. ConclusionsMODIFIER LETTER TRIANGULAR COLONInferior selective crossectomy seems to be a valid and safe option in case of both suprasaphenic valve and great saphenous vein incompetence. Duplex ultrasound evaluation, according to our protocol, allows us to identify two different saphenofemoral junction hemodynamic patterns that could predict varicose vein recurrence at mid-term. An optimal stump washing after inferior selective crossectomy, warranted by patency and large caliber saphenofemoral junction superior tributaries, seems to be the key point in preventing varicose vein recurrence in this context. However, large prospective studies regarding saphenofemoral junction modifications and varicose vein recurrence are needed to confirm these preliminary observations.

We normally focus on symptomatic patients, and symptoms can range from the respiratory to the gastrointestinal system. In addition, we consider patients without fever and respiratory symptoms, with both a negative RT nasopharyngeal swab and lung CT, as a "Covid-19 negative patient." In this article, we present a so called Covid-19 "negative" patient, with an unsuspected vascular clinical onset of the viral infection. Methods An 80 y.o. man, who previously underwent endovascular aortic repair for an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, presented to our department with an atypical presentation of an aorto-enteric fistula during the pandemic. While in hospital, weekly nasopharyngeal swab tests were always negative for SARS-CoV-2. However, the absence of aortic endograft complications, the gross anatomy of duodenal ischemic injury, and the recent history of the patient who lived the last months in Bergamo, the Italian city with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths, lead the senior Author to suspect an occult SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient underwent to resection of the fourth portion of the duodenum and the first jejunal loop, with subsequent duodenum-jejunal latero-lateral anastomosis and the direct suture of the aortic wall. The intestinal specimen was investigated as suspected SARS-CoV-2 bowel infection by the means of immune-histochemistry (IHC). An ileum sample obtained in the pre-COVID-19 era was used as a control tissue. Results The histological analysis of the bowel revealed sustained wall ischemia and liponecrosis of the duodenal wall, with intramural blood vessels thrombosis. Blood vessel endotheliitis and neo-angiogenesis were also observed. Finally, the IHC was strongly positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and for HLA-G presence, with a particular concentration both in blood vessels and in the intestinal villi. The control tissue sample was not positive for both SARS-CoV-2 and HLA-G. Conclusions Coronavirus pandemic continues to be an international challenge and more studies and trials must be done to learn its pathogenesis and its complications. As for thromboembolic events caused by SARS-COV-2, vascular surgeons are involved in treatment and prevention of the complications of this syndrome and must be ready with general surgeons to investigate atypical and particular cases such as the one discussed in this article.

Methods In this retrospective analysis, all patients with juxtarenal AIOD at a single institution were reviewed from June 2015 to January 2020. Patient characteristics, angiographic results, and follow-up outcomes were retrospectively recorded. The indications for treatment were critical limb threatening ischemia in 12 patients and bilateral claudication in five patients. Percutaneous access via the left brachial artery was first obtained to recanalize the infrarenal occluded lesions. After that, femoral accesses were achieved. A 4-Fr catheter, a 4 mm balloon, or a 6-Fr 90-cm-long sheath was used to complete visceral artery protection. Results A total of 17 juxtarenal AIOD patients (14 males; mean age, 63.4 +/- 8.1 years) underwent endovascular treatment. The technical success rate was 100%. Complete reconstruction was achieved in 15 (88.2%) patients. The infrarenal aorta was reconstructed with kissing covered stent grafts (n = 7), kissing bare-metal stents (n = 2), covered stent grafts (n = 2), bare-metal stents (n = 1), or the off-label use of iliac limb stent grafts (n = 5). Renal embolization was found in 3 (17.6%) patients during intraoperative angiography. There was 1 (5.9%) case of distal runoff embolization after CDT and 1 (5.9%) case of left iliac artery rupture. One (5.9%) death occurred due to acute myocardial infarction 20 days after the operation. The average follow-up period was 19.3 +/- 16.7 months (range, 1-54 months) in the remaining 16 cases. The renal artery patency rate was 100%. The estimated cumulative primary patency rates were 92.3% at 12 months and 59.3% at 36 months according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Conclusions Transbrachial and transfemoral approaches combined with visceral protection offer a safe and effective alternative to open revascularization for the endovascular treatment of juxtarenal AIOD.

Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted of 51 consecutive patients (mean age 57.6 +/- 12.5 years, 39 males) treated with thoracic endovascular aortic repair using physician-modified endovascular grafts for reconstructing the left subclavian artery from November 2015 to December 2019. The primary endpoints during follow-up were the overall mortality, aorta-related mortality, and major complications. The secondary endpoints were reintervention and the patency of the target branches, the demographics and technical details were also described and analyzed. Results Sixty-three thoracic stent-grafts were deployed in 51 patients and emergency surgery was performed in 10 patients (19.6%). Technical success was 94.1% (48/51). The incidence of perioperative complications was 15.7%, and the 30-day mortality was 0%. At a mean follow-up of 42.0 +/- 14.4 months (range, 14-63 months), all the left subclavian arteries remained patent. All-cause mortality was 3.9% (2/51) and not aorta-related deaths. Estimated survival at one and three years was 98.0 +/- 1.9% and 96.0 +/- 2.8%, respectively. Conclusions The physician-modified endovascular grafts is feasible and effective to preserve left subclavian artery in thoracic endovascular aortic repair for aortic arch pathologies with unhealthy proximal landing zone.

Previous studies have documented a high rate of occlusion and minimal postoperative complications. The aim of this study was to compare occlusion rates and clinical outcomes of endovenous laser treatment with the VariClose (R) vein sealing system in the treatment of truncal vein insufficiency. Patients and methods: Retrospective non-randomized single center study with prospectively collected data comparing endovenous laser treatment and VariClose (R) procedures between April 2018 and November 2019. Results: VariClose (R) was used in 27 patients (30 veins) and endovenous laser treatment in 42 patients (51 veins). The occlusion rate at one, three, and six months were 96%, 85%, and 65% for VariClose (R) procedures and 100%, 100%, and 97% for endovenous laser treatment procedures (p = 0.01), respectively. Reduction of VCSS scores before treatment and at the last postoperative follow-up visit in the VariClose (R) group dropped by an average of 1.8 +/- 1.6 and in the endovenous laser treatment by an average of 3.3 +/- 2.9 (p = 0.01). Conclusion: VariClose (R) vein sealing system is inferior to endovenous laser treatment as a treatment option for varicose veins as it has a higher recanalization rate.

In this modern era, we aimed to define where open surgical interventions are of greatest benefit for limb salvage. Methods Patients who underwent interventions for chronic limb-threatening ischemia were identified in the vascular-targeted lower extremity National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database for open surgical interventions (OPEN) and endovascular surgical interventions (ENDO) from 2011 to 2017. Patients were further stratified based on the criteria of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (rest pain or tissue loss), and the location of the diseased arteries (femoropopliteal or tibioperoneal). The main outcomes measured included 30-day mortality, amputation, and major adverse cardiovascular events. Results A total of 17,193 patients were revascularized for chronic limb-threatening ischemia: 10,532 were OPEN and 6661 were ENDO. OPEN had higher 30-day mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, pulmonary, renal dysfunction, and wound complications. However, OPEN resulted in significantly lower 30-day major amputation (3.8% vs. 5.0%, odds ratio (OR): 0.83 [0.72-0.97], P = .018). Subgroup analysis revealed a higher mortality rate in OPEN was observed only in tibioperoneal intervention for tissue loss. Major adverse cardiovascular event was higher in OPEN for most subgroups. OPEN for patients with tissue loss had significantly lower amputation rate than ENDO in both femoropopliteal and tibioperoneal subgroups (3.7% vs. 5.1%, OR: 0.76 [0.59-0.98], P = .036, and 4.7% vs. 6.6%, OR: 0.74 [0.57-0.96], P = .024, respectively). The benefit of open surgery in reducing the amputation rate was not seen in patients with rest pain. Conclusions Open surgical intervention is associated with significantly better limb salvage than endovascular intervention in patients with tissue loss. Surgical options should be given more emphasis as the first-line option in this cohort of patients unless the cardiopulmonary risk is prohibitive.	[Lee, K.

Management might be either with medical or interventional approach. Recently, thoracic endovascular intervention (TEVAR) becomes the first treatment of choice because of its better results and lower rates of complications in patients with type III aortic dissections. The intervention might be performed via femoral artery either with percutaneous or with surgical approach. Because of large sheath insertion to femoral artery, Pre-close technique is described in literature. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the outcomes and safety of 'Pre-close technique' to surgical approach in patients with type III aortic dissections who underwent TEVAR with femoral access >= 22 F. Methods A total of 96 patients whom had type III aortic dissection and was performed TEVAR were retrospectively included in the study. Fifty-six patients had TEVAR with percutaneous approach and these patients are named as P-TEVAR group, and 40 patients had TEVAR with surgical approach and these patients are named as S-TEVAR group. Pre- and post-procedural data with complications and procedural data during TEVAR were evaluated for both groups and compared in between. Results The main finding was that there was no significant difference between S-TEVAR and P-TEVAR groups in terms of complications and technical success. Operating room time was significantly decreased in P-TEVAR group (P < 0.001). Overall success rate for femoral approach in patients with Pre-close technique was 94.6% and was 100% for surgical approach. P-TEVAR group had post-operative complications in three patients and S-TEVAR group had in four patients. Conclusions Total percutaneous approach with Pre-close technique using Pro-Glide device is a safe and feasible method of femoral access in patients with type III aortic dissections.

Methods In this retrospective study, 130 consecutive patients with symptomatic IMAD from three institutions were enrolled from January 2011 to December 2019. The general epidemiological data, clinical manifestations, first-episode symptoms, imaging findings, and treatment strategy selection were analyzed from the medical records. Results Among 130 patients diagnosed with symptomatic IMAD, positive remodeling of the SMA was achieved in 75.38% (98/130), and negative remodeling of the SMA was achieved in 24.62% (32/130). In the positive remodeling group, complete remodeling was achieved 39.23% (51/130) (type I 6 patients, type IIa 10 patients, type IIb 35 patients), in which type IIb was the most (p = 0.004). Moreover, of the 32 patients in whom negative remodeling of the SMA was achieved, significant differences were observed between the type IIa with respect to dissecting aneurysm formation (p = 0.04).Of the seven factors analyzed with a logistic regression model identified three factors significantly associated with negative remodeling: length of dissection (Wald chi(2)13.331; OR 6.945; 95% CI 2.762-10.498;p = 0.014), true lumen residual diameter (TLRD) (Wald chi(2)9.626; OR 7.85; 95% CI 1.892-19.063;p = 0.022), and branch involvement (Wald chi 2 11.812; OR 7.247; 95% CI 1.245-14.830;p = 0.011). Conclusion The prognosis of most symptomatic IMAD has a tendency to positive remodeling after conservative management, in which the initial type IIb classification is common.

We aimed to compare outcomes of starting dialysis on arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) versus arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) in haemodialysis patients. Methods We conducted a systematic search of multiple electronic information sources and bibliographic reference lists. The following outcome parameters were evaluated at 1, 2 and 5 years: primary failure, defined as access never used for dialysis; primary patency, defined as intervention-free access survival; primary-assisted patency, defined as uninterrupted access survival with interventions; and secondary patency, defined as cumulative access survival. Results We identified 15 comparative studies reporting a total of 118,434 patients who initiated haemodialysis with AVF (n = 95,143) or AVG (n = 23,291). Our analysis demonstrated that AVF was associated with significantly higher primary failure rate (OR: 2.05, p = .0005) but significantly higher rate of primary patency at 1 year (OR: 1.91, p < .00001), at 2 years (OR: 2.52, p < .00001) and at 5 years (OR: 2.59, p < .00001); and primary-assisted patency at 1 year (OR: 1.71, p < .00001), at 2 years (OR: 2.13, p < .00001) and 5 years (OR: 2.79, p < .00001). There was no significant difference in secondary patency at 1 year (OR: 1.08, p < .00001) but AVF had better secondary patency at 2 years (OR: 1.26, p < .00001) and 5 years (OR: 1.60, p < .00001) than AVG. Conclusions The meta-analysis of best available comparative evidence (Level 2) demonstrated that AVFs may be associated with significantly higher primary failure rate but higher primary patency, primary-assisted patency and secondary patency at 1, 2 and 5 years compared to AVGs. However, the available evidence is subject to significant selection bias and confounding by indication.

Can we replace computed tomography angiography by contrast-enhanced ultrasound in the surveillance of patients submitted to aortoiliac aneurysm repair?	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair; surveillance; endoleak; contrast-enhanced ultrasound; computed tomography angiography	ABDOMINAL AORTIC-ANEURYSM; COLOR DUPLEX ULTRASOUND; FOLLOW-UP; II ENDOLEAK; SCAN; ULTRASONOGRAPHY; US	Objectives This study was designed for evaluation of CEUS (contrast-enhanced ultrasound) for the detection of endoleaks after EVAR (endovascular aortic aneurysms repair) as an alternative to CTA (computed tomography angiography), the gold standard in post-EVAR surveillance. Methods Post-EVAR surveillance of patients who underwent CEUS and CTA was retrospectively analyzed to compare the accuracy of CEUS compared to CTA. For that, the following parameters were analyzed: the largest aneurysm diameter, type of endoleaks, and the time elapsed after EVAR using both surveillance tests. Results The study involved 110 pairs of exams in patients with infrarenal aortoiliac or isolated iliac artery aneurysm, covering predominantly a male population (89%). The time elapsed after EVAR using CEUS or CTA exams were statistically similar, ranging from one to 58 months (mean 12.2) and one to 65 months (mean 9.7), respectively (p = 0.124). CEUS sensitivity was 75.5%, specificity 96.7%, false positives were 24.5%, and false negatives were 3.3%. The accuracy between the two exams was 87.3%. A secondary analysis, comparing CTA with CEUS as a reference standard, revealed CEUS sensitivity of 24.5%, higher than CTA for detecting endoleaks, with a concordance rate of true positive results of 75.5%. Among the endoleaks detected solely by CEUS (12 cases), one case was type Ia and eleven were type II, while those detected only by CTA (2 cases), one was type Ia and one type II. Additionally, a type II endoleak associated with type Ib, identified by CEUS, was seen as type II for CTA only. There was no difference between the pre-EVAR and the post-EVAR diameters of aortoiliac aneurysm (p = 0.058), both for CEUS and CTA. Computed tomography angiography, on the other hand, showed significant aneurysm diameter reduction compared to CEUS for isolated iliac artery aneurysms (p < 0.001). Conclusion Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was more effective than CTA in identifying and characterizing endoleaks in patients undergoing EVAR, especially type II endoleaks. The advantages include efficacy and, particularly, safety, and must be considered in EVAR surveillance protocols so that its use becomes widespread. We understand that CEUS, as a surveillance exam, considerably reduces risks to patients compared to CTA.

J	Kaygin, MA; Halici, U				Kaygin, Mehmet Ali; Halici, Umit			Our clinical experiences of vascular injuries due to lumbar disc surgeries	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Vascular complications; vascular surgery; vascular trauma	COMPLICATIONS	Objectives We aimed to evaluate emergency vascular complications of the lumbar disc reconstructive surgery in this study. Method Between March 2006 and February 2020, nine patients (six males and three females; mean age: 53.4 +/- 9.6 years; range: 38-64 years) who underwent emergent vascular intervention during lumbar spinal disc reconstructive surgery in our clinic were included in this retrospective study. Result The left common iliac artery injury, the left common iliac artery and left common iliac vein injuries, bilateral common iliac artery and abdominal aortic injuries, and vena cava inferior injury with left common iliac vein and right common iliac vein injuries were detected in two, three, two, and two patients, respectively. In addition, 16 mm Dacron tube graft interposition and graft patch plasty were performed in one and two patients who had an abdominal aortic injury, respectively. Also, 8 mm polytetrafluoroethylene straight graft interposition was performed in two patients with left common iliac artery injury, and lateral wall repair was performed in other patients. Graft patch plasty and 8 mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft interposition were performed in one patient with vena cava inferior injury and left common iliac vein injury, respectively. Also, lateral wall repair was performed in other patients with venous injuries. Deep venous thrombosis had developed in three patients, and one patient of these had a pulmonary embolism. Conclusion The incidence of vascular injury after the lumbar disc surgery is relatively low; however, the emergency vascular operation should be performed as soon as possible.

Safety and outcomes of combined carbon dioxide angiography and OCT-guided femoro-popliteal chronic total occlusion crossing and directional atherectomy in patients with chronic kidney disease	VASCULAR			English	Article						Peripheral intervention; directional atherectomy; optical coherence tomography; chronic kidney disease; CO2 angiography		Background Carbon dioxide angiography with addition of optical coherence tomography imaging may improve procedural success and clinical outcomes in patients with peripheral artery disease and chronic kidney disease. Methods Single-center, retrospective analysis of patients with chronic kidney disease who underwent carbon dioxide angiography and optical coherence tomography-guided chronic total occlusion crossing and/or optical coherence tomography-guided directional atherectomy was performed. Patient and procedure-related characteristics, along with peri- and one-year post-procedural major adverse events, were analyzed. Results A total of 18 vessels in 11 patients, with mean age 70 years were treated. All had co-morbidities such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, had history or were current smokers with baseline peripheral artery disease. Majority were diabetic with coronary disease (82%); 55% baseline chronic kidney disease IV, 55% Rutherford class III and 45% class IV. Contrast was used in only two patients. Mean total fluoroscopy time and radiation dose was 24.1 min and 249.2 mGY, respectively. Half of the lesions were femoro-popliteal chronic total occlusions, and Ocelot catheter was used to cross seven of nine chronic total occlusions and was successful in six. Adjunctive optical coherence tomography-guided directional atherectomy was performed in 8 of 11 patients. Only two adverse events occurred: one clinically significant event of slow-flow intra-procedurally and one target limb revascularization within one year of index procedure in a vessel different than prior treated. Optical coherence tomography imaging in both chronic total occlusion-crossing and atherectomy resulted in 10-min mean fluoroscopy reduction time and 32 mGY reduction in radiation dose. Conclusion Carbon dioxide angiography with the addition of optical coherence tomography imaging for chronic total occlusion crossing and/or optical coherence tomography-guided directional atherectomy reduced the need for contrast agents, total fluoroscopy time, and radiation exposure in patients with peripheral artery disease and baseline chronic kidney disease.

Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-100 might alleviate the inflammatory damage and apoptosis of H2O2-induced ECV304 cells and aimed to investigate the relationship between miR-100 and thromboangiitis obliterans and the related molecular mechanism. Methods Cell counting kit-8 was used to detect cell viability, and the expression of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress was measured by ELISA. TUNEL assay was used to detect the apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells after induction by H2O2. Furthermore, the interaction between miR-100 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 was verified by dual-luciferase assay. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot were used to detect the expression of the adhesion factors, apoptosis-related proteins and Notch pathway-related protein. Results The results revealed that miR-100 was decreased in H2O2-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Overexpression of miR-100 attenuated inflammatory response and cell apoptosis in H2O2-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The overexpression of miR-100 inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in H2O2-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells. miR-100 inhibited H2O2-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis via inactivation of Notch signaling by targeting matrix metalloproteinase. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that miR-100 reduced the inflammatory damage and apoptosis of H2O2-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells via inactivation of Notch signaling by targeting matrix metalloproteinase. These findings suggested that miR-100 might be a novel therapeutic target for the prevention of thromboangiitis obliterans.

J	Elkassaby, M; Elsaadany, N; Mowaphy, K; Soliman, M				Elkassaby, Mohammed; Elsaadany, Nashaat; Mowaphy, Khaled; Soliman, Mosaad			Balloon-assisted maturation of autogenous arteriovenous fistulae: A randomized controlled prospective study	VASCULAR			English	Article						Arteriovenous fistulae; functional maturation; balloon-assisted maturation		Background Current guidelines recommend referral of patient with renal failure for access creation 6 months before planned dialysis. There is a growing cohort of patients that require long-term hemodialysis without adequate preparation. Temporary dialysis catheters and rapid access arteriovenous grafts (AVG) are far from being an ideal solution in this scenario. In an effort to expedite maturation of autogenous arteriovenous fistulae (AVF), balloon-assisted maturation (BAM) was advised by some authors. This technique still lacks the support of high-level evidence studies. We investigated the ability of intra-operative BAM to induce early functional maturation of AVFs. Methods This is a prospective randomized controlled study conducted in a tertiary referral center, with a catchment area of more than 15 million population. Cases were divided into two groups; Group (A), where BAM technique was performed, while in the control group (B), the standard technique was used (NO BAM) for creation of AVFs. Results Between June 2017 and May 2019, 300 cases were recruited from a total of 648 primary AVF creation instances. Patients' age ranged from 19 to 89 (mean 51.17 +/- SD 15.5) years. Group A (BAM) included 52.3% (n = 157) AVFs, while Group B included 47.7% (n = 143) AVFs. The average maturation time was 3.7 weeks (SD +/- 1.3, 95% CI 3.55-3.95) and 5.91 weeks (SD +/- 2.2, 95% CI 5.55-6.26) for both groups, respectively (p = 0.0001). 78.3% of the AVFs that underwent BAM showed early maturation within 2-4 weeks vs 32.2% only in the NO BAM group (p = 0.002). Successful functional maturation was higher among cases of the BAM group (93%), compared to the NO BAM group (77%) (p = 0.001). Complication rates were 9.6% and 4.9% in the two groups, respectively (p = 0.042). Conclusion BAM can play a pivotal role in helping the dialysis society meet the goals of the Fistula First Initiative, keeping in mind that this comes with an increased risk of complications.

The challenge of maintaining necessary vascular and endovascular services at a referral center in Northern Italy during the COVID-19 outbreak	VASCULAR			English	Article						COVID-19; vascular surgery; coronavirus		Objectives The Padova Hospital Vascular Surgery Division is located in Veneto, one of the area of the Northern Italy most hit by the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The aim of this paper is to describe the protocols adopted and to evaluate their impact during the acute phase of Coronavirus spread, focusing on the management of elective and urgent/emergent surgery, outpatients activity, and also health staff preservation from intra-hospital Coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Methods Several measures were progressively adopted in the Padova University Hospital to front the Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, with a clear strong asset established by 9 March 2020, after the Northern Italy lockdown. Since this date, the Vascular Surgery Unit started a "scaled-down" activity, both for elective surgical procedures and for the outpatient Clinical activities; different protocols were developed for health preservation of staff and patients. We compared a two months period, 30 days before and 30 days after this time point. In particular, emergent vascular surgery was regularly guaranteed as well as urgent surgery (to be performed within 24 h). Elective cases were scheduled for "non-deferrable" pathology. A swab test protocol for COVID-19 was applied to health-care professionals and hospitalized patients. Results The number of urgent or emergent aortic cases remained stable during the two months period, while the number of Hospital admissions via Emergency Room related to critical limb ischemia decreased after national lockdown by about 20%. Elective vascular surgery was scaled down by 50% starting from 9 March; 35% of scheduled elective cases refused hospitalization during the lockdown period and 20% of those contacted for hospitalization where postponed due to fever, respiratory symptoms, or close contacts with Coronavirus disease 2019 suspected cases. Elective surgery reduction did not negatively influence overall carotid or aortic outcomes, while we reported a higher major limb amputation rate for critical limb ischemia (about 10%, compared to 4% for the standard practice period). We found that 4 out of 98 (4%) health-care providers on the floor had an asymptomatic positive swab test. Among 22 vascular doctors, 3 had a confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 infection (asymptomatic); a total of 72 swab were performed (mean = 3.4 swab/person/month) during this period; no cases of severe Coronavirus disease 2019 (deaths or requiring intensive care treatment) infection were reported within this period for the staff or hospitalized patients. Conclusions Elective vascular surgery needs to be guaranteed as possible during Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The number of truly emergent cases did not reduce, on the other side, Emergency Room accesses for non-emergent cases decreased. Our preliminary results seem to describe a scenario where, if the curve of the outbreak in the regional population is flattened, in association with appropriate hospitals containment rules, it may be possible to continue the activity of the Vascular Surgery Units and guarantee the minimal standard of care.

Methods We conducted a prospective, non-randomized, pilot study to assess the feasibility, safety, and benefit of CR in PAD patients after revascularization compared to standard of care (controls). CR feasibility was assessed by the ability to complete 36 sessions. Safety was defined as the absence of adverse cardiovascular events during CR. Quality of life (QoL) assessment was performed using SF-36 form (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) and PAD-specific quality of life questionnaire (VascuQOL6). Other endpoints included incidence of claudication during 6-minute walk test (6MWT), mean distance, and number of laps walked. All outcome data were collected before and after CR completion. Standard statistical tests were used for comparisons. Results This study enrolled 20 subjects (CR group = 10). Mean age was 60.70 (+/- 7.13) and 63.1 (+/- 9.17) years in CR and controls, respectively (p-value > 0.05). Fifty percent and 60% were female in CR and control group, respectively. All subjects completed 36 CR sessions without adverse events. The increase in mean distance walked during 6MWT was higher in the CR group compared to control group (63.7 m vs. 10.5 m,p = 0.043). Change in mean number of laps walked was higher in the CR group (3.5 vs. -1.1;p < 0.01). Scores on 6 of 8 scales of SF-36 and VascuQOL6 were higher in the CR group, though not statistically significant. Conclusion CR is safe, feasible, and improves walking ability in ambulatory patients with PAD after arterial revascularization.

Impact of renal chimney intra-aortic stent length on branch and end-stent angle in chimney endovascular aneurysm repair and endovascular aneurysm sealing configurations	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Abdominal aortic aneurysm; chimney evar; endovascular aneurysm sealing	GEOMETRIC ANALYSIS; ARTERIES; DEFORMATIONS; EXPERIENCE	Objective Practice patterns and durability of parallel stent graft techniques in complex endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) remain poorly defined. We aimed to quantify and compare the impact of renal chimney intra-aortic stent length (IASL) on geometric deformations of renal arteries in complex EVAR. Methods Thirty-eight nonconsecutive patients underwent EVAR utilizing parallel stent graft techniques (chimney EVAR [chEVAR], n = 28; chimney endovascular aneurysm sealing [chEVAS], n = 10) between 2010 and 2016. A total of 59 renal chimney stent grafts were used. Geometric quantification was derived from three-dimensional model-based centerline extraction. Renal chimney intra-aortic stent length (IASL) was defined as the length of chimney stent that extended from the proximal edge of the chimney stent to the ostium of the corresponding renal artery. Results Mean IASL for both left and right renal arteries in the cohort was 35.7 mm. Renal arteries containing chimney IASL <30 mm trended toward a greater branch angle (135.4 vs. 127.8 degrees, p = .06). Left renal arteries showed significantly greater branch angle among those with IASL <40 mm (135.5 vs. 121.7 degrees, p = .045). Mean IASL for renal arteries in chEVAR was significantly longer compared to chEVAS (39.2 vs. 26.3 mm, p = .003). No difference was noted in overall branch angle or end-stent angle based on procedure type. ChEVAR with IASL <30 mm had significantly greater end-stent angle (48.2 vs. 33.5 degrees, p = .03). In contrast, chEVAS patients showed no difference in end-stent angle based on IASL thresholds, but did have significantly greater branch angle among those with IASL <30 mm when grouped by both all renal arteries (133.5 vs. 113.5 degrees, p = .004) and right renal arteries (134.3 vs. 111.6 degrees, p = .02). Conclusions Renal chimney stents with longer IASL appear to exhibit less renal artery deformation, suggesting a more gradual and perpendicular transition of the chimney stent across the renal ostium.

J	Yigit, G				Yigit, Gorkem			How effective is cyanoacrylate closure in small saphenous vein insufficiency? A single center experience	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Cyanoacrylate; varicose veins; chronic venous insufficiency; endovenous ablation	MECHANOCHEMICAL ENDOVENOUS ABLATION; CLINICAL SEVERITY SCORE; RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION; VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY; INCOMPETENT GREAT; VARICOSE-VEINS; LASER-ABLATION; COMPLICATIONS; CLARIVEIN(R); EMBOLIZATION	Objectives The present study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy and early outcomes of n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) ablation in small saphenous vein (SSV) insufficiency. Methods In this single-center, retrospective, single-arm study, NBCA ablation was performed in 80 patients with SSV insufficiency between September 2018 and May 2020. Primary outcomes (anatomic success rate and occlusion rate) and secondary outcomes (VCSS and AVVQ scores) of the patients were analyzed. Results No technical failure and device-related complications were encountered. Anatomic success rate was 100% after procedures. Each treated SSV was occluded on colored Doppler ultrasonography immediately after the procedure, and all veins remained occluded at 2 weeks after the procedure. Partial recanalization was observed in five patients at 12-month follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed an occlusion rates at 6 months and 12 months follow-up were 97.5% and 93.75%, respectively. The mean pretreatment VCSS (4.72 +/- 2.04) decreased to 1.61 +/- 0.93, 0.87 +/- 0.58, and 0.73 +/- 0.52 at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after treatment, respectively (p < .001). The mean pretreatment AVVQ score (11.92 +/- 2.23) decreased to 8.2 +/- 1.89, 4.2 +/- 1.16, and 3.32 +/- 1.19 at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after treatment, respectively (p < .001). The Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, and Pathophysiology clinical classification at 12 months demonstrated a significant reduction in disease severity compared with preoperative values (p < .001). There was no mortality and major adverse events including anaphylaxis and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) related to procedure after follow-ups. Moreover, there were no symptoms or signs of any sural nerve injury and no cases of skin necrosis, infection, or hyperpigmentation. In addition, no hematoma, deep venous thrombosis, and hypersensitivity reactions were observed. Phlebitis-like abnormal reaction was observed in three patients (3.8%). Conclusions In conclusion, in patients with SSV insufficiency, NBCA ablation with VenaBlock (R) system appears to be an effective and reliable treatment method. At the 12-month follow-up, the NBCA of SSVs showed a low recanalization rate and had a satisfactory improvement on the VCSS and AVVQ scores.

A health cluster observational study	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Peripheral artery disease; family medicine; vascular care	THERAPY; PREVENTION; PREVALENCE; GUIDELINE; KNOWLEDGE; MORTALITY; TRIALS; ARABIA	Introduction Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are often underdiagnosed and undertreated. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of the recommended target levels of blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin A1C, and knowledge and attitude about PAD risk reduction therapies among physicians working in primary care settings in Saudi Arabia. Methods This observational cross-sectional study included family medicine consultants, residents, and general practitioners working in a health cluster in the capital city of Saudi Arabia using a self-administered questionnaire. Results Of the 129 physicians who completed the survey, 55% had completed PAD-related continuing medical education hours within the past 2 years. Despite this, the knowledge score of the recommended target levels was high in only 13.2% of the participants. Antiplatelet therapy was prescribed by 68.2% of the participants. Conclusion Here we identified the knowledge and action gaps among primary care providers in Saudi Arabia. Physicians had an excellent attitude about screening for and counseling about risk factors. However, they showed less interference in reducing these risk factors. We recommend addressing these knowledge gaps early in medical school and residency programs.

This study intended to investigate the strategies of endovascular management of CAAs according to a single-center experience. Methods Anatomically, CAAs were classified into two types: Type I CAAs located in the main trunk of celiac artery. Type II CAAs located on the branches of the celiac artery. Type I and Type II CAAs can be further divided into two different subtypes according to fusiform (a) or saccular or (b) morphology: type Ia, type Ib, type IIa, and type IIb. Patient demographics, clinical manifestations, aneurysm characteristics, endovascular intervention procedures, and perioperative and follow-up outcomes were reviewed and analyzed. Results Between August 2012 and August 2020, 18 consecutive patients (12 men; mean age, 56.8 +/- 14.5 years) with CAAs were identified and treated with endovascular procedures. There were seven patients with type Ia, three patients with type Ib, four patients with type IIa, and four patients with type IIb CAAs. One patient died of hemorrhagic shock due to a ruptured aneurysm. Technical success was achieved in 16 patients (88.9%). The mean follow-up period was 51.7 +/- 19.4 months. No hepatic or intestinal ischemia or death developed perioperatively or during the follow-up period. No aneurysmal expansion was detected on CTA surveillance, except for one patient who was diagnosed with an endoleak during the follow-up and received reintervention. Conclusions The endovascular strategy based on the novel classification of CAAs was safe and effective, with a favorable mid-term clinical outcome.

Methods From November 2015 to August 2020, 36 patients underwent extended TEVAR for residual intimal tear after TAAD repair. We specifically investigated the methods and outcomes of this procedure. Results TEVAR consisted of isolated TEVARs (n = 29), single-vessel debranching TEVAR (6), and two-vessel debranching TEVAR (1). The mean time from TAAD repair to TEVAR was 27 +/- 33 months (2-86 months). The TEVAR devices used were Valiant (28 cases), GORETAG (4), Relay plus (2), and TX2 (2). Technical success of TEVAR was 100%. The distal ends of the stent grafts were T 8 (1 case), T 9 (5), T 10 (6), T 11 (9), and T 12 (15), with an average of T 11 +/- 1. The average length of hospital stay after TEVAR was 9 +/- 3 days (5-17 days). There were no surgical/hospital deaths or complications. The average postoperative follow-up period was 21 +/- 15 months without death or reintervention. Conclusions The short-term outcomes of extended TEVAR for residual chronic type B aortic dissection after TAAD repair were acceptable without perioperative SCI. Aggressive descending thoracic aorta coverage may prevent aortic events, and extended TEVAR may be a preemptive treatment for the downstream aorta. Mid- to long-term results should be clarified.

Methods A retrospective analysis of all patients treated in our institution for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms and TAAAs with custom-made stent grafts consisting of one or more inner branches. Data collected included patients demographics, aortic aneurysm morphology, stent grafts features, perioperative morbidity and mortality and short-term reintervention and mortality rates. Results Twenty-seven patients (18 males, mean age 70 +/- 7.1) were included. Indications for surgery included TAAAs (12, 41%) juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (10, 37%), type 1A endoleaks (4, 15%) and paraanastamotic aneurysms (1, 4%). A total of 90 inner branches were used. Twenty-one (78%) of the stent grafts consisted only of inner branches and six (22%) had a combination of inner branches with either fenestrations or outer branches. Technical success was achieved in 26/27 (96%) of the patients. There was one perioperative mortality. Six patients suffered from major perioperative adverse events. Mean follow-up was seven months (range 1-23). During the follow-up period, four patients (15%) required reinterventions. Branch-related reinterventions were performed in two (7%) patients. No occlusions of inner branches occurred during the follow-up. Conclusions Inner branches in branched endovascular aneurysm repairs offer a feasible option for the treatment of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms and TAAAs. The procedures can be completed with high technical success and with acceptable short-term branch-related reintervention rates. Further follow-up is required to determine the long-term durability of this technology.

J	Xu, YJ; Wang, XM; Shang, D; Liu, JY; Chen, W; Han, XQ				Xu, Yingjiang; Wang, Xuemin; Shang, Dan; Liu, Jianyong; Chen, Wei; Han, Xinqiang			Outcome of AngioJet mechanical thrombus aspiration in the treatment of acute lower extremities deep venous thrombosis	VASCULAR			English	Article						Deep venous thrombosis; AngioJet mechanical thrombus aspiration catheter-directed thrombolysis; treatment	CATHETER-DIRECTED THROMBOLYSIS; VEIN COMPRESSION SYNDROME; POSTTHROMBOTIC SYNDROME; RHEOLYTIC THROMBECTOMY; STATEMENT	Objectives The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety in patients with acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis who underwent pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT, AngioJet mechanical thrombus aspiration). Methods In this retrospective, 424 consecutive patients with acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis from three institutions were enrolled in the study from January 2015 to December 2018. Of these, patients were divided into two groups, AngioJet group (n = 186) and catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) group (n = 238). Evaluation indexes including limb circumference difference, length of stay (LOS), urokinase dosage, periprocedural complications, follow-up imaging findings and villalta scores were analyzed from the medical records. Results A total of 424 patients diagnosed with acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis were collected in this study. These patients were categorized into AngioJet group and CDT group. Significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to the thigh circumference difference (5.32 +/- 1.85 cm vs. 4.69 +/- 2.15 cm;p = 0.04), calf circumference difference (2.79 +/- 1.54 cm vs. 2.35 +/- 1.25 cm;p = 0.01), thigh detumescence rate (72.19 +/- 19.55% vs. 65.35 +/- 17.26%;p = 0.00) and calf detumescence rate (62.79 +/- 18.56% vs. 55.75 +/- 17.27%;p = 0.00). The mean dose of urokinase in AngioJet group was 95.16 +/- 45.89 million IU significantly less than that in the CDT group 293.76 +/- 42.71 million IU (p = 0.00). The overall bleeding complication rate was 9.91% (19 patients in AngioJet group and 23 patients in CDT group), which included three major (0.71%, 3/424) and 39 minor (9.2%,39/424) events. In the AngioJet group, serum creatinine (sCr) concentration and urine erythrocyte from the hemolysis caused by the mechanical process were higher than baseline data at admission (p = 0.00,p = 0.00). The postoperative red blood cell and hemoglobin in two groups were lower than baseline data (p = 0.00,p = 0.00). Compared with CDT, AngioJet thrombectomy has significantly lower estimated incidence of PTS in the follow-up. Conclusion AngioJet thrombectomy has stronger clearance ability for acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis leading to significant reduction in the consumption of hospital resources, total dose of thrombolytic agents, and infusion time, thereby preventing adverse bleeding events, but patients with renal insufficiency should be careful. Ideal short-term and medium-term efficacy and safety are certain.

Periprosthetic seroma occurrence after femoropopliteal bypass grafting: Surgical management after failure of non-surgical measures in relieving symptoms	VASCULAR			English	Article						Periprosthetic seroma; Propaten graft; femoropopliteal bypass; vascular surgery; peripheral arterial disease	PERIGRAFT SEROMA; INFECTIONS; SALVAGE	Objective Periprosthetic seroma is a rare complication of femoropopliteal bypass grafting. Periprosthetic seroma can be defined as the collection of non-infected serous fluid around a prosthetic arterial graft. There is a dearth of literature on how to manage periprosthetic seroma occurrence after femoropopliteal bypass especially in patients whose symptoms do not improve with typical conservative measures. Method/Results:This report highlights the case of a 70-year-old patient who had a femoropopliteal bypass using a 6 mm Propaten graft for peripheral arterial disease. The patient subsequently presented with leg edema. Leg ultrasound and computed tomography arteriogram showed a periprosthetic seroma with a patent graft. Patient was initially managed conservatively and semi-conservatively and ultimately with aggressive therapy utilizing exploration and surgical resection of the seroma capsule. Conclusion Only surgical resection of the seroma capsule produced definitive resolution of the seroma and symptoms. Thigh exploration and surgical resection can be considered as part of the management modalities of periprosthetic seroma occurring after femoropopliteal bypass especially in patients who do not respond to typical conservative measures such as elevation, compression stockings, and diuretics.

Design retrospective, observational, and single-center cohort study. Methods TEVAR procedures performed between November 1995 and December 2020 were analyzed. The primary endpoint of this study was the freedom from endoleak (type I/III) in four stent-graft generations during the follow-up period. The first generation (GEN1) included: Vanguard; AneuRx and Talent; Stentor; Excluder; Endologix; EndoFit. The second generation (GEN2) included: TAG and TX. The third (GEN3) included: Relay Plus; Valiant Captivia; Zenith Alpha and custom-made. The fourth (GEN4) included: Relay Pro; Conformable C-TAG; Navion; E-Vita; Najuta; Nexus; standard and custom-made thoraco-abdominal devices. Nonaortic and aorta-related survival was considered as secondary outcome. Results A total of 509 TEVAR were included with a 44.3 +/- 42.5 months mean follow-up. Freedom from endoleak at 5 years was 65.6%, 61.4%, 76.2%, and 69.1% for GEN1, GEN2, GEN3, and GEN4, respectively (p = 0.368). The first two generations demonstrated a higher endoleak rate when compared with the two most recent ones (27.2 vs 18.2%, respectively; p = 0.043). GEN1 was an independent risk factor (p = 0.014) and GEN4 was an independent protective factor (p = 0.001) for endoleak. GEN1 was found to be a risk factor for type-Ia endoleak (p = 0.059). GEN4 demonstrated a protective association regarding type-Ib endoleak (p = 0.012). Overall survival was 75.3%, 44.4%, 27.2%, and 17.6% at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Survival distinguished as non-related versus aortic-related was 86.7% vs 23.5%, 52.7% vs 9.8%, 32.9% vs 2.0%, 21.2% vs 0% at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively (p< 0.000). Conclusion Endoleak occurred in a non-negligible percentage of TEVAR patients. A significant reduction of endoleak incidence over evolving stent-grafts generations was registered. Newer stent-graft generations demonstrated better long-term endoleak. Data about long-term outcomes require ongoing updates to prove both the reliability and the durability of newer stent-graft generations.	[Gennai, Stefano; Leone, Nicola; Bartolotti, Luigi A.

Patients and methods Data for patients with the diagnosis of VMs coupled with severe LIC who underwent color Doppler-guided microwave dynamic ablation between January 2017 and June 2019 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. All patients had previously received sclerotherapy or other treatments with poor outcomes and gradual aggravation of coagulation abnormalities. Microwave treatment with "dynamic ablation" was performed with real-time color Doppler monitoring and was repeated if necessary after 3 months. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was used to control consumptive coagulopathy. The therapeutic efficacy including coagulation function and lesion size was evaluated using the four-level scale developed by Achauer. Results Among 15 patients with extensive diffuse or multiple VMs, 10 patients presented with lesions in a single lower extremity, one in both lower extremities and the perineum, one in both upper extremities and the trunk, and three with multiple lesions. The patients underwent a total of 74 microwave ablation sessions, with an average of 4.9 sessions per person. Coagulation abnormalities were temporarily aggravated in 59 sessions within the first seven days post-ablation but improved to grade II (fair) a week later. From six months to three years after the ablation, the lesions improved to grade IV (excellent) in one patient, grade III (good) in six patients, and grade II (fair) in eight patients. Moreover, the coagulation function improved to grade IV in four patients, grade III in eight patients, and grade II in three patients, resulting in an efficiency rate of 80% (12/15). Post-ablation complications included fever, hemoglobinuria, and elevations in aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and alanine aminotransferase. The patients with fever and hemoglobinuria recovered after specific therapeutic measures, but elevations in aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and alanine aminotransferase recovered spontaneously without further interventions. Conclusions Ablation coupled with anticoagulation can effectively treat VMs in patients with severe LIC and improve the long-term coagulation function.

A full literature review was conducted to analyze AVPs in comparison with coils for the prevention of endoleaks during endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Methods A systematic review was designed under PRISMA statement guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The results were updated with a subsequent electronic search using Medline and Scopus databases up to December 2019. Results Eighteen articles making this comparison were found. In 79.7% of the cases, the target vessel was the internal iliac artery; in 1.6%, the common iliac artery; and in 16.7%, the inferior mesenteric artery. Risk of complications (buttock claudication, groin hematoma, endoleaks, and erectile dysfunction) after AVP was low. A cost comparison revealed that the mean cost for coils was around US$2262, while the average cost for the AVP was US$310. Conclusions The AVP is an effective and safe device for occluding peripheral vessels, proved to have lower complications rates. Compared with coil embolization, the AVP technique is potentially associated with lower procedural costs.

J	Singh, N; Patel, R; Hingorani, A; Ascher, E				Singh, Nikita; Patel, Ronak; Hingorani, Anil; Ascher, Enrico			Case report of superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery aneurysm repair using brachial vein	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Brachial vein; bypass graft; limb salvage; venous conduit; arm vein; lower extremity	LOWER-EXTREMITY REVASCULARIZATION; ARM VEIN; INFRAINGUINAL BYPASS; CONDUIT	Background Several veins have been well-recognized as acceptable conduits for infrainguinal bypass surgery when the ipsilateral greater saphenous vein is unavailable. However, there is a paucity of literature describing the brachial vein as an adequate alternative. In the absence of other viable autogenous conduits, we describe the use of a brachial vein as a successful alternative for lower extremity revascularization. Methods A 70-year-old man presented with a chief complaint of right calf pain. Duplex ultrasound imaging of his right lower extremity revealed right-sided 2.5 cm acutely thrombosed superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery aneurysms. The patient underwent a suction thrombectomy with tissue plasminogen activator using the Power Pulse feature and Solent catheter from the AngioJet (R) (Boston-Scientific, Marlborough, MA) system. To repair the thrombosed aneurysms, an open bypass was planned. Due to lack of viable alternative traditionally used venous conduits, a bypass was created using the patient's brachial vein. Results A bypass was created from the superficial femoral artery to the P2 segment of the popliteal artery using a non-reversed brachial vein with ligation of the side branches of the superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery aneurysm from within the sac lumen. Completion angiogram revealed runoff through the anterior tibial artery only. Follow-up imaging at three months demonstrated a patent brachial bypass. Conclusion Brachial veins can be safely used as viable venous conduits for lower extremity bypass surgery and should therefore be considered as an alternative when more commonly used veins are unsuitable or unavailable. However, more research is needed to determine the potential opportunities and challenges this alternative may present.

Methods A retrospective review of patients who underwent non-emergency endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) was completed. Patients were excluded if they had a complex repair, including fenestrated, branched, or parallel endografting. Demographics, operative data, 30-day mortality/morbidity and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Results A total of 159 patients were identified with a median age of 69. 115 patients had PEVAR, 45 (39.1%) PEVAR MAC and 70 (60.9%) PEVAR GA. PEVAR MAC compared to PEVAR GA had decreased operative time (106 vs. 134 min, P < 0.001), time in the operating room (163 vs. 245 min, P = 0.016), and estimated blood loss (EBL) (115 vs. 176 mL P = 0.012). There was no statistically significant difference in the hospital length of stay (LOS) (1.9 vs. 2.7 days, P = 0.133), and post-operative complications including pulmonary (2.2 vs. 2.9%, P = 0.835). Forty-four patients had EVAR with a femoral cutdown (FC), including 14 PEVAR conversions. PEVAR conversion was associated with higher EBL (543 vs. 323 mL, P = 0.03), operative time (230 vs. 178 min, P = 0.01), and operating room time (307 vs. 275 min, P = 0.01) compared to planned EVAR with FC. Conclusions PEVAR under MAC is associated with shorter time in the operating room compared to PEVAR under GA. PEVAR under MAC does however not decrease overall morbidities, including postoperative pulmonary complications.

High inter- and intra-observer agreement for measuring tissue oxygenation of the plantar surface of the foot in healthy participants with the Hyperview (R): A pilot study	VASCULAR			English	Article						Hyperview; hyperspectral imaging; inter; and intra-observer agreement; peripheral arterial occlusive disease; chronic wounds	HYPERSPECTRAL TECHNOLOGY	Objectives The Hyperview (R) is a novel camera that applies hyperspectral imaging to project local concentrations of oxyhaemoglobin (OXY), deoxyhaemoglobin (DEOXY) and O-2-saturation (O2-SAT) in a map. In this pilot validation study, we assessed inter - and intra-observer agreement for measuring OXY, DEOXY and O2-SAT in healthy participants. Methods The plantar region of the right foot was assessed with the Hyperview (R) in 50 healthy participants. Two consecutive pictures were taken by the same observer, followed by two images by a second observer. Measurements were performed without and with standardization (a static device for both the foot and the Hyperview camera). Inter- and intra-observer agreements were expressed as Intraclass Correlation coefficients (ICC) with their 95% confidence interval (CI). A score <0.40 indicates poor agreement, 0.40-0.59 fair, 0.60-0.74 good and 0.75-1.00 excellent agreement. Bland and Altman plots were also generated. Results Without standardization, the ICC values between the observers for OXY, DEOXY and O2-SAT ranged from 0.70 to 0.83. The intra-observer agreement of both observers ranged from 0.36 to 0.83. With standardization, the ICC values between the observers ranged from 0.80 to 0.82 and intra-observer agreement varied from 0.75 to 0.92. Four Bland and Altman plots were generated of the measurements of OXY by observers 1 and 2. Conclusions When standardization is used, the Hyperview (R) camera is a reliable device with excellent intra- and inter-observer agreements for the assessment of OXY, DEOXY and O-2-SAT. In future research, the inter- and intra-observer agreements of the camera should be investigated in patients with diabetes and/or peripheral arterial disease.	[van Schilt, Kaz L.

As with stroke and coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease is one clinical type of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with many unmeasured environmental and genetic components. MTHFR C677T polymorphism is associated with the increased risk of ischemic stroke and coronary heart disease. MTHFR C677T polymorphism is associated with decreasing enzyme activity and increasing homocysteine levels. Meta-analysis of studies had demonstrated an association between elevated plasma homocysteine levels and peripheral arterial disease. Elevated plasma homocysteine level is closely related to MTHFR C677T polymorphism. Recent studies had clarified the relationship of MTHFR C677T polymorphism and peripheral arterial disease. So we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between MTHFR C677T polymorphism and peripheral arterial disease. Materials and methods We searched the database PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for all English-language articles related to peripheral arterial disease and MTHFR C677T through 30 June 2020. Analysis results were shown by forest plot. Publication bias was estimated using funnel plot. Results A total of 15 studies comprising 1929 patients with peripheral arterial disease and 2952 healthy controls were included in the meta-analysis. Significant associations between MTHFR C677T genetic polymorphism and peripheral arterial disease were found (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.09-1.58, P <0.01). But there was no significant association (poor OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.98-1.26, P =0.11) between the T allele carrier and peripheral arterial disease. Conclusion Our meta-analysis suggested that MTHFR C677T genetic polymorphism TT genotype may be associated with increased peripheral arterial disease risk. But further studies with large sample sizes are needed to confirm our findings.

J	De Santis, F; Notari, MP; Chiappa, R				De Santis, Francesco; Notari, Maria Paola; Chiappa, Roberto			Early periaortic hematoma development after EVAR in the presence of severely calcified and modestly conical-shaped aortic neck: A potential trigger for sudden aneurysm progression toward rupture	VASCULAR			English	Article						Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair; severely calcified aortic neck; conical-shaped aortic-neck; abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture periaortic hematoma; aortic neck lesions		Objective The aim of this report is to present a singular case of early post-endovascular aneurysm repair abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture and discuss the possible etiopathogenic mechanism promoting the sudden aneurysm progression toward rupture. Methods/Results: An 84-year-old man was submitted to endovascular aneurysm repair via second-generation endograft (Cordis-Incraft Stent-graft) during which, the left occluded common iliac artery was recanalized via balloon-expandable covered-stent-graft (Atrium-Advanta-V12). The aneurysm presented a severely calcified and modestly conical-shaped aortic-neck. The post-operative course was complicated by a broncho pneumonic infiltrate and a CT scan performed two weeks postoperatively accidentally revealed a relatively small hematoma surrounding the aortic wall. No active bleeding, endoleak, or aneurysm increase in diameter was documented. Nevertheless, the patient remained closely monitored. Three days later, he suffered from abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture. A CT scan revealed an arterial wall tear at the neck level. Intra-operatively the reanalyzed common iliac artery was intact and a good endograft-sealing was confirmed. Following this event, small lumbar arteries suture saccotomy was performed. The patient eventually died of multiorgan failure one month later. Conclusions The apparently "self-limiting" post-endovascular aneurysm repair CT-scan finding of periaortic hematoma may have represented a potential trigger for abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture. The possibility of developing undetected aortic lesions during endovascular aneurysm repair, specifically in the presence of potentially "at risk" anatomical conditions, should always be considered.

Takayasu's arteritis and acute type B aortic dissection treated with a stent graft	VASCULAR			English	Article						Takayasu&#8217; s arteritis; type b aortic dissection; thoracic stent graft		Objectives Takayasu's arteritis is a large vessel vasculitis which usually involves the aorta and its first generation branches. Aortic dissection, however, is a rare manifestation of Takayasu's arteritis and for this reason optimum management in both short and long term is unknown. Methods This is a case of a 31-year-old female presenting with acute type B AD in association with underlying TA which failed to respond to conservative management and underwent thoracic stent grafting (TEVAR). Results Despite successful coverage of the intimal breach in the thoracic aorta by TEVAR there were complications with delivery of the stent which required a conduit sutured to the right common iliac artery. Also post-TEVAR computed tomography showed a localised dissection of the origin of the left common carotid artery which may have been iatrogenic possibly due to the stiff guidewire used during delivery of the stent graft to the thoracic aorta. Conclusions The use of TEVAR for an acute type B AD in those with TA may be problematic.

VASCULAR			English	Article						Ischemia-reperfusion; kidneys; lower extremity	DISTANT ORGAN ISCHEMIA; PHENIRAMINE MALEATE; REPERFUSION INJURY; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PROTECTS; CELLS	Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the severity of kidney damage following lower limb ischemia-reperfusion and direct kidney ischemia-reperfusion. Methods Thirty Sprague Dawley male rats were randomly divided into three groups; lower extremity ischemia-reperfusion group (Group 2), renal ischemia-reperfusion group (Group 3) and control (anesthesia and median laparotomy only) (Group 1). In group 3, 1-h ischemia was performed on the kidney and in group 2, 1-h ischemia was performed on the left lower extremity. This procedure was followed by reperfusion for 24 h. Renal tissues were removed after the reperfusion period and the groups were evaluated for glutathioneperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde and GSH levels, and furthermore, their histolopathological scores were calculated. Results Renal malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher in Group 2 and Group 3 than they were in the Control group. There was no significant difference in renal malondialdehyde levels between Group 2 and Group 3. Kidney glutathione (GSH) levels were statistically lower in Group 2 and Group 3 than in the Control group. No statistically significant difference was found between Group 2 and Group 3 regarding their GSH levels. In histological evaluation, there was no statistically significant difference between Group 2 and Group 3 in terms of kidney damage score. Conclusions This study has identified that lower extremity ischemia induces remote kidney damage with similar features to kidney injury, occurring after direct kidney ischemia-reperfusion.

Methods This study conducted a retrospective review of patients with end-stage renal disease referred for hemodialysis AVF stenosis in one center. The study consisted of 114 patients with significant (significant stenosis was defined as a reduction in the caliber of the fistula vein of > 50% with respect to the non-aneurysmal venous segment). AVF stenosis patients were treated with PTA, with conventional balloon angioplasty. The NLR and PLR were calculated from the pre-interventional blood samples. The patients were classified into two groups: group A, primary patency < 12 months (n = 35) and group B, and primary patency >= 12 months (n = 79). Comparisons between the groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to compare the factors, NLR and PLR, for association with primary patency AVFs. A receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to identify the sensitivity and specificity of the NLR and PLR cut-off values in the prediction of primary patency time. Results There was no difference in gender; age; side of AVF; AVF type; comorbid diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension; or blood parameters such as white cell count, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, C-reactive protein, NLR, or PLR between the two groups (p > 0.05). There was also no significant difference in the patency rate between the NLR < 4.13 and NLR >= 4.13 groups at 12 months (NLR cut-off point = 4.13, p = 0.273). There were statistically significant differences between the primary patency rates of the PLR < 187.86 and PLR >= 187.86 groups at 12 months (PLR cut-off point = 187.86, p = 0.023). The cut-off value for PLR for the determination of primary patency was 187.86, with a sensitivity of 57.0% and specificity of 34.4%. Conclusion An increased level of PLR may be a risk factor for the development of early AVF restenosis after successful PTA. However, more studies are needed to validate this finding.

A retrospective study	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						chronic venous disease; obesity; quality of life; pain; C categories	DISEASE; OBESE	Objectives: The study aims to investigate the change in postoperative clinic, pain, and general quality of life of patients who were operated on due to chronic venous disease (CVD), according to their body mass index (BMI). Materials and methods: 150 patients (30-45 years) who were treated with cyanoacrylate embolization for CVD between January 2017 and February 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical (C) category of clinical, etiology, anatomy, and pathophysiology (CEAP) classification venous clinical severity score (VCSS) and visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaires were applied to the patients before and after the operation periodically. The patients were surveyed preoperatively and postoperatively at 1st, 6th, 12th, and 24th months. Results: The patients were divided into three groups according to their BMI. In the comparison between normal and overweight participants, venous reflux, CEAP C categories, and VAS scores were not statistically significantly different in preoperative and postoperative periods. In the comparison between normal and obese participants, CEAP C categories, VCSS, and VAS scores were statistically significantly different in postoperative periods. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of venous reflux preoperatively and postoperatively in all three groups. Conclusions: The study showed that the increase in BMI had negative effects on the CEAP C categories, pain, and quality of life independently of the venous reflux of CVD.

One-year results of stent graft repair for carotid artery pseudo-aneurysm in patients with Behcet's disease	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Stent graft; carotid artery; pseudo-aneurysm; Behcet&#8217; s disease	ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; FALSE ANEURYSM; PSEUDOANEURYSMS; MANIFESTATIONS; INVOLVEMENT; MANAGEMENT; LESIONS	Objectives Behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology with vascular complications. This study reviewed the mid-term outcome of Behcet's disease patients with carotid artery pseudo-aneurysms treated by endovascular stent-graft repair at our unit. Methods During a period of 11 years, six cases were included. Postoperative ultrasound duplex results were recorded along with computed tomography angiography report done a year after intervention. Results The mean age (+/- SD) was 38 (+/- 5.2) years. The mean (+/- SD) pseudo-aneurysm size was 33 (+/- 12.2) mm. Technical success was 83%; failed cannulation of the internal carotid artery was encountered in one case. On day 2 post-operative, a duplex ultrasound revealed complete exclusion and thrombosis of the false aneurysm in all cases. A year later, a computed tomography angiography revealed a primary patency rate of 80%, and only one case had a recurrent pseudo-aneurysm at the distal margin of the stent graft. All cases, however, had complete thrombosis in the pseudo-aneurysms lumen with a mean (+/- SD) regression in size of 18 (+/- 6) mm. The mean (+/- SD) percentage of in-stent stenosis was 34.5% (+/- 11.73%). Conclusions Stent graft repair for carotid artery pseudo-aneurysm in Behcet's disease patients might be the preferable first line of treatment since it had a high technical success and mid-term primary patency rates, with additional fact that it obviously avoids the hazardous complications of surgery.

The feasibility of low iodine dynamic CT angiography with test bolus for evaluation of lower extremity peripheral artery disease	VASCULAR			English	Article						Computed tomography angiography; four-dimensional computed tomography; blood circulation time; peripheral arterial disease; atherosclerosis		Objective This study aims to determine if low iodine dynamic computed tomography angiography performed after a fixed delay or test bolus acquisition demonstrates high concordance with clinical computed tomography angiography (using a routine amount of iodinated contrast) to display lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. Methods After informed consent, low iodine dynamic computed tomography angiography examination (using either a fixed delay or test bolus) using 50 ml of iodine contrast media was performed. A subsequent clinical computed tomography angiography using standard iodine dose (115 or 145 ml) served as the reference standard. A vascular radiologist reviewed dynamic and clinical computed tomography angiography images to categorize the lumen into "not opacified", "<50% stenosis", " 50 70% stenosis", ">70% stenosis", and "occluded" for seven arterial segments in each lower extremity. Concordance between low iodine dynamic computed tomography angiography and the routine iodine reference standard was calculated. The clinical utility of 4D volume-rendered images was also evaluated. Results Sixty-eight patients (average age 66.1 +/- 12.3 years, male; female = 49: 19) were enrolled, with 34 patients each undergoing low iodine dynamic computed tomography angiography using fixed delay and test bolus techniques, respectively. One patient assigned to the test bolus group did not undergo low iodine computed tomography angiography due to unavailable delayed time. The fixed delay was 13 s, with test bolus acquisition resulting in a mean variable delay prior to image acquisition of 19.5 s (range; 8-32 s). Run-off to the ankle was observed using low iodine dynamic computed tomography angiography following fixed delay and test bolus acquisition in 76.4% (26/34) and 100% (33/33) of patients, respectively (p = 0.005). Considering extremities with run-off to the ankle and without severe artifact, the concordance rate between low iodine dynamic computed tomography angiography and the routine iodine reference standard was 86.8% (310/357) using fixed delay and 97.9% (425/434) using test bolus (p < 0.001). 4D volume-rendered images using fixed delay and test bolus demonstrated asymmetric flow in 57.7% (15/26) and 58.1% (18/31) (p = 0.978) of patients, and collateral blood flow in 11.5% (3/26) and 22.6% (7/31) of patients (p = 0.319), respectively. Conclusion Low iodine dynamic computed tomography angiography with test bolus acquisition has a high concordance with routine peripheral computed tomography angiography performed with standard iodine dose, resulting in improved run-off to the ankle compared to dynamic computed tomography angiography performed after a fixed delay. This method is useful for minimizing iodine dose in patients at risk for contrast-induced nephropathy. 4D volume-rendered computed tomography angiography images provide useful dynamic information.

Critical limb ischemia patients clinically improving with medical treatment have lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios	VASCULAR			English	Article						Peripheral arterial disease; iloprost; inflammation; neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio; platelet-lymphocyte ratio	PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL-DISEASE; INFLAMMATION; AMPUTATION; SURVIVAL; ILOPROST	Objectives Inflammation is a component in the pathogenesis of critical limb ischemia. We aimed to assess how inflammation affects response to treatment in patients treated for critical limb ischemia using neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocytes ratios (PLR) as markers of inflammation. Methods Patients in a single tertiary cardiovascular center with critical limb ischemia unsuitable for surgical or interventional revascularization were retrospectively identified. Data were collected on medical history for risk factors, previous surgical or endovascular revascularization, and outcome. A standard regimen of low molecular weight heparin, aspirin, statins, iloprost infusions, and a standard pain medication protocol were applied to each patient per hospital protocol. Patients with improvement in ischemic pain and healed ulcers made up the responders group and cases with no worsening pain or ulcer size or progression to minor or major amputations made up the non-responders group. Responders and Non-responders were compared for risk factors including pretreatment NLR and PLR. Results 268 included patients who were not candidates for surgical or endovascular revascularization were identified. Responders had significantly lower pretreatment NLR (4.48 vs 8.47, p < 0.001) and PLR (162.19 vs 225.43, p = 0.001) values. After controlling for associated risk factors NLR >= 4.63 (p < 0.001) and PLR >= 151.24 (p = 0.016) were independently associated with no response to treatment. Conclusions Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocytes ratio are markers of inflammation that are reduced in patients improving with medical treatment suggesting a decreased state of inflammation before treatment in responding patients.

J	Parker, MH; Mukherjee, D; Ryan, L				Parker, Michael H.; Mukherjee, Dipankar; Ryan, Liam			Management of large bore access complications in the era of trans-catheter aortic valve replacement	VASCULAR			English	Article						Vascular access complications; trans-catheter aortic valve replacement; femoral access; stents; vascular surgical procedures		Objectives Trans-catheter aortic valve replacement is a commonplace procedure for patients with aortic valvular stenosis who are at a high risk for surgery, evidenced by the 34,892 trans-catheter aortic valve replacements performed in 2016. Trans-catheter aortic valve replacement's rate of major vascular complications with second-generation closure devices is 4.5% according to a meta-analysis of 10,822 patients. To manage those complications, percutaneous approaches to arterial repairs show shorter length of stay, higher rate of direct to home discharge and equivalent outcomes at long-term follow-up. This study's goal is to show that one center's vascular access strategy can decrease open repairs and improve patient outcomes. Methods Our team began accessing the mid-common femoral artery at least 1-2 cm proximal to the takeoff of the profunda femoris. This allowed an endovascular stent to be deployed if necessary via contralateral femoral access. We performed a completion angiogram following every trans-catheter aortic valve replacement to ensure no arterial complications. We conducted a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database for all trans-catheter aortic valve replacement cases at a tertiary care center from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2018. Results A total of 699 trans-catheter aortic valve replacement procedures were performed with 25/31 (80.6%) cases met inclusion criteria. An increase was noted in the number of stent procedures versus cutdown procedures over time (P < 0.001). A decrease was noted in the number of vascular surgery team activations following trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (P = 0.004). A non-significant trend was noted toward a shorter median length of stay for the stent group (P = 0.149). There was no increase in 30-day mortality rate (0.0% for both groups) or 30-day readmissions (4/15 (26.7%) for stents vs. 2/10 (20.0%) for open repairs; P > 0.999). Conclusions This strategy is safe and feasible to implement and reduces the number of open repairs following trans-catheter aortic valve replacement, activation of surgical resources, and possibly the length of stay.

Outcomes of thoracic endovascular aortic repair in thoracic aortic aneurysm and penetrating aortic ulcer using the Conformable Gore TAG within and outside the instructions for use	VASCULAR			English	Article						TEVAR; instructions for use; thoracic aortic aneurysm; penetrating aortic ulcer; reintervention; outcome	ENDURANT STENT-GRAFT; II ENDOLEAKS; ARCH; EXPERIENCE; LABEL; INTERVENTIONS; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS; HOSTILE	Objective To describe the outcome of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in thoracic aortic aneurysm and penetrating aortic ulcer with respect to instructions for use status. Methods Between October 2009 and September 2017, a total of 532 patients underwent TEVAR; of which 195 have been treated using the Conformable GORE (R) TAG (R) thoracic endoprosthesis (CTAG). Fifty-six patients of this cohort underwent TEVAR for thoracic aortic aneurysm/penetrating aortic ulcer using the CTAG. Depending on the preoperative computed tomography angiography findings, patients were classified as inside or outside the device's instructions for use. All inside instruction for use patients underwent postoperative reclassification regarding the instructions for use status. Study endpoints included TEVAR-related reintervention, exclusion of the pathology (endoleak type I/III), TEVAR-related mortality, and graft-related serious adverse events. The median duration of follow-up was 29.7 months (range: 0-109.4 months). Results Of the 56 patients, 17 were primarily classified as outside instruction for use, and in additional 13 patients, TEVAR was performed outside instruction for use, leading to 30 outside instruction for use patients (53.6%). Twenty-six patients (46.4%) were treated inside instruction for use. Reintervention-free survival was lower in outside instruction for use patients (P = 0.016) with a hazard ratio of 9.74 (confidence interval 1.2-80.2; P = 0.034) for TEVAR-related reintervention. With respect to endoleak type I/III, relevant difference was detected between inside/outside instruction for use status (P = 0.012). The serious adverse event rate was 30.4%, mainly in outside instruction for use patients (P = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis indicated an association between graft-related serious adverse event/instructions for use status (odds ratio 6.11; confidence interval 1.6-30.06; P = 0.012). In-hospital death was seen more frequently in outside instruction for use patients (P = 0.12) as was procedure-related death (log-rank test: P = 0.21). Conclusion TEVAR for thoracic aortic aneurysm/penetrating aortic ulcer is frequently performed outside instruction for use despite preoperative inside instruction for use eligibility, leading to important consequences for technical/clinical outcome. Instructions for use adherence in TEVAR should be of interest for further large-scale studies.

J	Wang, TH; Zhao, JC; Yuan, D				Wang, Tiehao; Zhao, Jichun; Yuan, Ding			Successful surgical management of a ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm with acute common peroneal nerve neuropathy: A rare case	VASCULAR			English	Article						Ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm; neuropathy; common peroneal nerve; open surgical repair; glucocorticoid	REPAIR	Objectives Ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm is a rare entity, which can cause severe nerve neuropathy. Open surgical repair is the preferred treatment for ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm but may aggravate nerve injuries or lead to postoperative aneurysm enlargement. The current surgical techniques for ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm have some deficiencies. Methods We present the case of a 78-year-old woman with sudden swelling of left knee joint and left foot drop, which was caused by the ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm and its compression. A modified open surgical repair was applied in our case, and glucocorticoid therapy was given perioperatively. Results The motor function of left lower limb had rapidly recovered after operation, and six-month follow-up showed patency of prosthetic vessel and significant shrinkage of aneurysm sac. Conclusions Our modified open surgical repair can relieve the compression and prevent possible "type II endoleak" without dissecting in popliteal fossa. Acute common peroneal nerve neuropathy and foot drop are reversible with immediate removal of compression and glucocorticoid therapy for patients with ruptured popliteal artery aneurysm.

VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						EVAR; endoleak Ia; custom-made; inner branches; complex endovascular aortic repair; iBEVAR	ENDOVASCULAR ANEURYSM REPAIR; GRAFTS; MANAGEMENT	Objectives We represent two cases of late proximal type I endoleak following EVAR with aneurysm expansion that were treated with a custom-made graft with inner branches. Methods Two patients of 87 and 82 years old were operated by EVAR 6 and 8 years ago for abdominal aortic aneurysm. Both had proximal type I endoleak with aneurysm sac expansion. Open surgery had a high risk, and a proximal aortic extension with a simple aortic cuff was not possible neither because previous EVAR grafts were already at the level of the renal arteries. A custom-made endograft with inner branches was planned as a fenestrated graft was not technically possible. Results We successfully treated both patients using a custom-made graft with four inner branches from Jotec (Cryolife, Kennesaw, GA). Three months' follow-up CT scan did not show any endoleaks. All target vessels were patent with good conformability of the bridging stents. Conclusion The treatment of proximal type I endoleak using inner branches' endografts is feasible. This novel technology might broaden the indications for complex aortic repair in a group of patients where fenestrated endografts are not possible.	[Gemayel, Gino G. G.; Montessuit, Michel M.

Abdominal aortic endograft infection with Clostridium difficile	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Clostridium difficile; aortic endograft infection; abdominal aortic aneurysm	STENT-GRAFT INFECTION; ANEURYSM; OUTCOMES; SEPTICUM	Objectives The increase in endovascular aortic aneurysm repair has led to increasing incidence of aortic endograft infections. Additionally, more atypical organisms are being identified as pathogens. We report on a rare aortic endograft infection to further characterize and understand these infections. Methods We report a Clostridium difficile culture-positive aortic endograft infection in an 82-year-old male 3 years after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Results The patient underwent successful open, complete explant of his endograft and in-situ repair using a rifampin-soaked Dacron graft. He continues to do well. Conclusions Aortic endograft infections are a complex problem further complicated by rare and virulent infections. Unless the patient is at prohibitive risk, the management of infected aortic endografts is surgical graft explant and in-situ or extra-anatomic reconstruction due to the exceedingly high mortality rate with non-operative management.

Direct oral anticoagulants decrease treatment failure for acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						deep venous thrombosis; direct oral anticoagulant; duplex ultrasound	DABIGATRAN; THERAPY	Objective Optimal medical therapy for acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) remains an enigma. While clinical trials demonstrate non-inferiority with an oral anti-Xa inhibitor, or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), versus combined low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and oral vitamin K antagonist (VKA), the most effective regimen remains to be determined. Methods This study is a single-center retrospective cohort study from October 2014 to December 2015 of patients with a diagnosis of acute DVT and subsequent serial lower extremity venous duplex. Demographics, medical history, medications, serial ultrasound findings, as well as the primary anticoagulant used for treatment were collected and analyzed by two independent data extractors. Treatment failure was defined as any new DVT or progression of an existing DVT within 3 months of diagnosis of the index clot. Risk factors for treatment failure were assessed using standard odds ratios and Fischer's exact test. Results Among 496 patients with an acute lower extremity DVT, 54% (n = 266) were men, mean age was 61 years, 35% (n = 174) involved the popliteal or more proximal segments, and 442 had documentation of the primary treatment for DVT: 20% (n = 90) received nothing; 20% (n = 92) received an oral VKA; 34% (n = 149) received a DOAC; 20% (n = 90) received LMWH; and 5% (n = 21) received another class of anticoagulant. Within 3 months, 21% (n=89 out of 427) had treatment failure defined as any new DVT or progression of prior DVT. Patients treated with a DOAC were less likely to experience treatment failure when compared with any other treatment (odds ratio 0.43; 95% confidence intervals [0.23, 0.79]; p = 0.0069) and when compared with traditional oral VKA (OR 0.44; 95% CI [0.21, 0.92]; p = 0.029). None of prior history of DVT, pulmonary embolism, thrombophilia, renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, cancer, or antiplatelet therapy correlated with treatment failure. Treatment outcome did not correlate with being on any anticoagulation versus none (p = 0.74), nor did it correlate with the duration of treatment (<3 months versus >= 3 months) (p = 0.42). Proximal and distal DVTs showed no difference in treatment failure (19% versus 22%, respectively; p = 0.43). Conclusion In summary, the use of a DOAC for acute lower extremity DVT yielded better overall outcomes and fewer treatment failures at 3 months as compared to traditional oral VKA therapy based on serial duplex imaging.

Next-generation sequencing in a large pedigree segregating visceral artery aneurysms suggests potential role of COL4A1/COL4A2 in disease etiology	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Aneurysm; genetic susceptibility; non-coding variants; next-generation sequencing	COL4A2 MUTATIONS; MISSENSE MUTATION; MARFAN-SYNDROME; IV; STABILITY; BRAIN; GENE; IDENTIFICATION; HETEROGENEITY; MECHANISMS	Background Visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs) can be fatal if ruptured. Although a relatively rare incident, it holds a contemporary mortality rate of approximately 12%. VAAs have multiple possible causes, one of which is genetic predisposition. Here, we present a striking family with seven individuals affected by VAAs, and one individual affected by a visceral artery pseudoaneurysm. Methods We exome sequenced the affected family members and the parents of the proband to find a possible underlying genetic defect. As exome sequencing did not reveal any feasible protein-coding variants, we combined whole-genome sequencing of two individuals with linkage analysis to find a plausible non-coding culprit variant. Variants were ranked by the deep learning framework DeepSEA. Results Two of seven top-ranking variants, NC_000013.11:g.108154659C>T and NC_000013.11:g.110409638C>T, were found in all VAA-affected individuals, but not in the individual affected by the pseudoaneurysm. The second variant is in a candidate cis-regulatory element in the fourth intron of COL4A2, proximal to COL4A1. Conclusions As type IV collagens are essential for the stability and integrity of the vascular basement membrane and involved in vascular disease, we conclude that COL4A1 and COL4A2 are strong candidates for VAA susceptibility genes.

Visceral segment aortic thrombus is associated with proximal aortic degeneration after infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Infrarenal aortic aneurysm; aortic thrombus; visceral aortic aneurysm	ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR; NECK ENLARGEMENT; DETERMINANTS; DILATATION; OPERATIONS; BYPASS; RISK	Objective To identify predictors of aortic aneurysm formation at or above an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Methods A total of 881 infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs were identified at a single institution from 2004 to 2008; 187 of the repairs were identified that had pre-operative and post-operative computed tomography imaging at least one year or greater to evaluate for aortic degeneration following repair. Aortic diameters at the celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries were measured on all available computed tomographic scans. Aortic thrombus and calcification volumes in the visceral and infrarenal abdominal aortic segments were calculated. Multivariable modeling was used with log transformed variables to determine potential predictors of future aortic aneurysm development after infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Results Of the 187 patients in the cohort, 100 had an open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair while 87 were treated with endovascular repair. Proximal aortic aneurysms developed in 26% (n = 49) of the cohort during an average of 72 +/- 34.2 months of follow-up. After multivariable modeling, visceral segment aortic thrombus on pre-operative computed tomography imaging increased the risk of aortic aneurysm development above the infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair within both the open abdominal aortic aneurysm (hazard ratio 2.04, p = 0.033) and endovascular repair (hazard ratio 3.31, p = 0.004) cohorts. Endovascular repair was independently associated with a higher risk of future aortic aneurysm development after infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair when compared to open abdominal aortic aneurysm (hazard ratio 2.19, p = 0.025). Conclusions Visceral aortic thrombus present prior to abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and endovascular repair are both associated with an increased risk of future proximal aortic degeneration after infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. These factors may predict patients at higher risk of developing proximal aortic aneurysms that may require complex aortic repairs.

Systematic review with pooled data analysis reveals the need for a standardized reporting protocol including the visceral vessels during fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (FEVAR)	VASCULAR			English	Review; Early Access						Complex aortic aneurysm; fenestrated; pararenal aortic aneurysm; juxtarenal aortic aneurysm; superior mesenteric artery	ANEURYSM REPAIR; GRAFT COMPLEXITY; OUTCOMES; ENDOGRAFTS; OPTION	Objectives: To collect and analyse the available evidence in the outcomes of patients treated with fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (f-EVAR) technique focusing specifically on visceral vessel outcomes. Methods: The current meta-analysis was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. All the studies reporting the f-EVAR technique for the management of degenerative pararenal and/or type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) were considered eligible for inclusion in the study. The main study outcomes (technical success, type I endoleaks, fracture or occlusion of the bridging stents, overall aneurysmrelated mortality, and the reintervention rate) were subsequently expressed as proportions and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Fourteen studies with a total of 1804 patients were included in a pooled analysis. The technical success of the procedure was 95.97% (95%CI = 92.35-98.60). Intraoperatively, the pooled proportion of reported type I endoleak was 7.6% (95%CI = 2.52-14.60) while during a median follow-up of 41 months (range 11-96) follow-up period the pooled rate of fracture and occlusion of the bridging stents was 2.79% (95%CI = 0.00-8.52) and 4.46% (95%CI = 1.93-7.77), respectively. The overall aneurysm-related mortality was detected to be 0.63% (95%CI = 0.04-1.63), and the pooled estimate for re-intervention rate was 15.69%. Conclusions: Fenestrated endovascular repair for p-AAA is an effective and safe treatment. Target vessel complications and endoleaks remain the two most important concerns for fenestrated endovascular procedures, contributing to most of the secondary interventions. The lack of computed tomography angiography follow-up evaluation does not allow us to draw robust conclusions about the complication rates for the superior mesenteric artery during f-EVAR. Due to the potential implications of SMA complications on aneurysm-related mortality, standardized reporting of short- and long-term target visceral vessel outcomes is required.

Bifurcated bypasses could be considered as an option when an endovascular approach is not feasible or has already failed and a single bypass would not allow direct revascularization of the ischaemic area. Bifurcated bypasses are characterized by landing on two different arteries, the main artery (in direct continuity with the foot vessels) and the secondary one (perfusing the angiosome district). The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of bifurcated bypass in chronic limb threatening ischaemia. Methods Thirty-five patients were consecutively treated with a bifurcated bypass for chronic limb threatening ischaemia from January 2014 to December 2019 in a single vascular surgery centre. Data from clinical records and operative registers were collected prospectively in an electronic database and retrospectively analysed. Primary and primary assisted bypass patency, amputation-free survival, morbidity and mortality rates at 12 and 24 months were analysed. Results Mean follow-up period was 25.1 months (range 2-72 months). Thirty-six bifurcated bypasses were performed on 35 patients (age 75.3 +/- 7.2 years; 69.4% were male). According to Wound, Ischemia, foot Infection classification 22.2% belonged to stage 3 and 77.8% to stage 4 and the mean Rutherford's class was 5.1 +/- 0.7. Immediate technical success was 100%. Early mortality and morbidity rates were respectively 5.5%, and 33.3%; foot surgery was performed in 50% of cases with wound healing in all patients. Primary patency and primary assisted bypass patency were 96.7% and 100% at 6 months; 85.2% and 92% at 12 months, 59.9% and 73.4% at 24 months, respectively. Amputation-free survival at 12 and 24 months was, respectively, 95.6% and 78.8%. Overall survival rates at 12 and 24 months were respectively 94.4% and 91.6%. Conclusions Bifurcates bypass can provide good results in patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia without endovascular option, especially in diabetic ones. Bifurcated bypass is a complex surgical solution, both to be planned and performed, and it is quite invasive for frail patients that should be accurately selected.

Methods The patients with acute lower limb ischemia who underwent percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy between August 2016 and February 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were diagnosed by clinical examination and computed tomography angiography. The percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy was performed as the initial thrombus removal method, followed by anticoagulation therapy. The patients were followed up by clinical examination, imaging, and ankle brachial index (ABI) examination. Results Thirty-two patients (21 males, 11 females; average age of 68.53 +/- 8.05; three cases of grade III, 29 cases of grade IIB) were reviewed. Recanalization of the thromboembolic occlusions were achieved in all patients. ABI significantly (p < 0.01) increased postoperatively (preoperative ABI: 0.51 +/- 0.13; postoperative ABI: 0.85 +/- 0.65, ABI at three months postoperatively: 0.84 +/- 0.66). Eleven patients underwent balloon dilation and three patients had stent placement. Complete thrombus removal was achieved in all patients. The primary patency at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively was 90%, 85%, and 56%, respectively. The secondary patency at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively was 93%, 87%, and 65%, respectively. Conclusions The immediate result appeared to be effective to use percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy as the first thrombus removal method in the treatment of acute thromboembolic occlusions in the lower extremity, while the midterm result needs to be further improved.

Nonetheless, an evaluation of the literature on the broader domains of oral health in individuals with peripheral vascular disorders is lacking. This systematic review aims to collate the current evidence on the oral health status of individuals with peripheral vascular disorders. Methods Five electronic databases were searched for studies assessing oral health parameters in individuals with peripheral vascular disorders. Outcome measures considered were periodontal health, dentition status, caries indices, oral prostheses, oral pathologies and oral hygiene behaviours. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to appraise the quality of the studies. Results From 3025 records identified, 24 studies involving 1232 participants with peripheral vascular disorders were included in this review. In nine studies, periodontitis was significantly more prevalent in peripheral vascular disorders compared to non-peripheral vascular disorders participants. A further six studies reported individuals with peripheral vascular disorders also had significantly fewer teeth and increased rates of edentulism. Only one study reported a higher incidence of dental caries in peripheral vascular disorders participants. Other aspects of oral health such as oral prosthesis, oral pathology and oral hygiene behaviours were seldom assessed. Conclusions The scarcity of studies reporting on broader domains limited our ability to arrive at a conclusion regarding the oral health status of individuals with peripheral vascular disorders.

J	Chaudhuri, A; Badawy, A				Chaudhuri, Arindam; Badawy, Ayman			Endograft platform does not influence aortic neck dilatation after infrarenal endovascular aneurysm repair with primary endostapling	VASCULAR			English	Article						Endovascular aneurysm repair; EndoAnchors; aortic neck dilatation; stents; endograft fixation	STENT-GRAFT MIGRATION; DEVICE MIGRATION; FIXATION; ENDOANCHORS; TERM; PREVENTION; ENDOLEAK	Objectives: Aortic endografts used for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) are based on varying skeletal platforms such as stainless steel or nitinol stents, using radial force applied to seal at the aneurysm neck, and varying proximal fixation methods, applying either suprarenal or infrarenal fixation. This study assesses whether varying skeleton/fixation platforms affect neck-related outcomes after primary endostapling with Heli-FX EndoAnchors at EVAR. Methods: Retrospective analysis of a prospective database of infrarenal EVAR undertaken at a single centre. Chimney-EVAR, secondary cases were excluded. Primary outcomes analysed included neck diameter evolution from pre-EVAR to latest imaging follow-up, including a comparison of stent platforms to see if there was any outcome difference between those using stainless steel or nitinol, as also freedom from type I endoleakage and migration. Secondary outcomes assessed included average number of EndoAnchors, and sac size patterns before and after EVAR. Results: A total of 101 patients underwent endostapled infrarenal EVAR between September 2013 and March 2020. After exclusion of ineligible patients, 84 patients (76 male, 8 female, age 73.7 +/- 7.8 years) were available for analysis. 57/27 endografts used suprarenal/infrarenal fixation, whilst 16/68 devices were based on stainless steel/nitinol platforms, respectively. Mean oversizing was higher for stainless steel/suprarenal fixation endografts (p = 0.02). A total of 582 EndoAnchors were deployed, averaging 7 +/- 2 per patient. Median neck diameter was 25 mm (IQR 22-31) with 22 necks having non-parallel morphology (conical, tapered or bubble). Median follow-up period was 28.5 (IQR 12-43) months. Neck evolution studies suggested aortic neck dilatation of 5 +/- 4 mm (p <0.001, paired T-test), independent of platforms employed (p = NS, ANOVA). There was no endograft migration; one immediate post-EVAR endoleak settled by eight weeks. There was a mean 5.7 +/- 8.2 mm sac size reduction (p < 0.001, paired T-test). Conclusion: Aortic neck dilatation occurs after EVAR with primary endostapling, but the process may be independent of stainless steel/nitinol platforms, possibly due to the attenuating effect of EndoAnchors. Adjunct aneurysm neck fixation by primary endostapling prevents migration regardless of whether suprarenal/infrarenal fixation is the primary fixative method. Device platform choice therefore may be left to the operator discretion if primary endostapling is applied at EVAR. Freedom from complications such as migration and endoleakage in the intermediate term suggests a higher level of 'tolerance' to aortic neck dilatation with primary endostapling. We would therefore suggest routine usage of EndoAnchors at EVAR when not otherwise contraindicated.

Methods One hundred patients with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (a study group) and 100 control subjects were included in this prospective case-control study. Participants' baseline clinical characteristics and laboratory data including some oxidant/antioxidant status parameters such as albumin, ferroxidase and myeloperoxidase, and thiol/disulphide homeostasis parameters such as native thiol, total thiol and disulphide, as well as native thiol/total thiol, disulphide/native thiol and disulphide/total thiol ratios were all recorded and then compared between the groups. Results Mean albumin and ferroxidase, and median myeloperoxidase levels were found to be significantly higher in patients with the peripheral arterial disease than in control group (p = 0.045,p = 0.000 andp = 0.000, respectively). Mean native thiol and total thiol, and median disulphide levels were found to be significantly lower in the study group as compared with the control group (p = 0.000,p = 0.000 andp = 0.037, respectively). According to the results of logistic regression analysis, systolic blood pressure, ferroxidase and myeloperoxidase levels were detected to be the independent predictors of peripheral arterial disease. Conclusion Our report is the first one in the literature investigating dynamic thiol/disulphide homeostasis metrics as a novel risk factor of oxidative stress in peripheral arterial disease. Dynamic thiol/disulphide homeostasis metrics may be used as a valuable risk factor of oxidative stress in patients with the peripheral arterial disease since it is readily available, easily calculated and relatively cheap.

Methods Between January 2020 and February 2021, 100 Mynx Control devices were deployed in 91 consecutive patients (mean age: 67.5 +/- 16.9 years) who underwent peripheral arterial procedures. We used ultrasound and/or fluoroscopy during Mynx Control deployment and ultrasound post-procedure to detect complications. Femoral artery punctures included 62 (62%) antegrade and 38 (38%) retrograde punctures. The mean activated clotting time at time of device deployment was 221s. The primary endpoints were technical success, device failure, and complication rates up to 30 days. Results A 5F vascular sheath was used in 43 cases (43%) (36 (36%) 6F and 21 (21%) 7F). The majority of our cases had antegrade access (62%). Overall technical success rate was 97% in both antegrade and retrograde cases. In total, there were 4 minor complications: 3 (3%) cases of pseudoaneurysm and 1 (1%) case of haematoma. No major complications were recorded post-procedure or 30 days post index procedure. Conclusion The Mynx Control vascular closure device is safe and effective in achieving haemostasis in patients undergoing antegrade and retrograde peripheral angioplasty procedures.

LIs have been shown in previous studies to have higher groin complications though these were undertaken in multiple types of vascular procedures. We looked at wound complications for patients undergoing elective CFE procedures only with or without angioplasty via TI or LI. Methods All patients who had undergone CFE were retrospectively analysed from a prospective database. Length of stay, wound complications and readmission rates were recorded. Factors for wound complication were looked at using logistic regression with backward elimination. Results 122 CFE procedures were performed (30 TI) over the study period. 92 (76.7%) of patients had a prosthetic patch used, whilst 57 (46.7%) patients underwent an adjunctive endovascular procedure, namely, iliac angioplasty and stenting. Median length of stay was 3 days for both groups. The wound complication rate was 6.7% in the TI group and 22.6% in the LI group. 85.6% of the wound complications were identified after discharge. 6/122 (4.9%) were readmitted for intravenous antibiotics, whilst others were managed in the outpatient setting. TI (aOR = 0.15; 95% 0.03-0.75) and combined open FE with endovascular revascularisation (aOR = 0.33; 95% 0.11-0.95) had protective effects on wound complications. Type of the patch used was not associated with any wound complications (p = 0.07). Conclusion Compared to traditional LI, TI for CFE and OTA have lower risk of wound complications and reduced readmission rates in our series. We advocate adopting TI as the standard for femoral artery procedures rather than LI.

Interestingly, only one study reported a case of intercostal aneurysm caused by an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Here, we report the case of a patient with non-ruptured isolated giant true IAA caused by an AVF (size, 28 x 41 mm). Methods Treatment options for IAA include open surgery and endovascular treatment (EVT). We chose EVT, as it is minimally invasive. The right 11th intercostal artery and aneurysm diverged from the aorta. Two outflow arteries, one inflow artery, and an AVF from the aneurysm were confirmed, and coil embolization was performed. The artery of Adamkiewicz did not communicate with the right 11th intercostal artery. We performed angiography and confirmed occlusion of IAA with endoleak. Results There were no clinical findings indicative of spinal cord infarction after treatment. The patient did not develop complications and was discharged the day after treatment. Endoleak was not observed on computed tomography angiography findings at 1 month after treatment. Conclusions In our patient, an AVF might have caused IAA. Endovascular treatment for non-ruptured isolated giant IAA is a safe and minimally-invasive treatment. We found that performing EVT is beneficial when the size of the IAA exceeds 30 mm.

J	Lawrie, K; Whitley, A; Balaz, P				Lawrie, Katerina; Whitley, Adam; Balaz, Peter			A systematic review and meta-analysis on the management of concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysms and renal tumours	VASCULAR			English	Review; Early Access						Renal tumour; abdominal aortic aneurysm; nephrectomy; aneurysm repair; endovascular aneurysm repair	SURGICAL REPAIR; CELL CARCINOMA; NEPHRECTOMY; NEOPLASM	Objectives The treatment of concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysms and renal tumours is controversial. The aim of this study was to ascertain which of the following three strategies, one-stage open aneurysm repair and nephrectomy, two-stage open aneurysm repair and nephrectomy or two-stage endovascular aneurysm repair and nephrectomy, is the best approach. Methods systematic review and meta-analysis of articles published between January 1992 and April 2021 describing the treatment of concomitant abdominal aortic aneurysms and renal tumours. Results A total of 1168 records were identified. After the selection process, 12 studies with data on 89 patients were included. Sixty-two patients underwent one-stage open procedures, 18 patients underwent two-stage open procedures and nine underwent two-stage endovascular procedures. The overall postoperative mortality was 0.82% (95% CI, 0.00-4.61). The postoperative mortality for one-stage open procedures was 3.09% (95% CI, 0.00-10.11). No deaths occurred in the postoperative period open two-stage procedures or two-stage endovascular procedures. The weighted postoperative morbidity for all procedures was 23.86% (95% CI, 12.64-35.08) and for open one-stage procedures was 37.40% (95% CI, 14.33-60.47). Data concerning postoperative complications of two-stage open procedures were extractable from only one patient in whom no complications were reported. Two postoperative complications were reported after two-stage endovascular procedures from a total of six patients with extractable postoperative data. We were unable to perform meta-analysis on long-term outcomes as the data were reported non-uniformly. Conclusion There is currently no evidence to suggest that any procedure is associated with better outcomes. However, a one-stage open approach was the most commonly used option, favoured as it avoids delaying treatment of either of the conditions. Two-stage open procedures were preferred in cases where the surgical risk of a one-stage procedure was higher than the potential benefit. For such cases, two-stage endovascular repair is becoming more popular as a less invasive approach.

Methods Eighty three-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into four groups: a control group, a 0.06% beta-aminopropionitrile group, a 0.08% beta-aminopropionitrile group and a 0.1% beta-aminopropionitrile group. Initial experiments were performed on the control group, which was not treated with beta-aminopropionitrile (and drank water freely), and the other three groups, which were given different concentrations of beta-aminopropionitrile solution daily (0.06%, 0.08% and 0.1%). Subsequently, on the 40th day, osmotic minipumps administering 1 mu g/kg per min angiotensin II (Ang II) were implanted subcutaneously into the beta-aminopropionitrile groups, while the control group was continuously pumped with normal saline. The rats were euthanized 48 h after implantation. All rats that died before the expected end time of the experiment were autopsied immediately, and the aortas were dissected. The rats surviving at the end of the experiment were sacrificed by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital, and tissue samples were harvested for further analyses. Results The mean survival days were significantly different among the groups, with 39.1 +/- 6.04 days in the 0.08% beta-aminopropionitrile group and 32.7 +/- 9.85 days in the 0.1% beta-aminopropionitrile group (P = 0.0178) at the end of the experiment. Compared with those in the 0.06% beta-aminopropionitrile group, the rates of aortic dissection were significantly higher in the 0.08% beta-aminopropionitrile group and the 0.1% beta-aminopropionitrile group (P = 0.0015 and P = 0.0005, respectively), while there was no significant difference between the 0.08% beta-aminopropionitrile group and the 0.1% beta-aminopropionitrile group (P = 0.723) at 70% and 75%, respectively. However, the rupture rates were significantly different between the 0.08% beta-aminopropionitrile group and the 0.1% beta-aminopropionitrile group (55% versus 20%, P = 0.022). Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the aortic tissue sections of the beta-aminopropionitrile group showed that red blood cells entered the pseudocavity in the vascular wall, while the vascular wall structure of the control group was intact. Compared with control rats, which were intact and free from fracture, beta-aminopropionitrile-treated rats had fewer collagen fibers and exhibited fracture. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the aortic intimae of the aortic dissection rats showed double lumens and intimal tears. Conclusions An aortic dissection model with a high incidence and low mortality was successfully and stably developed with 0.08% beta-aminopropionitrile. This model will enable further studies investigating aortic dissection pathogenesis and drug therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging may be a reliable technique for imaging the aorta in rats.

Major lower extremity amputations in a developing country: 10-Year experience at a tertiary medical center	VASCULAR			English	Article						Amputation; survival; lower extremity; functional outcomes	LOWER-LIMB AMPUTATION; LONG-TERM MORTALITY; FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES; REHABILITATION; PREVALENCE; CONSENSUS	Background Lower extremity amputation (LEA) is a major surgical procedure with a high risk of significant morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to describe mortality and functionality outcomes following this procedure in a developing country. Methods This is a retrospective study of all patients undergoing LEA for non-traumatic etiology between 2007 and 2017. Medical records were used to retrieve demographics, comorbidities, and perioperative complications of identified patients. Patients were contacted to follow-up on their medical, postoperative care, and ambulatory status. Mortality and postoperative functionality rates were analyzed. Results The study included 78 patients. Median follow-up duration was 24 months. Hypertension (81%) and diabetes (79%) were the most common comorbidities. Mortality rates at 30 days, 1, and 5 years were 10.3, 29.2, and 65.5%, respectively. Mortality was significantly associated with age > 70 at amputation (p = 0.042), hypertension (p = 0.003), chronic kidney disease (p = 0.031), and perioperative sepsis (p = 0.01). Only 1.6% of patients were discharged into a specialized care center, and only 27% of patients were ambulatory postoperatively, although 90.5% were fitted with a prosthesis. Conclusions Survival following major amputation in a developing country is currently comparable to more developed regions of the world. Major discrepancy seems to exist in ambulatory status following the procedure. Discharge placement policies should be properly set, and rehabilitation centers funding should be increased. Awareness may also be warranted to educate patients and families about the value and positive impact of rehabilitation centers.

Open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with incidental finding of an extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma of the organ of Zuckerkandl	VASCULAR			English	Article						AAA; symptomatic aortic aneurysm; organ of Zuckerkandl; paraganglioma; pheochromocytoma; open surgical repair	PARAGANGLIOMA; RESECTION	Objectives Pheochromocytomas are rare catecholamine-secreting neuroendocrine tumors that arise from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla or extra-adrenal paraganglia. The most common location of these tumors is within the adrenal medulla. Extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas (EAPs) may occur in any portion of the paraganglion system. The most common location of EAPs is at the organ of Zuckerkandl, which is a collection of chromaffin cells near the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery. Methods We present a case of an EAP of the organ of Zuckerkandl incidentally discovered and resected during urgent open repair of a symptomatic 6.7-cm juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Results The patient underwent successful open surgical repair of a juxtarenal AAA and resection of the pheochromocytoma. Conclusions Concomitant pheochromocytomas and abdominal aortic aneurysms are rare, with a small number described in the literature. We describe the case of a simultaneous EAP of the organ of Zuckerkandl and AAA repair. This case demonstrates that these lesions can be safely resected in the same setting as AAA repair.

Methods A single-centre prospective data collection on (n = 250) EVAR cases withn = 26 preoperative attributes (factors) on endpoint of endoleak (types I-VI), occlusion, migration and mortality over a 13-year period was conducted. In addition to the traditional statistical analysis, data was subjected to machine learning algorithm through artificial neural network. The predictive accuracy (specificity and -1 sensitivity) on each endpoint is presented with percentage and receiver operative curve. The pattern recognition and model classification were conducted using discriminate analysis, decision tree, logistic regression, naive Bayes and support vector machines, and the best fit model was deployed for pattern recognition and modelling. Results The accuracy of the training, validation and predictive ability of artificial neural network in detection of endoleak type I was 95, 96 and 94%, type II (94, 83, 90 and 82%) and type III was 96, 94 and 96%, respectively. Endpoints are associated with increase in weights through predictive modeling that were not detected through statistical analytics. The overall accuracy of the model was >86%. Conclusion The study highlights the applicability, accuracy and reliability of artificial intelligence in the detection of adverse outcomes post-EVAR for an accurate surveillance stratification.

Results of a three-year follow-up after endovascular therapy with multilayer flow modulator in complex thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm: A case report	VASCULAR			English	Article						Abdominal; aortic aneurysm; multilayer flow modulator; thoracic	MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES; REPAIR; STENTS	Objectives Studies on the short-, medium and long-term effects of flow guiding stents are still limited. In this case report, we present three-year follow-up of the multilayer flow modulator stent in a 55-year-old patient with Crawford Type 2 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Methods A 55-year-old male patient with Crawford Type 2 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm had applied to our medical center. The aneurysm involved coeliac truncus and superior mesenteric artery and extended to the renal artery ostia. Multilayer flow modulator stent was successfully placed, and follow-up CT (Computed tomography) angiographic examination images recorded intermittently (36 months). Results After three years, it was observed that the left renal artery was thrombosed and the left kidney went to atrophy. Other major vascular branches were observed to be open. During this time, the aneurysm was completely closed with thrombus, but the diameter of the aneurysm continued to increase. Conclusions Multilayer flow modulator stents are safe in complex aortic aneurysms. The device increases the thrombus load in the aortic aneurysm and maintains the flow of the main vascular branches. But re-interventions, dilatation of the aneurysm sac and visceral branch obstructions are still challenging for multilayer flow modulator stents.

Methods We report the case of a 22-year-old female, healthy patient with pulmonary embolism (Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index Score 22 points, low risk) and extensive proximal deep vein thrombosis as a unique clinical manifestation of the new coronavirus disease. Results The patient had no risk factors and no familial history of venous thromboembolism. All thrombophilia markers were negative. The patient was treated as first by an independent vascular team, performing vena cava filter placement and open thrombectomy. Her symptoms worsened, and after 3 weeks, she underwent US-enhanced thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy. She was isolated for 10 days and did not develop any other clinical manifestation of COVID-19 disease. During follow-up, she remained asymptomatic and complete patency of the venous system was achieved. Full oral anticoagulation was conducted for 6 months. Conclusion COVID-19 appears to be a multi-symptomatic disease, and venous thromboembolism without any other previous described COVID-19 symptom could be considered one of its diverse clinical presentations and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 tests emerge to be mandatory in patients with otherwise unexpected venous thrombosis.

Provision of exercise services in patients with peripheral artery disease in the United Kingdom	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Peripheral artery disease; intermittent claudication; survey; best practice	INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION; SUPERVISED EXERCISE; PROGRAMS; THERAPY	Objectives Supervised exercise programmes (SEPs) are a vital treatment for people with intermittent claudication, leading improvements in walking distance and quality of life and are recommended in multiple national and international guidelines. We aimed to evaluate the use and structure of SEPs in the United Kingdom (UK). Design We conducted an anonymous online survey using the Jisc platform comprising of 40 questions. The survey was designed to address key areas such as access, provision, uptake and delivery of SEPs in the United Kingdom. Ethical approval was obtained from Coventry University (P108729). Methods The list of trusts providing vascular services was obtained from the National Vascular Registry (NVR) report. The survey was disseminated via social media, The Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland and the Society for Vascular Technology. Data were exported to a Microsoft Excel document and analysed using simple descriptive statistics. Results Of 93 vascular units identified, we received response from 48. Of these, 23 had access to an exercise programme (48%). The majority of SEPs were exclusively for PAD patients (77%), with 21% using integrated services. 67% of respondents were providing a circuit-based programme, and 5 out of 23 were meeting the dose recommendations in the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. Respondents felt that programmes were moderately to extremely important to patients, slightly to very important to clinicians and not at all important to slightly important to commissioning/funding bodies. Conclusion SEPs are a well-established first-line treatment for patients with IC and they are recommended by NICE guidelines. Despite this, many patients still do not have access to an exercise programme, and clinicians do not feel that they have support from commissioning/funding bodies to develop them. There is an urgent need for funding, development and delivery of SEPs in the United Kingdom.

Anaemia is also common amongst vascular surgical patients and has been linked with poor outcomes in some subgroups. We aimed to assess the frequency of anaemia in patients with ALI and its impact on survival and complications following revascularisation to help direct future efforts to optimise outcomes in this patient group. Methods A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected departmental data on patients undergoing surgical intervention for ALI between 2014 and 2018 was performed. Anaemia was defined as a pre-operative haemoglobin (Hb) of <120 g/L for women and <130 g/L for men. The primary outcome was overall survival, assessed with the Kaplan-Meier estimator, with application of Cox proportional hazard modelling to adjust for confounding covariates. Results There were 158 patients who underwent treatment for ALI: 89 (56.3%) of these were non-anaemic with a mean Hb of 146 (SD = 18.4), and 69 (43.7%) were anaemic with a mean Hb of 106 (SD = 13.4). Anaemic patients had a significantly higher risk of death than their non-anaemic counterparts on univariate analysis (HR = 2.11, 95% CIs, 1.28-3.5, p = 0.0036). There was ongoing divergence in survival up to around 6 months between anaemic and non-anaemic groups. Under the Cox model, anaemia was similarly significant as a predictor of death (HR = 2.15, 95% CIs, 1.17-3.95, p = 0.013), accounting for recorded comorbidities, medication use and blood transfusion. Conclusions Anaemia is a significant and independent risk factor for death following revascularisation for ALI and can be potentially be modified. Vascular surgical centres should ensure they have robust pathways in place to identify and consider treating anaemia.

Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on data obtained from the review of medical charts of all consecutive patients treated with CERAB technique for AIOD between January 2016 and December 2019 in San Giovanni-Addolorata Hospital (Rome, Italy). Clinical examination, duplex ultrasound with ankle-brachial index measurement and contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography were performed preoperatively. A clinical and ultrasound follow-up was carried out at one month and then half yearly after the intervention to evaluate patients' clinical status, limb salvage, target lesion revascularization rate, primary and secondary patency rate. Results During the study period, 24 patients (14 men, 58.3%; 10 women, 41.7%; median age 59 years, range 37-79 years) underwent CERAB for AIOD (TASC II C 29.2%, TASC II D 70.8%). Indications for treatment were: intermittent claudication in 18 patients (75%) and critical limb ischemia in 6 (25%). Technical success was achieved in all cases. Perioperative minor complications occurred in three cases (12.5%). One patient reported an intraoperative iliac rupture requiring adjunctive covered stenting. Median hospital length of stay was two days (range 1-9). No patient died perioperatively nor at the last follow-up. At a median follow-up of 18 months (range 6-48 months), mean ankle-brachial index increased significantly (from 0.62 +/- 0.15 before the procedure to 0.84 +/- 0.18) (P < 0.001) and target lesion revascularization rate was 12.5%. At two years, the limb salvage rate was 100%, and primary and secondary patency rates were 87.5% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion CERAB technique demonstrated to be effective at the mid-term follow-up with low rate of complications and short length of stay. Long-term results and more robust data are needed to affirm this technique as the first-line treatment for extensive AIOD. However, it could become the preferred option especially in fragile patients and during contemporary COVID-19 pandemic due to the current limitations in vascular and critical care bed capacity.

Whereas asymptomatic aneurysms are often managed conservatively, surgery has been used in symptomatic cases complicated by thrombosis or rupture. Surgical experience in management of portal aneurysms is restricted to case studies with limited comparative data and inconsistent reporting of outcomes. A hybrid open and endovascular approach has rarely been described in the literature. Methods We present a case of an extrahepatic portal aneurysm which demonstrated changes on surveillance imaging concerning for early asymptomatic thrombosis. Acute thrombus was identified at the time of open aneurysm repair. We review the limited literature regarding management of portal vein aneurysms in non-cirrhotic patients. Results Our case was complicated by intrahepatic thrombo-embolism, which necessitated hybrid thrombectomy and anticoagulant therapy. The patient remains asymptomatic at three-year follow-up with no recurrent aneurysm or thrombosis on surveillance Doppler and CT imaging. Conclusions Altered hemodynamic appearances on Doppler ultrasound and contrast-enhanced CT may warn of impending thrombosis in portal vein aneurysms. Hybrid open and endovascular surgical repair ensures vessel patency and a durable surgical result.

It is used to treat vascular graft infection; nevertheless, early graft infection has been reported. Report: A 71-year-old patient was treated with an Omniflow II bypass for a non-healing diabetic foot ulcer. Seven months postoperatively, late infection occurred secondary to hematogenous spread from a persistent foot infection. Conclusion We report on the first case of late infection of an Omniflow II vascular graft caused by hematogenous spread. Despite promising results of the Omniflow II graft in the treatment of vascular graft infection, late infection may not be avoided.

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the practices, finances, and social aspects of Brazilian vascular surgeons' lives. Methods This is a descriptive analysis of the responses from Brazilian vascular surgeons to the cross-sectional anonymous Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Task Force Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping, and Support Survey for Vascular Surgeons disseminated 14-24 April 2020. Survey dissemination in Brazil occurred mainly via the Brazilian Society of Angiology and Vascular Surgery (SBACV) and social media. The survey evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgeons' lives by assessing COVID-19-related stressors, anxiety using theGeneral Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 scale, and coping strategies using the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE) inventory. Results A total of 452 responses were recorded from Brazil, with 335 (74%) respondents completing the entire survey. The majority of respondents were males (N = 301, 67%) and practiced in an urban hospitals. The majority of respondents considered themselves at high risk to be infected with COVID-19 (N = 251, 55.8%), and just over half the respondents noted that they had adequate PPE at their primary hospital (N = 171, 54%). One hundred and nine (35%) surgeons confirmed that their hospitals followed professional surgical society guidelines for prioritizing surgeries during the pandemic. At the time of the survey, only 33 (10%) surgeons stated they have pre-operative testing of patients for COVID-19 available at their hospital. Academic vascular surgeons reported being redeployed more often to help with other non-vascular duties compared to community-based or solo practitioners (43% vs. 30% vs. 21% respectively,P = .01). Severe anxiety due to pandemic-related financial concerns was similar in those surgeons practicing solo compared to those in community- or academic-based/group practice (46% vs. 38% vs. 22%;P = .54). The respondents reported their anxiety levels as mild based on the stressors investigated instead of moderate-severe (54% vs. 46%;P = .04). Social media was utilized heavily during the pandemic, with video gatherings being the most commonly used tool (76%). Self-distraction (60%) and situational acceptance (81%) were the most frequently reported coping mechanisms used among Brazilian vascular surgeons.

We aimed to assess the safety and performance of the Dynamic stainless-steel balloon-expanding stent system in this location. Methods BIODYNAMIC is a retrospective single center study including consecutive patients with iliac lesions treated with the Dynamic stent system. Not included were implantations inside an endograft. The primary endpoint was freedom from major adverse limb events (MALE) at 12 months, defined as index limb amputation or target lesion revascularization (TLR). Secondary endpoints were procedure success, ankle brachial index (ABI) and Rutherford class change, mortality and freedom from TLR after 12 months. Results Within two years, 182 patients with 234 lesions in the common iliac artery were enrolled. Rutherford class 5 and 6 were present in 11.5% of patients, average stent diameter was 8.0 +/- 0.5 mm and stented length 40.0 +/- 15.3 mm. The primary endpoint was reached in 96.2% (225/234) of the cases, with six TLR (2.6%) and three target limb amputations (1.3%). Procedure success was obtained in all but three patients (98.4%). In paired analysis, ABI improved by 0.25 +/- 0.21 from baseline to 0.90 +/- 0.16 post-procedure and Rutherford class improved by -1.75 +/- 1.53. There were four non-device-related deaths (2.2%). Freedom from TLR was 97%, 95.3%, 94% and 92.7% at 24, 36, 48 and 60 months, respectively. Conclusion The Dynamic balloon-expandable stent system proved to be safe and effective in a population with common iliac artery lesions.

J	Saydam, O; Serefli, D				Saydam, Onur; Serefli, Deniz			Outcomes of rheolytic thrombectomy in phlegmasia cerulea dolens	VASCULAR			English	Article						Phlegmasia cerulea dolens; percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy; thrombolytic therapy	DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS; CATHETER-DIRECTED THROMBOLYSIS; CAERULEA DOLENS; GANGRENE; SAFETY	Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical features of phlegmasia cerulea dolens and present the treatment outcomes with rheolytic thrombectomy device. Methods From January 2014 and March 2019, 329 patients were diagnosed and hospitalized for acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis, and among those patients, seven patients diagnosed with lower extremity phlegmasia cerulea dolens were consecutively enrolled. Diagnosis of phlegmasia cerulea dolens was initially made on clinical findings followed by imaging with Doppler ultrasound. The rheolytic thrombectomy device was used in all patients with a combination of catheter-directed thrombolysis as an adjunctive therapy to facilitate more rapid thrombus clearance except for one patient who had a contraindication to the use of tissue plasminogen activator. Results Seven patients (four men, three women; median age, 63 years, range 52-68 years) were included. One patient had a relative contradiction to thrombolysis due to history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery; all other patients underwent pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy with power pulse mode. The upper limit of 480 s was completed in all patients, and this time was not exceeded to prevent hemolysis-related complications. Six Fr catheters were used in four (57.1%) patients, and 8 Fr catheters were used in three patients (42.9%). Mean thrombolytic infusion duration was 28 +/- 6.2 h for patients who received tissue plasminogen activator. After catheter-directed thrombolysis, total radiological success was achieved in two patients, and partial radiologic success was achieved in five patients; however, in all seven patients, clinical success was achieved. The mean duration for complete regression of cyanosis was 18.9 +/- 8.1 h. Although no patients required blood replacement, mean decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit were 2.7 +/- 1.37 g/dl and 6.42 +/- 4.47%, respectively. Acute kidney injury developed in three patients (42.9%). One patient required continuous renal replacement therapy. No cardiac complication was observed. One (14.3%) patient died of ventilator-related pneumonia on postprocedural day 10. The median duration of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay were 72 h (min-max: 24-264 h) and six days (min-max: 5-33 days), respectively. Conclusion Rheolytic thrombectomy was less invasive and effective strategy for early stage phlegmasia cerulea dolens at creating rapid thrombus clearance to establish clinical success and facilitate more conservative management with catheter-directed thrombolysis.

However, given the limitation of the current technologies,PIK3CAsomatic mutations are detected only in a limited proportion of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome cases and tissue biopsy remains an invasive high risky, sometimes life-threatening, diagnostic procedure. Next generation sequencing liquid biopsy using cell-free DNA has emerged as an innovative non-invasive approach for early detection and monitoring of cancer. This approach, overcoming the space-time profile constraint of tissue biopsies, opens a new scenario also for others diseases caused by somatic mutations. Methods In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of seven patients (four females and three males) with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Blood samples from both peripheral and efferent vein from malformation were collected and cell-free DNA was extracted from plasma. Tissue biopsies from vascular lesions were also collected when available. Cell-free DNA libraries were performed using Oncomine (TM) Pan-Cancer Cell-Free Assay. Ion Proton for sequencing and Ion Reporter Software for analysis were used (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Results Cell-free circulating DNA analysis revealed pathogenic mutations inPIK3CAgene in all patients. The mutational load was higher in plasma obtained from the efferent vein at lesional site (0.81%) than in the peripheral vein (0.64%) leading to conclude for a causative role of the identified variants. Tissue analysis, available for one amputated patient, confirmed the presence of the mutation at the malformation site at a high molecular frequency (14-25%), confirming its causative role. Conclusions Our data prove for the first time that the cell-free DNA-next generation sequencing-liquid biopsy, which is currently used exclusively in an oncologic setting, is indeed the most effective tool for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome diagnosis and tailored personalized treatment.

Methods We evaluated 104 patients with the diagnosis of acute deep vein thrombosis. The pain complaints of the patients at the time of admission and the pain complaints in the calf with dorsiflexion of the foot were evaluated with the visual analogue pain scale, and the calf diameter of affected limbs was measured. Fifty five patients had dextran 40 infusion and unfractionated heparin treatment concomitantly (Group HD), while 49 patients had unfractionated heparin treatment (Group H). Heparin dose was adjusted to obtain 1.5- to 2.5-fold of normal activated partial thromboplastin time in both groups. Oral anticoagulant, warfarin sodium, was administered in the first day and resumed. Unfractionated heparin infusion therapy was resumed until international normalized ratio values of 2-2.5 were obtained. Dextran 40 infusion therapy was administered for 3 days. Calf diameters, current pain, and calf pain at foot dorsiflexion were recorded at 48 h and 72 h. 65 patients were distal, and 39 patients were proximal and popliteal acute DVT. None of the patients had phlegmasia. All were acute DVT. Results At 48 and 72 h of therapy, it was determined that the decrease of the calf diameter and the pain were more significant both at 48th and 72nd hours in the Group HD. The calf circumference change, especially at 72 h, was 2.58 +/- 0.39 cm in the group receiving heparin + dextran, while it was 1.76 +/- 0.56 cm in the group receiving only heparin. (p = 0.000). While there were only 1.24 +/- 1.02 people in the group that received dextran at 72 h, leg pain persisted in 3.35 +/- 1.11 people in the other group. (p = 0.000). Evaluation was made only with calf vein diameter measurement. When patients with Homan's sign were evaluated for their calf pain at foot dorsiflexion; both groups had decreased pain at 48th and 72nd hours. Conclusion In this study, we observed that the use of dextran 40 infusion therapy concomitantly with unfractionated heparin accelerates recovery substantially and decreases patient complaints significantly in early stages. In particular, reduction in leg pain and calf circumference reduction were more adequate in the dextran group. The early decrease in the calf circumference will have clinical consequences such as less heparin intake, earlier return to normal life, and a decrease in the total cost of treatment. Since the antithrombotic and anticoagulant effects of dextran are well known, we think that its use in this treatment as well as venous thromboembolism prophylaxis should be discussed.

This study compares the development of pulmonary embolism, post-thrombotic syndrome, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Methods One hundred and eight patients diagnosed with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) between June 2020 and February 2021 in our institution were included in this retrospective study. Thirty-nine patients had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 and specified as the COVID-19 group. Sixty-nine patients did not have COVID-19 and specified as the non-COVID-19 group. Mean ages of both groups were 64.3 +/- 15.8 and 60.1 +/- 19.7 years, respectively (p = .37). Results The median duration from the onset of the COVID-19 to diagnosis of DVT was 22 (2-120) days in the COVID-19 group. The patients of two groups were mostly treated outpatient at rates of 94.9% vs 94.2%, respectively (p = .88). Pulmonary embolism was seen in six patients (15.4%) in the COVID-19 group and in three patients (4.3%) in the non-COVID-19 group (p = .04). Kaplan-Meir curves showed that patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher pulmonary embolism than those without COVID-19 (p = .015). The recurrence rate of DVT was 2.6% in the COVID-19 group (n = 1), and 4.3% in the non-COVID-19 group (n = 3), indicating no statistically significant difference (p = .63). Mortality was seen in six patients (15.4%) in the COVID-19 group, and in seven patients (10.1%) in the non-COVID-19 group. According to the Kaplan-Meir method, 10 months survival rates were 73.9 +/- 10% in the COVID-19 group, and 66.3 +/- 12.8% in the non-COVID-19 group with no statistical significance (p = .218). Conclusions Our data draw attention to the fact that deep vein thrombosis should not be considered a safe and self-limited condition. Efficient preventive measures such as mobilization and prophylactic drug use should be considered to prevent DVT during the management of COVID-19.

A case series	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Profunda femoris artery; anastomotic femoral aneurysm; femoral pseudoaneurysm	SURGERY	Objective This study aims to report a case series of anastomotic femoral pseudoaneurysms (PSA) treated with stent-grafting (SG) in patients at high-risk for the open surgical approach. Methods It is a retrospective, observational cohort study. Between 1 January 2002 and 1 April 2020, post-hoc analysis of the database including patients who received repair for femoral PSA identified those treated with SG. All but one patient were approached through a contralateral percutaneous transfemoral access, and the SG was always deployed from the common femoral artery to the profunda femoris artery. For this study, primary outcomes of interest were early (<= 30 days) survival and patency rate. Results We identified 10/823 cases of the entire PSA cohort (1.2%). There were 9 men and 1 woman: the mean age was 76 years +/- 9 (range: 64-92). Urgent intervention was performed in 4 patients. The median operative time was 30 min (IQR: 25-36). Access-related complication was never observed. In-hospital mortality occurred in 1 patient due to novel coronavirus-19-related pneumonia. Median follow-up was 24 months (IQR: 12-37); 5 patients died. At the last radiologic follow-up available, all SGs were patent without necessity of reintervention. Conclusion Stent-graft repair for anastomotic femoral PSA may be considered a reasonable alternative for patients at high-risk for open surgical repair.

James			The impact of pre-existing blood pressure control in patients with acute aortic dissections	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Hypertension; pre-existing; acute aortic dissection	INTERNATIONAL REGISTRY; INSIGHTS; HYPERTENSION; SOCIETY	Objectives Arterial hypertension (HTN) is considered a seminal risk factor for aortic dissection (AD). The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether pre-existing blood pressure (BP) control lessens the extent of dissection and has a favorable impact on outcome of patients with acute AD. Methods Consecutive acute AD patients who had at least two BPs recorded within the 12 months preceding the AD were retrospectively analyzed. The two most recent BPs were averaged and defined per published guidelines as normal (BP <= 130/80), Stage I HTN (BP >130/80 and <139/89), or Stage 2 or greater HTN (BP > 140/90). The number of hypertensive medications (MEDs) was also used as a surrogate marker of HTN severity. Patients with known genetic causes of AD were excluded. Results 89 subjects (55% men, 45% women; mean age, 64 +/- 14 years) with acute AD (58% Stanford type A and 42% Stanford type B) were included. Two most recent BPs were recorded a mean of 5 +/- 3 and 3 +/- 2.7 months before the AD, respectively. Twenty-nine (33%) subjects had normal BP, including nine subjects with no history of HTN and on no MEDs. Sixty (67%) subjects had elevated BP, including 21 (35%) with Stage I HTN and 39 (65%) with Stage 2 HTN. Compared to subjects with normal BP, subjects with Stage 1 and Stage 2 HTN were younger (70 +/- 13 years vs 62 +/- 1 year, p = 0.01), but there were no differences in other demographics, risk factors, comorbidities, or history of drug use. There were no group differences in the distal extent of the dissections, complications requiring thoracic endograft repair, mean length of hospital stay, final discharge status, or 30-day mortality. Compared to the number of MEDs before AD, all three groups had a higher mean number of MEDs to achieve normal BP at discharge that persisted at a mean follow-up of 18 +/- 15 months. Conclusions These data show that approximately one-third of patients with acute AD had well controlled or no antecedent history of HTN. The degree of pre-existing HTN control had no bearing on the type or extent of AD, length of stay, or early outcome. Regardless of the state of HTN control before AD, the consistent and sustained increase in the severity of HTN after AD suggests that the dissection process has a profound and lasting effect on BP regulation. Further studies are indicated to elucidate the pathologic mechanisms involved in AD.	[Reed, Amy B.; Faizer, Rumi; Valentine, R.

Methods A comprehensive search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase was conducted to identify articles in English, related to preventive collateral arteries embolization before EVAR, published until October 2020. Results A total of 12 relevant studies, including 11 retrospective studies and one randomized controlled trial, were identified and fulfilled the specified inclusion criteria. A total of 1706 patients in 11 studies were involved in the meta-analysis. The overall incidence of T2EL was 17.3% in the embolization group vs. 34.5% in the control group (OR 0.36, p < 0.01). The incidence of persistent T2EL was 15.3% vs. 30.0% (OR 0.37, p < 0.01). Five studies reported the incidence of sac enlargement, with the rate 10.2% vs. 24.9% (OR 0.25, p < 0.01). Nine studies reported T2EL related re-interventions, and it was 1.3% in the embolization group and 10.4% in control (OR 0.14, p < 0.01). The technical success of collateral arteries embolization was 92.1% (455/494) in the 12 studies. 1.2% (10/829) patients suffered a mild complication of collateral arteries embolization, and 2/829 patients died because of the embolization. Conclusion Collateral arteries embolization is a promising measure to prevent the occurrence of T2EL, sac enlargement, and re-intervention. High-quality studies need to be conducted to provide stronger evidence-based medical suggestions about the embolize operation.

However, at present, the characteristics and etiology still remain unclear. Our study was designed to describe the clinical features of carotid body tumors in our institution and to compare the results with previous reports. Methods We retrospectively reviewed carotid body tumor patients diagnosed in our institution from January 2015 to May 2020. The demographics, comorbidities, lesion location, anatomic characteristics, complications, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. Carotid body tumor measurements were determined from computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and carotid arteriography examination. We described and compared the clinical features of carotid body tumors in our institution and other reports. Results We totally identified 122 carotid body tumor cases for the present analysis. The mean age was 50.26 years, with the majority being female (82%). The commonest presentation was a painless neck mass (68%). For the distribution of nationality, most patients were the Han nationality (69.7%). The mean altitude of habitat of patients was 2689.4 km; 19.7% patients suffered bilateral lesions. The main blood supply of carotid body tumors was from external carotid artery (54.1%). For patients who received operation, 11 (11.2%) patients experienced cranial nerve injury. The maximal diameter of tumors was 3.99 +/- 1.98 cm in male and 3.38 +/- 1.36 cm in female. The volume of tumors was 31.49 +/- 29.76 cm(3) in male and 15.27 +/- 13.06 cm(3) in female. The distance to base of skull of tumors was 3.39 +/- 1.07 cm (3.99 +/- 1.98 cm in male vs 3.38 +/- 1.36 cm, P < 0.05). Two patients (2.04%) were identified as having malignant carotid body tumor. Conclusions Though carotid body tumor had a low morbidity and multitudinous clinicopathologic features, it was apt to middle-aged women and the main blood supply was from external carotid artery. The painless neck mass was the commonest presentation of carotid body tumors. There were significant difference between male and female patients regarding platelet, hemoglobin, distance to base of skull, tumor volume, altitude of habitat, carotid body tumor location, and hypertension.

J	Guo, YY; Zhu, F; Zhang, X; Wu, GM; Fu, PT; Yang, J				Guo, Yuanyuan; Zhu, Fan; Zhang, Xiong; Wu, Guangmin; Fu, Pinting; Yang, Jun			Extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibition prevents venous adaptive remodeling via regulation of Eph-B4	VASCULAR			English	Article						Vein graft stenosis; vein graft adaptation; ERK1; 2; EphB4; VSMCs; transgenic rats		Objectives Vein graft adaptation (VGA) is a process that vein as a vascular graft conduits in arterial reconstructive surgery; VGA can lead to postoperative vein graft stenosis (VGS) and complications after coronary artery bypass graft and other peripheral artery bypass surgeries. VGA is characterized by vein graft loss the venous features without exhibiting arterial features; furthermore, the activation of ERK inhibited the maintenance of venous properties of the vein graft. We hypothesized that ERK inhibition can affect vein VGS through regulating the expression of EphB4. Methods Rat vein transplantation model was established using wild-type and EphB4(+/-) Sprague-Dawley rats. Hematoxylin-eosin, Masson, Verhoeff, actin staining, and immunohistochemistry were applied to observe the structure of the vein grafts. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were isolated from the vein and vein grafts. Western blotting was used to determine the expression of p-ERK1/2 and EphB4, and immunofluorescence was applied to detect the expression and location of EphB4. Cell wound scratch assay and CCK8 assay were used to determine the migration and proliferation of VSMCs. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the mRNA expression of EphB4. Results Western blotting in vein sample and vein graft sample detected p-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 expression in both EphB4(+/+) and EphB4(+/-) rats. The expression of p-ERK was increased in vein graft compared to vein. Immunofluorescence in VSMCs form EphB4(+/+) and EphB4(+/-) rats detected EphB4 expression in both cells, and the expression of EphB4 was increased in VSMCs form EphB4(+/+) rats. SCH772984 reduces the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. Inhibition of ERK suppressed the increase of vein graft wall thickness, and the expression of collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and alpha-actin was decreased. Vein graft from EphB4(+/-) rats reduces the expression of EphB4, and SCH772984 suppressed the decrease of EphB4 in vivo. Vein graft from EphB4(+/-) rats increased the expression of EphB4, and SCH772984 suppressed the increase of EphB4 in vivo. Conclusions The inhibition of ERK1/2 suppressed the process of VGS by decreasing the proliferation of VSMCs. The ERK-inhibitor SCH772984 suppressed the level of VGS by extending the time of EphB4 expression during the process of VGA, thus maintaining the venousization of vein graft. The mechanism may be that the inhibitor SCH772984 suppresses the level of VGS by extending the time of EphB4 expression during the process of VGA. Therefore, our research provides a new target of VGS treatment by inhibiting the expression of ERK1/2 through the process of VGA.

The objective of this study is to introduce how a group of vascular surgery residencies joined forces to improve surgical education in times of COVID-19. Methods On May 2020, a group of Hispanic American vascular residency programs created webinar sessions of arterial and venous clinical cases among vascular residents across Latin America and Europe. Participants were surveyed via email. Questions were about the perceived quality and utility of the webinars; answers were stratified into negative (disagree), neutral, and positive (agree). Results There have been 60 sessions and 118 clinical cases presented. The survey was answered by 106 participants, 82 males (78.8%) and 24 women (23.0%). Fifty-four (51.9%) were board-certified vascular surgeons, 49 (47.1%) vascular surgery residents, and 2 (1.9%) general surgery residents. Mean age of the participants was 41.5 years (range: 25-74 years). Mean years of vascular surgery practice or experience were 11.2 years (range: 0-45 years). The residency programs involved in this project were from 13 different countries. Most answers received were positive for both perceived quality and utility of the webinars. Conclusion Globalization and technology provide an opportunity for international education, with the goal of building well-rounded and academic vascular surgeons. This group is just the beginning of a large collaborative group among Hispanic American countries, hoping that more residency programs will join, with the aim of breaking borders in the education of vascular surgery.

Methods The patient suffered from chronic type B aortic dissection coexisting with a large false lumen and an intimal tear. He underwent TEVAR with left common carotid-left subclavian artery bypass. Results The following day, the patient exhibited a bleeding tendency and marked subcutaneous hemorrhage. He had a low fibrinogen level, a low platelet count, and high levels of fibrin dimer product and D-dimer. We diagnosed the condition as disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and administered recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM). The patient recovered successfully from disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and was discharged on postoperative day 6. Conclusions We successfully treated a patient with chronic type B aortic dissection with a large intimal tear complicated by postoperative disseminated intravascular coagulopathy using TEVAR followed by rhTM administration. rhTM may be considered in patients with large intimal tear and false lumen.

Characteristics and outcomes of patients with peripheral artery disease undergoing endovascular revascularization: A community hospital perspective	VASCULAR			English	Article						Multidisciplinary; outcomes; peripheral artery disease	AMPUTATION-FREE SURVIVAL; SMOKING-CESSATION; INTERVENTIONS; PREVENTION; CORONARY; ASPIRIN; EVENTS; VOLUME	Background There are limited data on outcomes for patients with peripheral artery disease undergoing endovascular revascularization by multi-disciplinary teams in a community hospital setting. Methods From January 2015 through December 2015, we assembled a multi-disciplinary program comprised of cardiologists, surgeons, radiologists, nurses, and administrative staff for managing patients with peripheral artery disease undergoing endovascular revascularization. Demographic, procedural, and outcomes data were collected with use of a template from the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative database. We compared characteristics and outcomes of patients with intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate the rate of overall survival and freedom from rehospitalization between groups. Results After excluding patients with acute limb ischemia (n = 5), peripheral intervention to the upper extremity (n = 6), or abdominal aorta (n = 11), there were 82 patients in the study cohort; 45 had intermittent claudication and 37 had critical limb ischemia. Baseline and procedural characteristics were similar between groups, although critical limb ischemia patients were more likely to have hyperlipidemia (75.7% vs. 53.3%,P = .42). Procedural success was achieved in 91.3% of cases. Actionable access site bleeding occurred in 2.4% of patients. High rates of aspirin (91.5%) and statin (87.8%) were noted at discharge. After two years of post endovascular revascularization, survival was 57.5% for critical limb ischemia patients and 94.4% for intermittent claudication patients (P < .001). Freedom from rehospitalization was 32.7% for critical limb ischemia patients and 83.5% for intermittent claudication patients (P < .001). Conclusions We found that favorable outcomes may be achieved with a multi-disciplinary peripheral artery disease program at community hospitals. The incorporation of quality improvement practices may further help to develop standardized and regionalized approaches to care delivery for patients with peripheral artery disease.

Methods In this retrospective study, 51 consecutive patients with symptomatic ISMAD received endovascular management from three institutions between January 2011 and December 2019.These patients were categorized into group A (endovascular treatment was used as the first-line therapy) and group B(endovascular treatment was used as the second-line therapy). The general epidemiological data, clinical manifestations, first-episode symptoms, treatment process, imaging findings, follow-up outcomes were analyzed from the medical records. Results A total of 51 patients with endovascular management were collected in this study. Significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to the course (150 h vs. 57 h;p < 0.001), intestinal ischemia (26.32% vs. 6,25%;p = 0.04) and dissection length (45.26 +/- 13.78 mm vs. 63.37 +/- 12.73 mm;p < 0.001). Technical success rate was 90.2% (46/51). There was significant difference in the MOD (42.27 +/- 23.41 min vs. 76.63 +/- 28.62 minp < 0.001), MPSRT (4.67 +/- 2.65 h vs. 7.32 +/- 2.49 h,p = 0.02), LOS (9.52 +/- 3.72 days vs. 11.86 +/- 4.13 days;p = 0.01) between the two groups. The bleeding complication rate was 7.84% (one patient in group A and three patients in group B). A total of 48 (94.12%, 48/51) patients were followed up for a median of 36.51 months (range, 4-87 months). Positive events of the SMA were achieved in 81.25% (39/48), and negative events of the SMA were achieved in 18.75% (8/48) based on the follow-up contrast-enhanced CT scan. Conclusions Endovascular management of symptomatic ISMAD has a high technical success rate and efficient at controlling symptoms. Furthermore, as more positive events occur, endovascular management should be encouraged early when pain persists after conservative management or there are signs of disease progression.

This study examines the impact of endograft type on perioperative outcomes for ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. Method The targeted endovascular aneurysm repair files of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2012-2017) were used. Only patients treated for ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm were included. All patients requiring concomitant stenting of the visceral arteries or aneurysmal iliac arteries or open abdominal surgery were excluded. The characteristics of patients treated with the different endografts and the corresponding outcomes were compared using Stata software. Results There were 479 patients treated with the three most common endografts: Cook Zenith (n = 127), Gore Excluder (n = 239), and Medtronic Endurant (n = 113). The number of other endografts was too small for statistical analysis. Compared to patients treated with Excluder or Endurant, the patients treated with Zenith had significantly lower body mass index (P < .001) and were less likely to be white (P < .001). On the other hand, patients treated with Endurant were less likely to be smoker (P = .016). Patients treated with Zenith had significantly larger ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter (P = .045). The overall mortality was 18% and morbidity 74.3%. There was a statistically significant difference in overall mortality (Zenith = 11.8%, Excluder = 18%, Endurant = 24.8%,P = .033) but not morbidity (P = .808) between the three groups. Post hoc analysis for overall mortality showed only significant difference between Zenith and Endurant. The difference in mortality was not significant in patients presenting with ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm without hypotension (P = .065). On multivariable analysis, treatment with the Endurant endograft was associated with increased mortality compared to Zenith (odds ratio = 3.0 [confidence interval 1.31-6.7]). General anesthesia (odds ratio = 2.67 [confidence interval 1.02-7.02]), rupture with hypotension (odds ratio = 4.49 [confidence interval 2.54-7.95]), and dependent functional status (odds ratio = 5.7 [confidence interval 1.96-16.59]) were independently associated with increased mortality while increasing body mass index (odds ratio = 0.97 [confidence interval 0.95-0.99]) was associated with reduced risk of mortality. Conclusions This study highlights contemporary outcomes of endovascular aneurysm repair for ruptured infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with relatively low mortality. Endograft type and anesthesia technique are modifiable factors that can potentially improve outcomes. Significant variation in the outcomes of the different endografts warrants further research.

This study aimed to determine whether different kinds of perioperative antihypertensive drugs had a protective effect on post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension and influence on intraoperative hemodynamics. Method: We retrospectively investigated 102 carotid stenosis patients who underwent conventional endarterectomy with a perioperative baseline antihypertensive regimen. Post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension was defined as a postoperative peak systolic blood pressure >= 160 mmHg and/or a requirement for any additional antihypertensive therapies. We compared the clinical characteristics and types of baseline perioperative antihypertensive drugs between patients with and without post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension and then determined the significant independent effect of antihypertensive drugs on post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension through multivariate regression and detected their influence on intraoperative hypertension (induction-related systolic blood pressure and vasodilators consumption) and hemodynamic depression (intra-arterial systolic blood pressure <= 100 mmHg and/or heart rate <= 50 beats/min). We also investigated adverse events such as stroke, death, myocardial infarction, and cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome during the postoperative hospitalization. Results: A total of 52/102 (51.0%) patients were defined as having post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension during the first three days postoperative, including eight patients with a postoperative systolic blood pressure that exceeded 160 mmHg at least once, 31 patients requiring postoperative antihypertensive treatment in addition to their baseline regimen, and 13 patients with both. The incidence of stroke/death/myocardial infarction and cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome after conventional endarterectomy during hospitalization were both 1.9%. A significantly increased risk of composite postoperative complications (including cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, hyperperfusion-related symptoms, transient ischemic attacks, stroke, death, and cardiac complications) was observed in patients with post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension than without (15.4% versus 2.0%,p = 0.032). Patients free of post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension had a higher incidence of perioperative baseline beta-blocker use than patients who suffered from post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension (46.0% versus 21%,p = 0.008). In multivariate analysis, beta-blocker use was a significant independent protective factor for post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension (OR = 0.356, 95% CI: 0.146-0.886,p = 0.028). Patients taking beta-blockers had a lower postoperative peak systolic blood pressure than the beta-blocker-naive population (137.1 +/- 12.1 mmHg versus 145.0 +/- 11.2 mmHg,p = 0.008), but the postoperative mean systolic blood pressure showed no intergroup difference. However, the incidence of hemodynamic depression during conventional endarterectomy was higher in patients with perioperative beta-blocker use than in those without (44.1% versus 25.0%,p = 0.050). The difference in intraoperative hemodynamic depression became more prominent between the beta-blocker and non-beta-blocker groups (81.8% versus 33.3%,p = 0.014) for whose preoperative baseline heart rate was equal to or lower than 70 beats/min. Conclusion: The perioperative use of beta-blockers is a protective factor for post-carotid endarterectomy hypertension and contributes to stabilizing the postoperative peak systolic blood pressure three days after conventional endarterectomy. However, beta-blockers might also lead to intraoperative hemodynamic depression, especially for patients with a low baseline heart rate.

We studied PAD prevalence, risk factors, and six-month outcomes in stable outpatients with a history of a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or at high coronary risk. Methods We recruited 830 outpatients in 43 Mexican sites (median age: 64.8 years; 57.8% men). Inclusion criteria were age >18 years, and ACS within 30 days, or age <55 years plus >= 2 major vascular risk factors, or age >= 55 years plus >= 1 vascular risk factors. Patients received standardized assessments at baseline and six-month follow-up for medical history, ankle-brachial index (ABI), and the Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire (ECQ). Results ABI <0.8 was found in 10.5%, <0.9 in 22.5%, >1.3 in 4.8%, and >1.4 in 3.6%, without differences according to sex or selection criteria. Positive ECQ was found in 7.6%. ABI <0.9 was directly associated with age, diabetes, ACS, and chronic kidney disease, but inversely associated with BMI >27. The six-month case-fatality and atherothrombotic events rates were 1.6% and 3.6%, respectively. In patients with ABI <0.9 and ABI <0.8, the six-month case-fatality rates were 2.5% (p = 0.27) and 5.4% (p = 0.03), respectively. In a Cox proportional-hazards model, baseline factors associated with death were age >= 65, ABI <0.8, and ACS. Conclusions Subclinical PAD is more common than symptomatic claudication in high-risk coronary outpatients. Low ABI is associated with reduced short-term survival in patients with recent ACS or at high coronary risk.

J	Li, H; Yang, M				Li, Hui; Yang, Min			Ligustrazine activate the PPAR-gamma pathway and play a protective role in vascular calcification	VASCULAR			English	Article; Early Access						Ligustrazine tetramethylpyrazine; vascular calcification; osteogenesis; PPAR-gamma pathway	HEMODIALYSIS; PROGRESSION; KIDNEY	Objective The purpose of this study was to explore the role of ligustrazine in vascular calcification. Methods After beta-GP stimulation, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were detected by Alizarin Red Staing staining. Calcium content and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were detected by intracellular calcium assay kit and ALP assay kit, respectively. The expression of peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma) pathway-related proteins was detected by Western blot. PPAR-gamma, MSX2, osteopontin (OPN), sclerostin, and BGP were detected by RT-PCR. Results beta-GP induced the decreased activity and expression of PPAR-gamma and ALP in VSMCs, while ligustrazine activated the expression of PPAR-gamma. Through activation of PPAR-gamma, ligustrazine decreased beta-GP-induced VSMC calcification, decreased the expression of markers of osteogenesis and chondrogenic differentiation, and increased the expression of VSMC markers. Conclusion Ligustrazine activates the PPAR-gamma pathway and plays a protective role in vascular calcification.

Method Consecutive patients with severely diseased superficial femoral and popliteal arteries who received SUPERA (R) stents were retrospectively identified. The patients were followed for 12 months by Doppler ultrasound examinations, stent roentgenograms, and estimation of Rutherford-Becker class and ankle-brachial index. Results From July 2012 to May 2014, 42 limbs in 36 patients (mean age, 61.5 +/- 7.5 years; 75% male) were treated with angioplasty and primary stenting. Total occlusions were present in 14 limbs, and 63.8% had either moderate or severe calcification. The mean (+/- SD) lesion length was 105 mm (+/- 28). Primary patency was 91.4% at 6 months and 85.7% at 12 months. The ankle brachial index increased from 0.57 +/- 0.19 preoperative to 0.91 +/- 0.12 postoperative. There was no procedural or device-related morbidity or mortality after revascularization and only one major amputation was observed on follow-up. Conclusions Our experience shows that, Supera stents are safe and effective in our cohort of patients, with acceptable patency rates. There were no stent fractures so far even with stenting of the femoropopliteal segments. Stent design provides a viable option for high-grade obstructive disease in the femoropopliteal artery.

However, even fewer studies focus on vascular malformations specific to the head and neck, which confer an increased specific risk of airway compromise, neurologic and ophthalmologic injury. More understanding is required surrounding the type and incidence of complications to improve treatment planning and informed consent. Therefore, this study aimed to review major complications secondary to EST of head and neck vascular malformations over a 5-year period in a single specialized multidisciplinary centre for vascular anomalies. Methods All interventions were decided by the multidisciplinary team. Demographic, procedural and complication data between 1st January 2013 and 31st December 2017 were prospectively documented in a dedicated database and analysed. EST of high-flow vascular malformations (HFVMs) was performed by selective catheter angiography or direct injection, and by direct injection only for low-flow vascular malformations (LFVMs). Major complications were defined as any tissue or functional damage caused by direct injection, distal embolization or tissue reaction and were decided by the multidisciplinary team. Results Forty-eight patients (median age of 35 years; range of 14-70 years; 18 men and 30 women) had 100 EST procedures for head and neck vascular malformation. Of these, 14 patients had EST for HFVM and 34 patients for LFVM, total 43 and 57 procedures, respectively. Overall, five patients with HFVM developed major complications from EST when compared with two patients with LFVM (p = 0.0167). Two patients required pre-emptive tracheostomy due to risk of post-operative airway compromise. Overall, seven (14.6%) patients experienced major complication from EST. In the HFVM group, major complications from EST occurred in five patients; four cases of tissue ulceration and necrosis (two needed debridement, one healed with resultant fibrosis that impeded speech and one resolved spontaneously) and one post-procedural airway compromise requiring tracheostomy. Meanwhile, in the LFVM group, major complications occurred in two patients; one case of severe necrosis involving the alar cartilage, lip and cheek requiring debridement and reconstruction under plastics and one simple cellulitis. No patients sustained stroke or vision impairment. Conclusions EST is relatively safe for head and neck vascular malformations in a high-volume experienced centre. Our major complication rate of 14.6% per patient (35.7% for HFVM; 5.9% for LFVM) or 7% per procedure (11.6% for HFVM; 3.5% LFVM) compares favourably with published data from other centres. These data will improve treatment planning and informed consent for EST for both HFVM and LFVM of the head and neck.

Methods Using Medicare data, we identified opioid-naive patients undergoing vascular procedures between 2009 and 2017. We selected patients >= 65 years old with continuous enrollment 12 months before and 6 months after surgery and had no additional operations. We defined new persistent opioid use (NPOU) as one or more opioid prescription fills both between 4-90 and 91-180 days postoperatively. Multivariable regression was performed for risk adjustment, and frequencies of NPOU were estimated between endovascular and open techniques to compare surgical approach. Results A total of 77,767 patients were identified, with 2.6% of all patients developing new persistent use. In addition to the identification of several risk factors for new persistent use, patients undergoing endovascular carotid or vertebral interventions were found to have higher adjusted frequencies of persistent use compared to those undergoing open interventions (3.0% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001) as did those undergoing endovenous compared to open vein procedures (2.2%, vs. 1.6%, p = 0.019). We found no difference for peripheral vascular or aortic/iliac procedures. Conclusions Patients undergoing vascular surgery are at high risk for new persistent use. Undergoing endovascular carotid or venous surgery was associated with an increased risk of NPOU, whereas no differences were found between endovascular and open approaches for peripheral arterial or aortic disease.

The expression alternation of circular RNAs (circRNAs) has been found in various diseases. However, the function of circRNAs in deep vein thrombosis still remains unknown. Method The blood samples of deep vein thrombosis patients and health control were selected, circRNA microarray was performed, and qPCR was used to verify the expression of circRNAs. Also, GO/KEGG analysis was performed, and hsa_circ_RNA_000455-targeted miRNA-mRNA network was predicted. Result Here, we found that 303 circRNAs were differentially expressed in deep vein thrombosis using microarray, of which 83 circRNAs were upregulated and 220 circRNAs were downregulated. The expression of five circRNAs verified by quantitative real-time PCR was consistent with the result of microarray. GO analysis showed that the top 100 differentially expressed circRNAs in deep vein thrombosis patients were closely related to protein transport, cytoplasm, and Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) binding. The most significantly enriched pathways by KEGG analysis included thyroid hormone-signaling pathway, endocytosis, proteoglycans in cancer, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, focal adhesion, insulin-signaling pathway, p53-signaling pathway, biosynthesis of antibiotics, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, and AMP-activated protein kinase-signaling pathway. Then, hsa_circ_000455 was selected, and the function of hsa_circ_000455 in the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis was analyzed via circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. We therefore hypothesized that hsa_circRNA_000455/hsa-miR-22-3p/NLRP3 may involve in the development of deep vein thrombosis.

External jugular vein aneurysms (EJVA) are considered innocent lesions that need treatment mainly for aesthetic reasons. The aim of this systematic review was to present current literature regarding diagnosis and management of EJVAs. Methods A literature review was conducted through the Pubmed/Medline and Scopus regarding articles referring on EJVA from 2000 to 2020. Using the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses), 30 articles were identified, according to inclusion criteria. Demographics, clinical characteristics, etiology, diagnostic imaging, complications, treatment, and histopathological findings were recorded and analyzed. Results Twenty-seven case reports and one case series were identified, including 30 patients and 31 EJVAs. One-third of patients (30.3%) were < 18 years old (mean age 32 years, range 1-72 years) and 54% of them were females. In 51% of the cases, the lesion was characterized as a true aneurysm after histological evaluation. The presence of a soft cervical mass was the most common clinical symptom, while Valsalva maneuver pointed out the presence of an EJVA in 66.7% of patients. Diagnosis was achieved using ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. Forty-three percent of the patients underwent more than one radiological examination. Twenty patients underwent surgical management. The primary indication of surgical treatment was aesthetic reasons (11/20, 55%). Thrombosis was the most common EJVA complication (11/30, 36.3%). Conclusions Differential diagnosis of neck mass should include EJVA. High clinical suspicion and adequate imaging are important for diagnosis. Open surgical approach is the more commonly applied therapeutic strategy.

Therefore, in this meta-analysis, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of USACDT with conventional catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients with deep vein thrombosis. Methods A systematic search of the following electronic databases was performed from their dates of inception to 20 June 2020: MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE. All randomized controlled trials that directly compared the complications and efficacy of USACDT and conventional catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients with deep vein thrombosis were identified. The statistical analysis was performed using comprehensive meta-analysis software. Results Finally, 18 studies with a total of 597 participants were included in our meta-analysis according to the eligibility criteria. Pooled proportion of USACDT success in patients with deep vein thrombosis was 87.8% (18 studies; 95% CI: 83.1-91.3). Success rate was significantly higher in USACDT treatment than in conventional catheter-directed thrombolysis treatment (seven studies; OR: 2.96; 95% CI: 1.69-5.16; P < 0.01)). Although the mean infusion time was higher in catheter-directed thrombolysis treatment compared to USACDT treatment, this difference was not statistically significant (three studies; MD: -1.46; 95% CI: -3.25-0.32; P = 0.10). Moreover, pooled rate of complications was lower in USACDT than catheter-directed thrombolysis which was not statistically significant (seven studies; OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.13-1.76; P = 0.27). Conclusion This meta-analysis revealed that USACDT significantly increased the success rate of thrombolysis compared to conventional catheter-directed thrombolysis. Furthermore, USACDT was associated with lower rate of complication and infusion time. Taken together, these findings confirm the superiority of this novel intervention over conventional catheter-directed thrombolysis in treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis.

Systematic review of inframalleolar endovascular interventions and rates of limb salvage, wound healing, restenosis, rest pain, reintervention and complications	VASCULAR			English	Review						Peripheral arterial disease; critical limb ischaemia; chronic limb threatening ischaemia; angioplasty; pedal artery; limb salvage; inframalleolar	PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL-DISEASE; THE-ANKLE ANGIOPLASTY; RISK-FACTORS; OUTCOMES; ARCH; MORBIDITY; MORTALITY; ISCHEMIA	Objectives Peripheral artery disease is estimated to affect 237 million individuals worldwide. Critical limb ischaemia, also known as chronic limb threatening ischaemia is a consequence of the progression of peripheral artery disease which occurs in similar to 21% of patients over a five-year period. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the use of additional below-the-ankle angioplasty in comparison to the use of above-the-ankle angioplasty alone, and the subsequent rates of amputation, wound healing, restenosis, rest pain, reintervention and complications. Methods This systematic review was undertaken in accordance with PRISMA guidelines following a registered protocol (CRD42019154893). Online databases were searched using a search strategy of 20 keywords. Included articles reported the outcome for inframalleolar (pedal artery, pedal arch, plantar arteries) angioplasty with additional proximal angioplasty in comparison to proximal angioplasty alone. GRADE assessment was applied to assess the quality of the evidence. Results After screening 1089 articles, 10 articles met the inclusion criteria. Comparative performance assessment of below-the-ankle with above-the-ankle versus above-the-ankle angioplasty alone was undertaken in 3 articles, with the remaining 7 articles reporting outcomes of below-the-ankle with above-the-ankle angioplasty with no distinct comparator group. Significant decrease in major lower limb amputation at the last follow-up in the below-the-ankle group when compared with the above-the-ankle angioplasty alone group was observed in a single study (3.45% vs. 14.9%, p < 0.05). Improved wound healing rate at follow-up in the below-the-ankle group versus above-the-ankle angioplasty alone group was also reported in a single study (59.3% vs. 38.1%, p < 0.05). Subsequent rate of amputation after below-the-ankle angioplasty has been estimated as 23.5%. Conclusion To date, there is a lack of studies assessing inframalleolar interventions and their use in improving limb salvage, wound healing and symptomatology. Prospective RCTs should be undertaken with adequate participant numbers to be sufficiently powered and report clinically important end-points.	[Machin, M.; Gueroult, A.

Methods A total of 83 patients (70% female, average age 56) underwent complex inferior vena cava filter retrieval between January 2015 and December 2019 utilizing either rigid endobronchial forceps (n = 69, 83%) and/or excimer laser (n = 20, 24%). Procedural variables were recorded. The incidence and size of caval pseudoaneurysms and extravasation along with treatment type and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results Technical success in all cases was 96% (n = 80). Average fluoroscopy time was 23 min (median: 20.2, range: 0.9-129.5). Average filter dwell time was 85 months (range: 2-316 months). Caval pseudoaneurysm was detected on post-retrieval venography in 10 patients (12%) and frank extravasation occurred in 1 case (1%). Average pseudoaneurysm length and width was 20.4 mm (range: 5-45 mm) and 12.9 mm (range: 4-24 mm), respectively. Pseudoaneurysms occurred most frequently during the removal of Optease (n = 5) and Celect (n = 2) filters. The pseudoaneurysms completely resolved with prolonged (>5 min) balloon angioplasty in all but one instance where a small portion of the pseudoaneurysm persisted. This patient was admitted and observed overnight before being discharged without complication. The solitary case of significant extravasation was effectively managed with immediate stent placement and the patient remained hemodynamically stable. Conclusions Radiographically detectable caval pseudoaneurysm and extravasation is not uncommon in complex inferior vena cava filter retrieval and, despite being considered a major complication by Society of Interventional Radiology guidelines, can often be managed without stenting or other invasive treatment.

J	Yao, YT; Xu, QX				Yao, Yuting; Xu, Qixia			Progress in the study of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism	VASCULAR			English	Review						Cancer; venous thromboembolism; pulmonary embolism; deep venous thrombosis	MOLECULAR-WEIGHT HEPARIN; VIENNA CANCER; HOSPITALIZED-PATIENTS; RISK-FACTORS; THROMBOPROPHYLAXIS; THROMBOSIS; CHEMOTHERAPY; VALIDATION; PLATELET; CELLS	Objective Venous thromboembolism is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and increased medical costs in tumor patients. In the current review, we summarize the progress made in the study of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism. Methods By searching cancer-associated venous thromboembolism-related literature on PubMed, the epidemiology, pathological mechanisms, risk factors, risk prediction models, and prevention and treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism were reviewed. Results The pathophysiological mechanisms of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism are multifactorial. Various blood cell counts (such as platelets and white blood cells) and biomarkers (such as D-dimer and sP-selectin) were considered predictors of thrombosis in cancer patients and were incorporated into the venous thromboembolism risk stratification models. Thromboprophylaxis is currently recommended for all hospitalized cancer patients. In addition, outpatient thromboprophylaxis can be used for selected high-risk patients. Low-molecular-weight heparin was the preferred treatment for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism, but some issues arose in the long-term treatment. In this case, direct oral anticoagulants were a treatment option for tumor patients. The efficacy of direct oral anticoagulant in treating cancer patients is not inferior to low-molecular-weight heparin, but is associated with a higher risk of bleeding. Therefore, there were concerns regarding their safety. Conclusion Since thrombocytopenia, thrombosis recurrence, and bleeding are common in tumor patients, the selection of anticoagulants in this circumstance is a considerable challenge for clinicians.

J	Kavala, AA; Kuserli, Y; Turkyilmaz, S				Kavala, Ali Aycan; Kuserli, Yusuf; Turkyilmaz, Saygin			Comparison of paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty with femoropopliteal bypass surgery in treating femoropopliteal lesions	VASCULAR			English	Article						Limb salvage; balloon angioplasty; coated; disease-free survival	ARTERY-DISEASE; METAANALYSIS	Objective To compare drug (paclitaxel)-coated balloon angioplasty with femoropopliteal bypass surgery in the treatment of femoropopliteal lesions. Methods A retrospective study was performed between January 2015 and January 2019, covering a four-year period. All subjects who underwent femoropopliteal bypass surgery and drug-coated balloon angioplasty over a four-year period were evaluated. The subjects' demographic characteristics, lesion characteristics, treatment outcomes and disease-free survival were collected. Subjects were divided into the femoropopliteal bypass group (Group A) and the drug-coated balloon angioplasty (Group B) group. Results In total, 220 subjects were enrolled. Both Group A and Group B consisted of 110 subjects. The proportion of patients with a claudication distance between 0 and 50 m was significantly higher in Group A, and the proportion of patients with a claudication distance between 50 and 100 m was significantly higher in Group B (p = 0.001). In terms of the Rutherford levels, moderate claudication was significantly higher in Group B, and severe claudication was significantly higher in Group A (p = 0.001). The lesion length for the subjects in Group A was significantly longer than that in Group B (24.61 +/- 2.79 mm for Group A and 18.59 +/- 3.95 mm for Group B,p = 0.001). The stenosis degree in Group A was also significantly higher than that in Group B (96.82 +/- 4.32% for Group A and 94.85 +/- 4.55% for Group B,p = 0.001). The duration of the procedure, duration of hospitalization and rate of bleeding in Group A were significantly higher than those in Group B. The incidence of overall morbidity and reintervention rates in Group B were significantly higher than that in Group A. The preoperative ankle brachial index values of the subjects in Group B were statistically significantly higher than those in Group A (0.56 +/- 0.08 for Group A and 0.61 +/- 0.08 for Group B,p = 0.001). The change in the ankle brachial index measurement of the subjects in Group A with respect to the preprocedure value was significantly greater than that in Group B (p = 0.001). For primary patency, there was a significant difference between the groups in the distribution of the duplex ultrasound results at the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th month control points (p = 0.001). At all control points, Group A had better primary patency rates, whereas the secondary patency rates did not differ. In total, among the 220 patients, 125 (56.8%) were disease free, and 95 (43.2%) experienced recurrence. The mean disease-free survival times for Group A and Group B were 10.45 +/- 0.28 months and 9.11 +/- 0.37 months, respectively. The disease-free survival rates were significantly higher in Group A (p = 0.001,p < 0.05). Conclusion Femoropopliteal bypass resulted in better disease-free survival rates than drug-coated balloon angioplasty and serves as an effective modality for the treatment of femoropopliteal lesions.

Safety and efficacy study of the wound care 360 degrees SiteSeal (R) vascular closure device in percutaneous cardiac catheterization procedures	VASCULAR			English	Article						Cardiac catheterization; femoral arterial access; vascular closure device; manual compression; hemostasis	SUTURE-MEDIATED CLOSURE; CORONARY INTERVENTION; ARTERIOTOMY CLOSURE; MANUAL COMPRESSION; ARTERIAL PUNCTURE; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; COMPLICATIONS; HEMOSTASIS; ACCESS; COST	Objectives Vascular access site complications after percutaneous transfemoral cardiovascular procedures remain a common cause of morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the SiteSeal (R) VCD for achieving hemostasis following diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Methods We conducted a prospective case control single center study to assess the safety and efficacy of SiteSeal (R) VCD compared to standard manual compression following diagnostic cardiac catheterization. Forty patients were enrolled in study to receive either SiteSeal (R) device or manual compression (20 in each group). Results Patients in the SiteSeal (R) group achieved hemostasis in a significantly shorter time (4 +/- 2.4 vs. 19 +/- 2.4 min,P < 0.001), had shorter time from hemostasis to ambulation (95 +/- 44 vs. 388 +/- 63 min,P < 0.001) and significantly earlier device deployment to discharge time compared to the manual compression group (4.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 8.9 +/- 4.8 h,P = 0.001). There was one non-major bleeding event in the SiteSeal (R) group which occurred >24 h after discharge from the hospital and was managed conservatively. In the remaining device patients, there was no clinical or Doppler ultrasound evidence of major or minor vascular complication with good overall patient comfort at discharge, 7 days and 30 days follow-up. Conclusions In this first clinical experience, the SiteSeal (R) VCD achieved safe and efficient hemostasis, allowed for earlier ambulation and faster discharge compared to manual compression.
