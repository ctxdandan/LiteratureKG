J	Biemans, JWA				Biemans, J. W. A.			Will Requirements for Last Wills Remain as They Are? The 'Physical Presence Requirement' of Witnesses and Notaries in the Light of the COVID-19 Interim Measures and the EU Freedom of (Notarial) Services	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						last wills; freedom of services; COVID-19; notarial wills; remote notarial deed		The COVID-19-crisis has exposed the shortcomings of formal requirements for legal acts which involve the physical presence of others. This is in particular true with regard to last wills which require the physical presence of a notary and/or witnesses, who have to authenticate and/or attest to the last will of the testator. In such cases, the physical presence requirement imposes an outright obstruction to passing a last will in times of COVID-19. Western countries have responded differently to COVID-19. In the civil-law jurisdictions where only notarial wills are offered, such as the Netherlands, the government has introduced interim measures allowing the testator (and witnesses, if required) to appear before the notary by audio-video technology, leading to authorized remote notarization and remote witnessing. The same has been done in common law jurisdictions where only witnessed wills are offered, including Australia, New Zealand and some states in the United States with regard to witnessing. The first part of this paper researches the different types of last wills and seeks to explain why countries have responded differently in this respect to COVID-19. The second part discusses the different solutions available and argues that solutions introducing audio-video technology as an alternative for physical presence are more favourable than other solutions. Remote authentication and remote witnessing leaves intact the existing will-types of the particular jurisdiction as they are, modernizing the presence requirement of the notary and/or the witnesses, while at the same time preserving legal certainty by anchoring these possibilities in legislation. Introducing audio-video technology in making last wills seems a logical step forward in the 21st century. Building on the two previous parts, the third part investigates a more fundamental issue relating to the physical presence requirement for notarial wills from a European Union free movement of services perspective. Discussing ECJ case law and two applicable directives, it shows that Member States are allowed to restrict the freedom of establishment of notaries and freedom to provide notarial services. These restrictions often lead to a domestic monopoly of notaries, where notaries appointed in the Member State offer exclusively notarial services under the legislation of that Member State, with the requirement that these notaries can only be established in and only offer their services that Member State. Combined with the physical presence requirement, these restrictions to the freedom of establishment and the freedom of services effectively force a testator desiring to make its last will before a notary to travel to the Member State of that notary. Even without COVID-19, it is the question whether this physical presence requirement unnecessarily restricts the freedom of services under art. 56 TFEU, as it deprives the notary and the testator of a rapid and direct technique of passing notarial wills. The possibility of remote authentication under interim legislation raises the question whether the physical presence requirement is objectively justified and proportionate to restrict the freedom of services.

J	Nicolosi, SF				Nicolosi, Salvatore F.			Addressing a Crisis through Law: EU Emergency Legislation and its Limits in the Field of Asylum INTRODUCTION	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Editorial Material						crisis; emergency legislation; derogations; asylum; migration; EU	REFUGEE CRISIS; INFLUX	The Common European Asylum System (CEAS) has been in a situation of protracted crisis. This has hampered its process of reform and has urged the European Commission to launch a new Pact on Migration and Asylum, in order to offer a 'fresh start' to 'build a system that manages and normalises migration for the long term.' While an emergency-driven approach has surfaced as a mandatory route for the future of the CEAS, what does constitute a situation of emergency in EU asylum law? In an attempt to unpack the evolution and understanding of the concept of 'emergency' in EU asylum law, the paper argues that the parameters to determine the existence of a situation of emergency have been politically controversial and purposefully left openended. This has consequences at the level of EU legislative responses. In particular, the paper will illustrate the potential and limits of the EU emergency legislation in the field of asylum and aims to explain how this legislation impacts both the ordinary legislation at the regulatory level as well as the legislative autonomy of the Member States in situations of emergency. Ultimately, the paper discusses whether the recently proposed legislative instruments, which are designed to address situations of crisis in the field of asylum, are well suited for this role.

Beginning by describing the rule of law backsliding in context, this article shows how civil society organisations reacted to the orchestrated threats to judicial independence in Poland. The article highlights the negative consequences of rule of law backsliding for the civic space, proving that the role of CSOs was not only to protect the rule of law (judicial independence, in particular), but also to fight the shrinking civic space. This article surveys the concept of the 'rule of law from below' by critically analysing the actions of CSOs in response to attempts to undermine judicial independence, providing a part of a broader 'rule of law backsliding' picture. The article concludes with a detailed analysis of two case studies - reactions from CSOs to Poland's so-called 'reform of the judiciary'.

J	Joppe, A				Joppe, Anne			EU Solidarity, Illustrated by the Covid-19 Crisis What does EU solidarity mean in the context of free movement of goods and persons and how is this illustrated by the response to the Covid-19 pandemic?	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						solidarity; internal market; Covid-19; EU principles; Article 2 TEU		Solidarity between the Member States of the EU is mostly called upon during times of crisis, as also now during the Covid-19 pandemic. In this article, the definition and importance of solidarity is studied with a focus on the internal market. It appears that solidarity does not have one unequivocal meaning, but that its importance and value depend per EU policy area. Yet, it is noteworthy that elements of reciprocity and altruism lie at the core of the value. In the context of the internal market, the principle is not referred to in the specific Treaty provisions on the fundamental freedoms. However, solidarity and the idea behind it can be enforced through the principle of loyalty within the meaning of Article 4(3) TEU. The reaction of the Union and the Member States to the Covid-19 outbreak illustrates how solidarity is reflected during crises. Studying the recent actions seems to confirm the conclusion that solidarity within the single market is rather a political aspiration, that is not legally binding or enforceable by itself. However, one could argue that this requires change, since it follows from the current pandemic that solidarity is crucial for the resilience of the internal market in times of crisis. The principle of loyalty can indeed play an instrumental role here and can be used to enforce the objectives of solidarity.

J	Tosza, S				Tosza, Stanislaw			Role of the Industry in the Enforcement of the Tobacco Policy	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						enforcement; illicit tobacco; tobacco industry; smuggling; counterfeiting; compliance	ILLICIT TRADE	Tobacco products are heavily regulated because, in particular, of their acknowledged harmfulness to health, with highly elevated prices as one of the most important means of discouraging consumption. One of the most serious threats to the effectiveness of the tobacco policy comes from the trafficking of illicit tobacco, which is much cheaper, often of lower quality, and which reduces state and EU revenues. The achievement of tobacco policy objectives, in particular the combatting of illicit tobacco trade, depends on the participation of private actors, amongst which big industry plays a crucial role. Yet, the legal landscape of enforcement duties of the tobacco industry is a patchwork of instruments, unevenly affecting different players. In particular it includes controversial agreements between the major tobacco producers and the EU and Member States, to which three out of four major producers are subject. The agreement with the fourth - PMI - was not extended by the Commission in 2016. The decision as to the extension of the remaining agreements is looming. The objective of this article is to analyse the framework of duties of the tobacco industry in the enforcement of the tobacco policy, especially against illicit tobacco, and to reflect on whether the enforcement model, including the agreements with the tobacco producers, should be kept or abandoned.

J	Harrison, R				Harrison, Ruairi			Tackling Disinformation in Times of Crisis: The European Commission's Response to the Covid-19 Infodemic and the Feasibility of a Consumer-centric Solution	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						Covid-19; fundamental rights; freedom of expression; Digital Services Act; European Commission; free speech; disinformation; content moderation; digital regulation		Since 2016, the European Commission has sought to take a proactive stance in addressing disinformation, with this stance evidently influenced by the divisive nature of disinformation and its ability to dissuade participation and trust in democratic institutions. Yet as the coronavirus pandemic brought fear and uncertainty to Europe and the wider world, how well equipped was the Commission's approach for the onslaught of health disinformation which accompanied the pandemic? Reflecting on the EU's soft law approach both before and after this 'Infodemic,' this article critically analyses the inherent difficulties in regulating disinformation and looks ahead to the Commission's proposed approach into the future. Finally, considering these inherent regulatory difficulties and the impact of the Infodemic, this paper reflects upon the feasibility of a 'consumer-centric' solution to tackling disinformation in the European Union.

Mobility in a European Post-Crisis Scenario: Law-Making Dynamics and Law-Enforcement Challenges	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Editorial Material						mobility; securitisation; neoliberalism; legislation; enforcement	REFUGEE CRISIS; SECURITIZATION; POLITICS	Security and mobility have become a seemingly inseparable concept in the recent European geopolitical landscape. While the historically deeply rooted social, economic and legal aspects of migration have been extensively studied, the current emphasis on emergency in mobility management, which has has been radically shaping the law-making and law-enforcement dynamics, has been rather underexplored. Taking stock of the challenges emerging in view of adjusting the law-making and enforcement set-up at the national and European levels to a context of emergency, this Special Issue pursues the ambitious goal of shedding light on the post-crisis controversial scenario of mobility in Europe, characterised by the political impasse over the reform of the overall European governance of migration. Based on a neoliberal conceptual framework, this multidisciplinary consideration of human mobility across European borders questions whether the crisis is really over or whether the sense of crisis is projected onto the future policy developments.

J	Gilder, A				Gilder, Alexander			UN Peace Operations and the Role of the Local in (Re)Building the Rule of Law	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						rule of law; UN peacekeeping; hybrid courts; local justice; MINUSCA; UNMISS	INTERNATIONAL RULE; STABILIZATION; PLURALISM; JUSTICE; LEGAL	UN peace operations undertake a broad array of rule of law activities aiming to rebuild the justice system and end impunity. Rule of law activities in UN peace operations have matured over the last 20 years since the UN experiments with statebuilding in Kosovo and East Timor. Today, rule of law activities can often clearly be seen to advance the broader goal of establishing the host state as the legitimate authority. This paper first discusses the UN's understanding of the rule of law and why the UN has chosen to underpin its peacebuilding agenda with ending impunity. Second, transitional justice in MINUSCA is discussed including the establishment of the Special Criminal Court. Third, UNMISS is investigated where the UN had an unprecedented challenge of ensuring the rule of law on protection of civilian sites. Lastly, the promise of local justice is assessed. It is suggested that while ending impunity and strengthening formal institutions can be important to ensure human rights violations do not persist, there needs to be an overarching, bottom-up strategy in place to engage and empower local communities, and other civil actors, to be part of the rule of law process.

J	Herrera, CB; Haeck, Y				Herrera, Clara Burbano; Haeck, Yves			The Historical and Present-Day Role of Non-Governmental Organisations before the Inter-American Human Rights System in Documenting Serious Human Rights Violations and Protecting Human Rights and the Rule of Law Through Ensuring Accountability	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						NGOs; rule of law; human rights; Inter-American Human Rights System; Inter-American Commission on Human Rights; Inter-American Court of Human Rights		From a Latin-American perspective, even in a context where the rule of law has been under attack or has been very weak, the role of human rights NGOs has been and is very relevant in terms of documenting human rights violations, and seeking and bringing justice for the victims of those violations, as well as acting as a guardian angel to the Inter-American human rights system. The role of NGOs within the Inter-American human rights system has to be understood taking into account the specific political and the legal-normative context on the continent. Indeed, the role played by human rights NGOs in the Americas has responded/responds to the political reality of repressive regimes and present-day fragile democracies struggling to uphold human rights and rule of law standards. Furthermore, the legal-normative context, i.e. the American Convention on Human Rights and the interpretation given by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to its provisions, has also given and gives NGOs ample space to interact through different methods and strategies in a less active to a very active manner with the human rights monitoring bodies from 1959 on.

The application of this principle has become particularly controversial as states adopt stricter regulations to tackle climate change with retroactive effect, and investors challenge such regulations before international courts and tribunals. In the context of criminal law, the principle is widespread and has become a binding norm of international law. However, a survey of domestic jurisdictions and decisions of international courts and tribunals shows that that there is no general principle of international law which forbids the retroactive application of administrative law. Despite pronouncements of some international courts and tribunals to the contrary, states can conclude treaties and adopt administrative regulations with retroactive effect to pursue legitimate public policy objectives.

The aim of this paper is to establish the reasons for delays in proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Courts in the Czech Republic and in Poland, to analyze why they exist, and to formulate proposals on how the structural and procedural activity of these courts could be organized more effectively. The international and national standards as well as the Polish and the Czech standards pertaining to the right to have one's case heard within reasonable time and the reasons for unjustified delays will be examined, and the explanations for their occurrence will be provided. Proposals will then be formulated on how to make the procedures more effective. The ideas formulated are relevant in both countries for the two judicial systems, but also for other judiciaries, which also experience the same problems with system delays.

J	Minderhoud, P				Minderhoud, Paul			Regulation of EU Labour Migration: At a Crossroads after the New Pact on Migration and Asylum?	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						labour migration; EU regulation; New Pact on Migration; competences; common EU policy		The 2020 New Pact on Migration and Asylum could have been the perfect opportunity for the Commission to address and overcome the crisis in the field of a common EU labour migration policy by getting it back on track. But nothing was further from the truth. The attention which the Commission devotes to the subject of EU labour migration in the New Pact is disappointing. It even seems as though the Commission is abdicating its responsibility and leaving it up to the Member States to make national policy in this area. EU labour migration policy has always been a battle ground between the EU and the Member States. It has led to a highly fragmented EU policy that is proving to be ineffective and is generating resistance rather than contributing to a common policy. This article describes and analyses the EU labour migration policy as it has been shaped since 2000, framing it in a post-crisis dilemma. After the failure of an ambitious proposal for a common comprehensive approach to the admission and residence conditions of third country national workers in general, the Commission opted for a sectoral approach, which so far has led to the establishment of four labour migration Directives, namely for highly skilled workers, seasonal workers, intra-corporate transferees and a single permit for residence and work procedure. Due to the 2015 refugee crisis, the Commission has mainly focused on asylum related issues during the last few years. With regard to EU labour migration regulation, barely any new initiative has been taken. The only EU institutional player which seriously challenges the addressing of the post-crisis situation in this area is the European Parliament. Are we at a crossroads regarding the regulation of EU labour migration?

J	Weissensteiner, M				Weissensteiner, Monika			Cross-Border Police Cooperation and 'Secondary Movements'. On Reconfigurations in Enforcing Differential Mobility Rights within the Spatial-Legal Schengen Space	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						Schengen; cross-border police cooperation; secondary movements; Dublin system; article 23 Schengen Borders Code (SBC)	EUROPEAN-UNION; CONSEQUENCES; READMISSION; SOLIDARITY; LAW	In the context of the so-called 'migration crisis', besides the politically more contentious introduction of border controls, on intra-European borders member states responded to onward mobilities - so-called 'secondary movements' - through border-area controls, bilateral (fast track) readmissions and increasingly through joint patrolling of main cross-border routes. This article sets out to reflect upon the 'Schengen crisis' not by discussing the introduction of border controls, but by focusing on ordinary means of enforcement through border-area policing (Article 23 Schengen Borders Code) and through instruments of police cooperation, such as through joint patrolling or bilateral readmissions. By scrutinising the legal regimes of these instruments, plural in both scale and temporality, this article contributes to reflecting upon the productive reconfigurations in times of 'crisis' of the EU order and its enforcement.

J	Safradin, B; de Vries, S; de Heer, S				Safradin, Barbara; de Vries, Sybe; de Heer, Simona			Fundamental Social Rights Protection and Covid-19 in the EU: Constraints & Possibilities	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						EU Charter of Fundamental Rights; social justice; social fundamental rights; EU social policy; solidarity; Covid-19		The Covid-19 pandemic has had major socio-economic consequences, particularly for critical workers such as healthcare workers, seasonal workers and platform workers in their social rights enjoyment. This article analyses how EU law could protect social rights in times of Covid-19, with a specific focus on the possibilities and limits of the EU Charter in times of crisis for these certain categories of EU workers. The potential of EU legal instruments to protect vulnerable workers' social rights is limited both by the limited legislative competences in the social policy field and the limited scope of application of the EU Charter. Furthermore, social rights enshrined in the Charter are often formulated as principles, which means they cannot be invoked directly in court, but need to be elaborated in legislation. Nevertheless, the EU could further strengthen the potential of social rights in the EU legal order through harmonisation of social standards in two ways. First, by harmonisation of social rights using the legal bases in the Treaty. Secondly, by implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights effectively and by improving application of the EU Charter at national level, both by clarifying and broadening horizontal direct effect as by increasing application of the EU Charter by national policymakers and the judiciary and raising awareness.

J	Buyse, A; Fortin, K; Leyh, BM; Fraser, J; Borisov, B				Buyse, Antoine; Fortin, Katharine; Leyh, Brianne McGonigle; Fraser, Julie; Borisov, Boyko			The Rule of Law from Below - A Concept Under Development INTRODUCTION	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Editorial Material						rule of law from below; legal concepts; human rights; civil society		The rule of law is a central notion in legal thought and in the practice of democratic states. While a contested term, scholars have articulated its contours - both formal and substantive. This includes ideas such as legal certainty, prospectivity, access to justice, and the fact that everyone should be accountable under the law. Much of the scholarship has centred on states and international organisations as the primary entities responsible for protecting the rule of law. By contrast, the relationship between individuals and groups of people in civil society vis-a-vis the rule of law is under-explored in (international) law. This special issue is therefore dedicated to elaborating upon this relationship - the 'rule of law from below.' This Introduction sets out the concept and illustrates it with examples of the innovative ways that people are using in practice to support the rule of law from below. While noting that the concept of 'rule of law from below' is one under development, we argue that there is much value in investigating instances where actors beyond formal state institutions, who have no constitutional or other formal legal role, take it upon themselves to uphold and defend the rule of law. This is especially important in today's global context of shifts in power between state and non-state actors, as well as pervasive democratic and rule-of-law backsliding.

J	Frediani, E				Frediani, Emiliano			The Administrative Precautionary Approach at the Time of Covid-19: The Law of Uncertain Science and the Italian Answer to Emergency	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						precaution in the books and in action; Covid-19; administrative powers; non-reducible uncertainty; law of uncertain science; adaptive decisions in time of crisis; Italian answer to emergency; timeliness of action	PRINCIPLE	The health emergency linked to Covid-19 brought to the fore the problem of the usefulness and correct application of the precautionary principle. In the paper proposed for the call, the topic will be analyzed starting from the foundations of the precautionary principle, to see consequently how it must be 'handled' in practice when the Administration (in the Italian fight against the pandemic, the Government, but also the Regions) is called to decide in contexts of health crisis. Particular attention will be paid, just from the beginning, to the relationship between science and Public Administration, in order to demonstrate how the precautionary approach represents a 'rule of action' for the public decision-maker when there is no full scientific certainty. In this perspective, the analysis will be developed starting from the definition of a general context: that one represented by the so-called 'irreducible uncertainty.' This premise will be the starting point to define a law of uncertain science,' which 'follows' the facts and is characterized for its flexibility. The problem will then be reported to the administrative decisions, called in emergency times to be 'adaptive' and reviewable. The reflection on precaution 'in action' will have the Italian case as an observation 'laboratory.' In this perspective, the investigation will be conducted by looking at the 'answer' of the Italian legal system to the emergency related to Covid-19. This will lead to see if the precautionary approach has been taken seriously by the Italian Administration and, subsequently, what characters have taken the measures to fight against the spread of the Coronavirus outbreak. In conclusion, it will be necessary to understand whether the 'postulates' of precaution 'in the books' have been translated into an adequate precaution 'in action.' In other terms, the attention will be focused on two different aspects: the first related to the 'time' of the action; the second to the content of the measures taken to fight against the spread of the virus. This will allow us to understand if the Italian Government acted promptly (in compliance with the precautionary approach) and what was the decision making process that brought to these measures.

J	Gkliati, M; Kilpatrick, J				Gkliati, Mariana; Kilpatrick, Jane			Crying Wolf Too Many Times: The Impact of the Emergency Narrative on Transparency in FRONTEX Joint Operations	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						Frontex; transparency; securitisation; crisis; borders; fundamental rights	EUROPEAN-UNION; EU; SECURITIZATION; CRISIS; BORDER	Crisis-driven EU policy in recent years fits within a securitisation narrative, in which the claim of public security threat outweighs fundamental rights and their accountability safeguards. Under this policy development, Frontex, the EU Border and Coast Guard Agency, has experienced an impressive expansion in its powers and competences, without the equivalent enhancement of accountability safeguards. This article focuses in particular on the issue of transparency as a fundamental right and an element of social and political accountability. Specifically, it examines how lack of transparency in complex multi-actor structures, such as Frontex joint operations, can result in gaps in accountability and impact the enforcement of basic fundamental rights of EU citizens and migrants. Using a conceptual perspective of accountability and securitisation, and highlighting specific gaps in transparency in the context of Frontex joint operations, this article aims to show how the lack of transparency has been determined by the situation of emergency and has continued to remain unaddressed due to a constant state of institutional emergency, feeding back into the perpetuation of the securitisation narrative.

J	Volberda, H				Volberda, Hidde			Crises, Creditors and Cramdowns: An evaluation of the protection of minority creditors under the WHOA in light of Directive (EU) 2019/1023	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						Restructuring Directive; WHOA; SMEs; insolvency; corporate rescue; Covid-19	INSOLVENCY; LAW	Covid-19 has severe economic consequences, leading to an increasing amount of businesses facing overwhelming debts. Since the financial crisis of 2008 the European Union has taken on a more rescue-oriented approach towards bankruptcy, resulting in Directive (EU) 2019/1023. This Directive creates a framework for pre-insolvency restructuring, thereby avoiding unnecessary bankruptcies. Accordingly, pre-insolvency restructuring is a valuable instrument in mitigating the negative economic effects of Covid-19. The Netherlands has recently adopted the Act on the Confirmation of Private Plans (WHOA), National Legislation on pre-insolvency restructuring. In order to balance the rights of secured and unsecured creditors the 20%-rule was adopted. This rule guarantees small-scale Small-to-Midsized (SME)-creditors the right to satisfaction of 20% of their claims in restructuring proceedings. In this paper, I evaluate whether the 20%-rule is in accordance with the Directive. I argue that the 20%-rule is in line with the Directive, but that the overly restrictive system of judicial review under the WHOA hampers its application in practice. Therefore, the Dutch legislator should allow for more room for judicial interpretation on the suitability of the application of the 20%-rule. This more nuanced approach better aligns the 20%-rule with the European Restructuring Directive.

J	Marcen, AG				Marcen, Ana Gascon			The Platform for the Protection of Journalists: A Mechanism for Cooperation between Non-Governmental Organisations and the Council of Europe	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						Council of Europe; media freedom; safety of journalists; civil society	NGOS	The decrease in journalist safety and media freedom has a negative impact on the rule of law because journalists cannot act as public watchdogs. Its deterioration in Europe during the last decade is a worrying trend for society as a whole. The Council of Europe has tried to fight against it through the creation of a public Internet-based Platform for the protection of journalism and the safety of journalists. The Platform receives alerts from non-governmental organisations such as journalist associations and this serves as an early warning mechanism for the Council of Europe. Non-governmental organisations act as partners of this International Organisation and in that way they protect the rule of law from below. A simple search of the Platform permits to see the many threats journalists face in Europe every day. This paper assesses how the Platform works. It is a positive initiative to co-operate with civil society that still has to improve its results mainly through a more effective engagement of the Member States of the Council of Europe.

J	Kool, RSB; Kerssies, S; van der Rijst, T				Kool, Renee Sharon Barbara; Kerssies, Senna; van der Rijst, Tessa			'Mind the (Knowledge) Gap': Towards a Criminal Duty to Report Child Sexual Abuse?	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						child sexual abuse; disclosure; (mandatory) duty to report		Over the past few decades, child sexual abuse ('CSA') has become recognized as a serious and major problem in modern societies. Consequently, a common denominator in modern government policy is that CSA must be criminalized and pro-actively enforced. However, if national authorities are to be able to enforce, knowledge about the abuse is essential. Yet the disclosing of information to the authorities is hampered by the hidden nature of the offence. According to the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (Lanzarote) and EU Directive 2011/93 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children, Member States should 'encourage any person' who knows about or suspects CSA to report this to the relevant authorities. To encourage such disclosure, several European governments have introduced mandatory reporting systems imposing a (non-criminal) duty on designated professionals to report information about or suspicions of CSA to the competent authorities. This article examines whether introducing a criminal duty to report CSA could be recommendable for the European Union or the Council of Europe in order to improve Member States' knowledge of CSA and thus protect children more effectively against this type of violence. Using the outcomes of our recent study into the possibilities and impossibilities of extending the present Dutch criminal duty (aangifteplicht)to report rape, we argue that a criminal duty to report CSA is not recommendable as a means to encourage CSA disclosure by third parties.

J	Mak, E				Mak, Elaine			Travelling with Judges: Brief Reflections on the Roadmap on Comparative Law Developed by the Network of Presidents of the Supreme Judicial Courts of the European Union INTRODUCTION	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Editorial Material								This article accompanies a Roadmap on the judicial use of comparative law, which was developed by judges from different European supreme courts. This document is published in this issue of Utrecht Law Review. Brief reflections on relevant scholarly aspects help the reader to appreciate the meaning and value of this Roadmap for contemporary judicial functioning in Member States of the European Union. Addressed aspects concern the legitimacy of judicial comparativism and the methodological quality of the Roadmap. This analysis leads to a conclusion about the Roadmap's potential to enhance the quality of judicial decision-making and support dialogues of courts with their foreign counterparts as well as with other legal and societal audiences.

J	van den Brink, T; Gargantini, M				van den Brink, Ton; Gargantini, Matteo			Models of Solidarity in the EMU. The Impact of COVID-19 After Weiss	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						EMU; EU economic governance; COVID-19; European Central Bank; fiscal union; fiscal solidarity; corona recovery fund	EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK; ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE; ACCOUNTABILITY; DEBT; INDEPENDENCE; ECB	Right in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, the German federal constitutional court (Bundesverfassungsgericht - FCC) issued a ruling that sent massive shockwaves through the continent. Not only did the Court question the legality of the European Central Bank's bond buying program PSPP (Public Sector Purchase Program), but it also rejected the earlier decision by the CJEU in which this latter had found that program to respect EU law. The ruling is as such not directly concerned with Covid-19 measures, but it may have nonetheless important consequences thereon. In this contribution we will explore what those consequences may be. Apart from the direct effects on the ECB's pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), we zoom in on the ruling's indirect consequences on the broader question of how to arrange solidarity in EMU. With regard to the latter, we contend that Weiss and the Covid-19 crises combined will test the basic models of solidarity the EMU relies upon: the models of individual fiscal responsibility, ECB based solidarity and the model of fiscal union. These models are assessed from economic, constitutional and democratic perspectives.

J	Siegel, D				Siegel, Dina			The 'Crises' of Lesbos	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						crisis; Lesbos; migration; history; ethnography		Since 2015 hundreds of thousands of migrants have arrived on the Greek island of Lesbos, many fleeing war and poverty, others hoping to find work in Europe and give their children a better future. The arrival of migrants on Lesbos was accompanied by an influx of 'humanitarian pilgrims': hordes of journalists, celebrities, academic researchers and volunteers for diverse NGOs. Because the migrants arrived in such large numbers in 2015, they became part of the daily reality of both the local residents and officials at different levels of authority, from local municipalities to EU representatives. The migrants' arrival on the island was presented in the media both as a historic event and an urgent public problem. The term 'refugee crisis' was born. Although its importance and urgency was widely recognized by policymakers, the inability of European and local institutions to manage the influx of migrants in this time of crisis soon became obvious. This 'unmanageable' situation, which demanded quick and creative solutions, involved responding to the suffering of the migrants who needed 'to be managed', and appealing to the local people's solidarity and hospitality. The announcement that hundreds of thousands of refugees were arriving on the shores of Greece came at a time when the country was facing severe political and economic problems. The question is when is something 'announced' as a crisis and by whom, and which parties define and create a specific public problem and also suggest solutions and remedies. Based on an empirical case study in Greece, this contribution reflects on the concept of 'Crisis' from an interdisciplinary perspective, including a historical, philosophical and sociological understanding of its use in the refugee context.

Stopping a Virus from Moving Freely: Border Controls and Travel Restrictions in Times of Corona	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						free movement of persons; Schengen; borders; Covid-19; EU citizenship		One year down the road, this article evaluates the travel restrictions imposed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, first, in the light of the rules of the Schengen acquis (controls at the internal and external borders) and, second, under the provisions on the free movement of EU citizens. It will be argued that, as often is times of crisis, the existing legal framework has proven inadequate to respond to unforeseen circumstances. The result has been the primacy of national executive action. Despite the active role of the EU institutions in coordinating national responses and bringing them in line with EU law, ultimately, more binding coordination and regulation is required to ensure legal certainty and manage mobility, especially if the coronavirus is here to stay.

J	Leyh, BM				Leyh, Brianne McGonigle			The Role of Universities and Law Schools in Documenting Serious International Crimes and Advancing the Rule of Law	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						atrocitycrimes; documentation; investigation; civil society; universities; accountability	CIVIL-SOCIETY; EDUCATION	Looking at how the rule of law is protected, defended, or even advanced by non-state actors operating below the state level is vitally important in understanding how rule of law principles get recognized, operationalized, and implemented. This article aims to contribute to a growing strand of scholarship looking at how the rule of law is protected and bolstered 'from below.' It does this by exploring the role of a specific type of civil society actor in the documentation and investigation of serious international crimes and efforts at accountability, namely the university. Over the last decade, there has been a transformation of human rights fact-finding and how it impacts the rule of law and accountability for serious international crimes. Universities, often through their legal clinics, are making significant contributions to the rule of law and accountability efforts. It explores what implications the role of independent documenter or investigator has for academic institutions in protecting and advancing the rule of law. It calls for greater recognition of societal engagement with universities and for more research on the impacts of universities and students on advancing the rule of law and accountability for serious international crimes.

J	Heinikoski, S; Hyttinen, T				Heinikoski, Saila; Hyttinen, Tatu			The Erosion of Borderless Norden? Practices and Discourses on Nordic Border Restrictions in Finland and Sweden during the Covid-19 Pandemic	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						free movement; Schengen; Nordic countries; European Union; covid-19; fundamental rights		Nordic countries are part of the borderless Schengen Area, but free movement in the Nordic countries, or Norden, dates back even further: no border controls or restrictions on workers' movements have existed since the entry into force of the Nordic labour market and passport union in 1958. This article outlines how Finland and its neighbour Sweden, the only Nordic country to keep borders open for Finland in 2020, approached closed borders in Norden during the Covid-19 pandemic, when free movement of Nordic citizens was suspended for the first time in almost 70 years, to be restored only in summer 2021. The article examines the Finnish and Swedish border practices and political debates. Parliamentary discourses are analysed from the perspective of two ideal types of argumentation, namely utilitarian and deontological, arguing that the suspension of free movement leaves long-lasting scars in the trust of both politicians and citizens in interaction across borders.

J	Tsampi, A				Tsampi, Aikaterini			The Role of Civil Society in Monitoring the Executive in the Case-Law of the European Court of Human Rights: Recasting the Rule of Law	UTRECHT LAW REVIEW			English	Article						rule of law; civil society; monitoring of the executive; European Court of Human Rights; bad faith; separation of powers; accountability		This article explores the role of civil society in monitoring the executive as perceived by the European Court of Human Rights. Although this role is traditionally associated with the judici-ary and the legislature, in light of the institutional mutations in modern States, the ECtHR case-law envisages a multitude of forms through which civil society can monitor the government and thus uphold the 'rule of law from below.' In addressing this recasting of the rule of law, the article discusses in particular the role of good and bad faith on the part of both the State and civil society. The ECtHR case-law on the mala fides restrictions of rights under Article 18 ECHR highlights the idea that the monitoring of the executive by civil society is even more crucial in States where the rule of law is suffering from a systemic point of view and thus civil society is the only entity within the State that can genuinely monitor the executive. Civil society, on its part, should exercise these monitoring functions in good faith.
